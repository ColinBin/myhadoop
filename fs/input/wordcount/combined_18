 the conceited 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 it was the month of may the wind still blew cold but from bush 
 and tree field and flower came the welcome sound spring is 
 come in profusion covered the hedges under the 
 little spring seemed busy and told his tale from one of 
 the branches which hung fresh and blooming and covered with 
 delicate pink blossoms that were just ready to open the branch well 
 knew how beautiful it was this knowledge exists as much in the leaf 
 as in the blood i was therefore not surprised when a 
 carriage in which sat the young countess stopped in the road just 
 by she said that an was a most lovely object and an 
 emblem of spring in its most charming aspect then the branch was 
 broken off for her and she held it in her delicate hand and 
 sheltered it with her silk parasol then they drove to the castle 
 in which were lofty halls and splendid pure white 
 curtains fluttered before the open windows and beautiful flowers 
 stood in shining transparent vases and in one of them which 
 looked as if it had been cut out of newly fallen snow the 
 was placed among some fresh light twigs of beech it 
 was a charming sight then the branch became proud which was very much like human nature 
 
 people of every description entered the room and according to 
 their position in society so dared they to express their admiration some few said nothing others expressed too much and the very soon got to understand that there was as much difference in the characters of human beings as in those of plants and flowers some are all for pomp and parade others have a great deal to do to maintain their own importance while the rest might be spared without much loss to society so thought the as he stood before the open window from which he could see out over gardens and fields where there were flowers and plants enough for him to think and reflect upon some rich and beautiful some poor and humble indeed 
 
 poor despised herbs said the there is really 
 a difference between them and such as i am how unhappy they must 
 be if they can feel as those in my position do there is a difference 
 indeed and so there ought to be or we should all be equals 
 
 and the looked with a sort of pity upon them especially on a certain little flower that is found in fields and in ditches no one bound these flowers together in a nosegay they were too common they were even known to grow between the shooting up everywhere like bad weeds and they bore the very ugly name of or dandelions 
 
 poor despised plants said the it is not your 
 fault that you are so ugly and that you have such an ugly name but 
 it is with plants as with men there must be a difference 
 
 a difference cried the sunbeam as he kissed the blooming 
 and then kissed the yellow dandelion out in the 
 fields all were brothers and the sunbeam kissed them the poor 
 flowers as well as the rich 
 
 the had never thought of the boundless love of god 
 which extends over all the works of creation over everything which 
 lives and moves and has its being in him he had never thought of 
 the good and beautiful which are so often hidden but can never remain forgotten by him not only among the lower creation but also among men the sunbeam the ray of light knew better 
 
 you do not see very far nor very clearly he said to the 
 which is the despised plant you so specially pity 
 
 the dandelion he replied no one ever places it in a 
 nosegay it is often trodden under foot there are so many of them 
 and when they run to seed they have flowers like wool which fly away in little pieces over the roads and cling to the dresses of the 
 people they are only weeds but of course there must be weeds o i am really very thankful that i was not made like one of these 
 flowers 
 
 there came presently across the fields a whole group of 
 children the youngest of whom was so small that it had to be 
 carried by the others and when he was seated on the grass among 
 the yellow flowers he laughed aloud with joy kicked out his little 
 legs rolled about plucked the yellow flowers and kissed them in 
 childlike innocence the elder children broke off the flowers with 
 long stems bent the stalks one round the other to form links and 
 made first a chain for the neck then one to go across the 
 shoulders and hang down to the waist and at last a wreath to wear 
 round the head so that they looked quite splendid in their garlands 
 of green stems and golden flowers but the eldest among them 
 gathered carefully the faded flowers on the stem of which was grouped together the seed in the form of a white feathery coronal these loose airy are very beautiful and look like fine 
 snowy feathers or down the children held them to their mouths and 
 tried to blow away the whole coronal with one puff of the breath 
 they had been told by their grandmothers that who ever did so would be sure to have new clothes before the end of the year the despised flower was by this raised to the position of a prophet or foreteller of 
 events 
 
 do you see said the sunbeam do you see the beauty of these 
 flowers do you see their powers of giving pleasure 
 yes to children said the 
 
 an old woman came into the field and with a blunt 
 knife without a handle began to dig round the roots of some of the 
 and pull them up with some of these she intended to make tea for herself but the rest she was going to sell to the 
 chemist and obtain some money 
 
 but beauty is of higher value than all this said the 
 branch only the chosen ones can be admitted into the realms of the 
 beautiful there is a difference between plants just as there is a 
 difference between men 
 
 then the sunbeam spoke of the boundless love of god as seen in 
 creation and over all that lives and of the equal distribution of 
 his gifts both in time and in eternity 
 
 that is your opinion said the 
 
 then some people came into the room and among them the young 
 countess the lady who had placed the in the 
 transparent vase so pleasantly beneath the rays of the sunlight 
 she carried in her hand something that seemed like a flower the 
 object was hidden by two or three great leaves which covered it 
 like a shield so that no draught or gust of wind could injure it and 
 it was carried more carefully than the had ever been 
 very cautiously the large leaves were removed and there appeared 
 the feathery of the despised dandelion this was what the 
 lady had so carefully plucked and carried home so safely covered 
 so that not one of the delicate feathery arrows of which its 
 shape was so lightly formed should flutter away she now drew it 
 forth quite uninjured and wondered at its beautiful form and airy 
 lightness and singular construction so soon to be blown away by 
 the wind 
 
 see she exclaimed how wonderfully god has made this little 
 flower i will paint it with the together every one 
 admires the beauty of the but this humble flower has been endowed by heaven with another kind of loveliness and although they differ in appearance both are the children of the realms of beauty 
 
 then the sunbeam kissed the lowly flower and he kissed the 
 blooming upon whose leaves appeared a rosy blush

 of beauty 
 virtue is like a rich stone best plain set and surely virtue is best in a body that 
 is comely though not of delicate features and that hath rather dignity of presence 
 than beauty of aspect neither is it almost seen that very beautiful persons are 
 otherwise of great virtue as if nature were rather busy not to err than in labour 
 to produce excellency and therefore they prove accomplished but not of great spirit and study rather behaviour than virtue but this holds not always for augustus caesar titus vespasianus philip ie belle of france edward the fourth of england alcitriades of athens ismael the sophy of persia were all high and great spirits and yet e most beautiful men of their times in beauty that of favour is more than that of colour and that of decent and gracious motion more than that of favour 
 
 that is the best part of beauty which a picture cannot express no nor the first 
 sight of the life there is no excellent beauty that hath not some strangeness in 
 the proportion a man cannot tell whether apelles or albert durer were the more 
 trifler whereof the one would make a personage by geometrical proportions the other by taking the best parts out of divers faces to make one excellent such personages i think would please nobody but the painter that made them not but i think a painter may make a better face than ever was but he must do it by a kind of felicity as a musician that maketh an excellent air in music and not by rule 
 a man shall see faces that if you examine them part by part you shall find never a good and yet all together do well if it be true that the principal part of beauty is in decent motion certainly it is no marvel though persons in years seem many times more amiable pulchravmautumnuspiijcher for no youth can be comely but by pardon and considering the youth as to make up the comeliness 
 beauty is as summer fruits which are easy to corrupt and cannot last and for the most part it makes a dissolute youth and an age a little out of countenance but yet certainly again if it light well it maketh virtues shine and vices blush

 sums deposited with laffitte 
 on the other hand he remained as simple as on the first day he had gray hair a serious eye the sunburned complexion of a laborer the thoughtful visage of a philosopher 
 he habitually wore a hat with a wide brim and a long coat of coarse cloth buttoned to the chin he fulfilled his duties as mayor but with that exception he lived in solitude 
 he spoke to but few people 
 he avoided polite attentions he escaped quickly he smiled to relieve himself of the necessity of talking he gave in order to get rid of the necessity for smiling the women said of him what a bear 
 his pleasure consisted in strolling in the fields 
 he always took his meals alone with an open book before him which he read 
 he had a little library 
 he loved books books are cold but safe friends 
 in proportion as leisure came to him with fortune he seemed to take advantage of it to cultivate his mind 
 it had been observed that ever since his arrival at m sur m his language had grown more polished more choice and more gentle with every passing year 
 he liked to carry a gun with him on his strolls but he rarely made use of it when he did happen to do so his shooting was something so infallible as to inspire terror 
 he never killed an inoffensive animal he never shot at a little bird 
 although he was no longer young it was thought that he was still prodigiously strong 
 he offered his assistance to any one who was in need of it lifted a horse released a wheel clogged in the mud or stopped a runaway bull by the horns 
 he always had his pockets full of money when he went out but they were empty on his return when he passed through a village the ragged brats ran joyously after him and surrounded him like a swarm of gnats 
 it was thought that he must in the past have lived a country life since he knew all sorts of useful secrets which he taught to the peasants 
 he taught them how to destroy scurf on wheat by sprinkling it and the granary and inundating the cracks in the floor with a solution of common salt and how to chase away weevils by hanging up orviot in bloom everywhere on the walls and the ceilings among the grass and in the houses 
 he had recipes for exterminating from a field blight tares foxtail and all parasitic growths which destroy the wheat he defended a rabbit warren against rats simply by the odor of a which he placed in it 
 one day he saw some country people busily engaged in pulling up nettles he examined the plants which were uprooted and already dried and said 
 they are dead 
 nevertheless it would be a good thing to know how to make use of them 
 when the nettle is young the leaf makes an excellent vegetable when it is older it has filaments and fibres like hemp and flax 
 nettle cloth is as good as linen cloth chopped up nettles are good for poultry pounded they are good for horned cattle 
 the seed of the nettle mixed with fodder gives gloss to the hair of animals the root mixed with salt produces a beautiful yellow moreover it is an excellent hay which can be cut twice 
 and what is required for the nettle 
 a little soil no care no culture 
 only the seed falls as it is ripe and it is difficult to collect it 
 that is all with the exercise of a little care the nettle could be made useful it is neglected and it becomes hurtful 
 it is exterminated 
 how many men resemble the nettle 
 he added after a pause 
 remember this my friends 
 there are no such things as bad plants or bad men there are only bad cultivators 
 the children loved him because he knew how to make charming little trifles of straw and cocoanuts 
 when he saw the door of a church hung in black he entered he sought out funerals as other men seek christenings 
 widowhood and the grief of others attracted him because of his great gentleness he mingled with the friends clad in mourning with families dressed in black with the priests groaning around a coffin he seemed to like to give to his thoughts for text these funereal psalmodies filled with the vision of the other world 
 with his eyes fixed on heaven he listened with a sort of aspiration towards all the mysteries of the infinite those sad voices which sing on the verge of the obscure abyss of death 
 he performed a multitude of good actions concealing his agency in them as a man conceals himself because of evil actions 
 he penetrated houses privately at night he ascended staircases furtively a poor wretch on returning to his attic would find that his door had been opened sometimes even forced during his absence the poor man made a clamor over it 
 some malefactor had been there he entered and the first thing he beheld was a piece of gold lying forgotten on some piece of furniture 
 the malefactor who had been there was father madeleine 
 he was affable and sad 
 the people said 
 there is a rich man who has not a haughty air 
 there is a happy man who has not a contented air 
 some people maintained that he was a mysterious person and that no one ever entered his chamber which was a regular cell furnished with winged and enlivened by and skulls of dead men 
 this was much talked of so that one of the elegant and malicious young women of m sur m came to him one day and asked 
 monsieur le maire pray show us your chamber it is said to be a grotto 
 he smiled and introduced them instantly into this grotto 
 they were well punished for their curiosity the room was very simply furnished in mahogany which was rather ugly like all furniture of that sort and hung with paper worth twelve sous they could see nothing remarkable about it except two candlesticks of antique pattern which stood on the and appeared to be silver for they were an observation full of the type of wit of petty towns 
 nevertheless people continued to say that no one ever got into the room and that it was a cave a mysterious retreat a hole a tomb 
 it was also whispered about that he had immense sums deposited with laffitte with this peculiar feature that they were always at his immediate disposal so that it was added m madeleine could make his appearance at any morning sign a receipt and carry off his two or three millions in ten minutes 
 in reality these two or three millions were reducible as we have said to six hundred and thirty or forty thousand francs

 book two 
 chapter xv 
 
 between three and four in the afternoon prince andrew who had persisted in his request to kutuzov arrived at grunth and reported himself to bagration adjutant had not yet reached detachment and the battle had not yet begun in detachment no one knew anything of the general position of affairs they talked of peace but did not believe in its possibility others talked of a battle but also disbelieved in the nearness of an engagement bagration knowing bolkonski to be a favorite and trusted adjutant received him with distinction and special marks of favor explaining to him that there would probably be an engagement that day or the next and giving him full liberty to remain with him during the battle or to join the rearguard and have an eye on the order of retreat which is also very important 
 however there will hardly be an engagement today said bagration as if to reassure prince andrew 
 if he is one of the ordinary little staff dandies sent to earn a medal he can get his reward just as well in the rearguard but if he wishes to stay with me let him be of use here if a brave officer thought bagration prince andrew without replying asked the permission to ride round the position to see the disposition of the forces so as to know his bearings should he be sent to execute an order the officer on duty a handsome elegantly dressed man with a diamond ring on his forefinger who was fond of speaking french though he spoke it badly offered to conduct prince andrew 
 on all sides they saw officers with dejected faces who seemed to be seeking something and soldiers dragging doors benches and fencing from the village 
 there now prince we stop those fellows said the staff officer pointing to the soldiers the officers keep them in hand and there he pointed to a tent they crowd in and sit this morning i turned them all out and now look full again i must go there prince and scare them a bit it take a moment 
 yes go in and i will get myself a roll and some cheese said prince andrew who had not yet had time to eat anything 
 why you mention it prince i would have offered you something 
 they dismounted and entered the tent several officers with flushed and weary faces were sitting at the table eating and drinking 
 now what does this mean gentlemen said the staff officer in the reproachful tone of a man who has repeated the same thing more than once you know it do to leave your posts like this the prince gave orders that no one should leave his post now you captain and he turned to a thin dirty little artillery officer who without his boots he had given them to the canteen keeper to dry in only his stockings rose when they entered smiling not altogether comfortably 
 well you ashamed of yourself captain tushin he continued one would think that as an artillery officer you would set a good example yet here you are without your boots the alarm will be sounded and be in a pretty position without your boots the staff officer smiled kindly return to your posts gentlemen all of you all he added in a tone of command 
 prince andrew smiled involuntarily as he looked at the artillery officer tushin who silent and smiling shifting from one stockinged foot to the other glanced inquiringly with his large intelligent kindly eyes from prince andrew to the staff officer 
 the soldiers say it feels easier without boots said captain tushin smiling shyly in his uncomfortable position evidently wishing to adopt a jocular tone but before he had finished he felt that his jest was unacceptable and had not come off he grew confused 
 kindly return to your posts said the staff officer trying to preserve his gravity 
 prince andrew glanced again at the artillery small figure there was something peculiar about it quite unsoldierly rather comic but extremely attractive 
 the staff officer and prince andrew mounted their horses and rode on 
 having ridden beyond the village continually meeting and overtaking soldiers and officers of various regiments they saw on their left some entrenchments being thrown up the freshly dug clay of which showed up red several battalions of soldiers in their shirt sleeves despite the cold wind swarmed in these earthworks like a host of white ants spadefuls of red clay were continually being thrown up from behind the bank by unseen hands prince andrew and the officer rode up looked at the entrenchment and went on again just behind it they came upon some dozens of soldiers continually replaced by others who ran from the entrenchment they had to hold their noses and put their horses to a trot to escape from the poisoned atmosphere of these latrines 
 voila des camps monsieur le prince said the staff officer 
 this is a pleasure one gets in camp prince 
 they rode up the opposite hill from there the french could already be seen prince andrew stopped and began examining the position 
 our battery said the staff officer indicating the highest point in charge of the queer fellow we saw without his boots you can see everything from there go there prince 
 thank you very much i will go on alone said prince andrew wishing to rid himself of this staff company please trouble yourself further 
 the staff officer remained behind and prince andrew rode on alone 
 the farther forward and nearer the enemy he went the more orderly and cheerful were the troops the greatest disorder and depression had been in the baggage train he had passed that morning on the znaim road seven miles away from the french at grunth also some apprehension and alarm could be felt but the nearer prince andrew came to the french lines the more confident was the appearance of our troops the soldiers in their greatcoats were ranged in lines the sergeants major and company officers were counting the men poking the last man in each section in the ribs and telling him to hold his hand up soldiers scattered over the whole place were dragging logs and brushwood and were building shelters with merry chatter and laughter around the fires sat others dressed and undressed drying their shirts and leg bands or mending boots or overcoats and crowding round the boilers and porridge cookers in one company dinner was ready and the soldiers were gazing eagerly at the steaming boiler waiting till the sample which a quartermaster sergeant was carrying in a wooden bowl to an officer who sat on a log before his shelter had been tasted 
 another company a lucky one for not all the companies had vodka crowded round a sergeant major who tilting a keg filled one after another the canteen lids held out to him the soldiers lifted the canteen lids to their lips with reverential faces emptied them rolling the vodka in their mouths and walked away from the sergeant major with brightened expressions licking their lips and wiping them on the sleeves of their greatcoats all their faces were as serene as if all this were happening at home awaiting peaceful encampment and not within sight of the enemy before an action in which at least half of them would be left on the field after passing a chasseur regiment and in the lines of the kiev grenadiers fine fellows busy with similar peaceful affairs near the shelter of the regimental commander higher than and different from the others prince andrew came out in front of a platoon of grenadiers before whom lay a naked man two soldiers held him while two others were flourishing their switches and striking him regularly on his bare back the man shrieked unnaturally a stout major was pacing up and down the line and regardless of the screams kept repeating 
 a shame for a soldier to steal a soldier must be honest honorable and brave but if he robs his fellows there is no honor in him a scoundrel go on go on 
 so the swishing sound of the strokes and the desperate but unnatural screams continued 
 go on go on said the major 
 a young officer with a bewildered and pained expression on his face stepped away from the man and looked round inquiringly at the adjutant as he rode by 
 prince andrew having reached the front line rode along it our front line and that of the enemy were far apart on the right and left flanks but in the center where the men with a flag of truce had passed that morning the lines were so near together that the men could see one faces and speak to one another besides the soldiers who formed the picket line on either side there were many curious onlookers who jesting and laughing stared at their strange foreign enemies 
 since early morning despite an injunction not to approach the picket line the officers had been unable to keep away the soldiers forming the picket line like showmen exhibiting a curiosity no longer looked at the french but paid attention to the and grew weary waiting to be relieved prince andrew halted to have a look at the french 
 look look there one soldier was saying to another pointing to a russian musketeer who had gone up to the picket line with an officer and was rapidly and excitedly talking to a french grenadier hark to him jabbering fine it all the frenchy can do to keep up with him there now sidorov 
 wait a bit and listen fine answered sidorov who was considered an adept at french 
 the soldier to whom the laughers referred was dolokhov prince andrew recognized him and stopped to listen to what he was saying dolokhov had come from the left flank where their regiment was stationed with his captain 
 now then go on go on incited the officer bending forward and trying not to lose a word of the speech which was incomprehensible to him more please more he saying 
 dolokhov did not answer the captain he had been drawn into a hot dispute with the french grenadier they were naturally talking about the campaign the frenchman confusing the austrians with the russians was trying to prove that the russians had surrendered and had fled all the way from ulm while dolokhov maintained that the russians had not surrendered but had beaten the french 
 we have orders to drive you off here and we shall drive you off said dolokhov 
 only take care you and your cossacks are not all captured said the french grenadier 
 the french onlookers and listeners laughed 
 make you dance as we did under suvorov said dolokhov 
 on vous fera danser 
 qu chante asked a frenchman 
 he singing about 
 ancient history said another guessing that it referred to a former war the emperor will teach your suvara as he has taught the others 
 bonaparte began dolokhov but the frenchman interrupted him 
 not bonaparte he is the emperor sacre nom cried he angrily 
 the devil skin your emperor 
 and dolokhov swore at him in coarse russian and shouldering his musket walked away 
 let us go ivan lukich he said to the captain 
 ah the way to talk french said the picket soldiers now sidorov you have a try 
 sidorov turning to the french winked and began to jabber meaningless sounds very fast kari mala tafa safi muter kaska he said trying to give an expressive intonation to his voice 
 ho ho ho ha ha ha ha ouh ouh came peals of such healthy and laughter from the soldiers that it infected the french involuntarily so much so that the only thing left to do seemed to be to unload the muskets muskets explode the ammunition and all return home as quickly as possible 
 but the guns remained loaded the loopholes in blockhouses and entrenchments looked out just as menacingly and the unlimbered cannon confronted one another as before

 chapter 
 
 
 jo was alone in the twilight lying on the old sofa looking at the fire and thinking it was her favorite way of spending the hour of dusk no one disturbed her and she used to lie there on little red pillow planning stories dreaming dreams or thinking tender thoughts of the sister who never seemed far away her face looked tired grave and rather sad for tomorrow was her birthday and she was thinking how fast the years went by how old she was getting and how little she seemed to have accomplished almost and nothing to show for it jo was mistaken in that there was a good deal to show and she saw and was grateful for it 
 an old maid what to be a literary spinster with a pen for a spouse a family of stories for children and twenty years hence a morsel of fame perhaps when like poor johnson old and enjoy it solitary and share it independent and need it well i be a sour saint nor a selfish sinner and i dare say old maids are very comfortable when they get used to it but and there jo sighed as if the prospect was not inviting 
 it seldom is at first and thirty seems the end of all things to but not as bad as it looks and one can get on quite happily if one has something in self to fall back upon at girls begin to talk about being old maids but secretly resolve that they never will be at thirty they say nothing about it but quietly accept the fact and if sensible console themselves by remembering that they have twenty more useful happy years in which they may be learning to grow old gracefully laugh at the spinsters dear girls for often very tender tragic romances are hidden away in the hearts that beat so quietly under the sober gowns and many silent sacrifices of youth health ambition love itself make the faded faces beautiful in sight even the sad sour sisters should be kindly dealt with because they have missed the sweetest part of life if for no other reason and looking at them with compassion not contempt girls in their bloom should remember that they too may miss the blossom time that rosy cheeks last forever that silver threads will come in the bonnie brown hair and that kindness and respect will be as sweet as love and admiration now 
 gentlemen which means boys be courteous to the old maids no matter how poor and plain and prim for the only chivalry worth having is that which is the readiest to pay deference to the old protect the feeble and serve womankind regardless of rank age or color just recollect the good aunts who have not only lectured and fussed but nursed and petted too often without thanks the scrapes they have helped you out of the tips they have given you from their small store the stitches the patient old fingers have set for you the steps the willing old feet have taken and gratefully pay the dear old ladies the little attentions that women love to receive as long as they live the girls are quick to see such traits and will like you all the better for them and if death almost the only power that can part mother and son should rob you of yours you will be sure to find a tender welcome and maternal cherishing from some aunt priscilla who has kept the warmest corner of her lonely old heart for the best nevvy in the world 
 jo must have fallen asleep as i dare say my reader has during this little homily for suddenly ghost seemed to stand before her a substantial lifelike ghost leaning over her with the very look he used to wear when he felt a good deal and like to show it but like jenny in the ballad 
 
 
 she could not think it he 
 and lay staring up at him in startled silence till he stooped 
 and kissed her then she knew him and flew up crying joyfully 
 oh my teddy oh my teddy 
 dear jo you are glad to see me then 
 glad my blessed boy words express my gladness amy 
 your mother has got her down at we stopped there by the way and there was no getting my wife out of their clutches 
 your what cried jo for laurie uttered those two words with an unconscious pride and satisfaction which betrayed him 
 oh the dickens now done it and he looked so guilty that jo was down on him like a flash 
 gone and got married 
 yes please but i never will again and he went down upon his knees with a penitent clasping of hands and a face full of mischief mirth and triumph 
 actually married 
 very much so thank you 
 mercy on us what dreadful thing will you do next and jo fell into her seat with a gasp 
 a characteristic but not exactly complimentary congratulation returned laurie still in an abject attitude but beaming with satisfaction 
 what can you expect when you take breath away creeping in like a burglar and letting cats out of bags like that get up you ridiculous boy and tell me all about it 
 not a word unless you let me come in my old place and promise not to barricade 
 jo laughed at that as she had not done for many a long day and patted the sofa invitingly as she said in a cordial tone the old pillow is up garret and we need it now so come and fess teddy 
 how good it sounds to hear you say teddy no one ever calls me that but you and laurie sat down with an air of great content 
 what does amy call you 
 my lord 
 like her well you look it and eye plainly betrayed that she found her boy comelier than ever 
 the pillow was gone but there was a barricade nevertheless a natural one raised by time absence and change of heart both felt it and for a minute looked at one another as if that invisible barrier cast a little shadow over them it was gone directly however for laurie said with a vain attempt at dignity 
 i look like a married man and the head of a family not a bit and you never will grown bigger and bonnier but you are the same scapegrace as ever 
 now really jo you ought to treat me with more respect began laurie who enjoyed it all immensely 
 how can i when the mere idea of you married and settled is so irresistibly funny that i keep sober answered jo smiling all over her face so infectiously that they had another laugh and then settled down for a good talk quite in the pleasant old fashion 
 no use your going out in the cold to get amy for they are all coming up presently i wait i wanted to be the one to tell you the grand surprise and have first skim as we used to say when we squabbled about the cream 
 of course you did and spoiled your story by beginning at the wrong end now start right and tell me how it all happened pining to know 
 well i did it to please amy began laurie with a twinkle that made jo exclaim 
 fib number one amy did it to please you go on and tell the truth if you can sir 
 now beginning to marm it it jolly to hear her said laurie to the fire and the fire glowed and sparkled as if it quite agreed all the same you know she and i being one we planned to come home with the carrols a month or more ago but they suddenly changed their minds and decided to pass another winter in paris but grandpa wanted to come home he went to please me and i let him go along neither could i leave amy and mrs carrol had got english notions about chaperons and such nonsense and let amy come with us so i just settled the difficulty by saying be married and then we can do as we like 
 of course you did you always have things to suit you 
 not always and something in voice made jo say hastily 
 how did you ever get aunt to agree 
 it was hard work but between us we talked her over for we had heaps of good reasons on our side there time to write and ask leave but you all liked it had consented to it and it was only taking time by the fetlock as my wife says 
 we proud of those two word and we like to say them interrupted jo addressing the fire in her turn and watching with delight the happy light it seemed to kindle in the eyes that had been so tragically gloomy when she saw them last a trifle perhaps such a captivating little woman i help being proud of her well then uncle and aunt were there to play propriety we were so absorbed in one another we were of no mortal use apart and that charming arrangement woul make everything easy all round so we did it 
 when where how asked jo in a fever of feminine interest and curiosity for she could not realize it a particle 
 six weeks ago at the american in paris a very quiet wedding of course for even in our happiness we forget dear little beth 
 jo put her hand in his as he said that and laurie gently smoothed the little red pillow which he remembered well 
 why you let us know afterward asked jo in a quieter tone when they had sat quite still a minute 
 we wanted to surprise you we thought we were coming directly home at first but the dear old gentleman as soon as we were married found he be ready under a month at least and sent us off to spend our honeymoon wherever we liked amy had once called valrosa a regular honeymoon home so we went there and were as happy as people are but once in their lives my faith it love among the roses 
 laurie seemed to forget jo for a minute and jo was glad of it for the fact that he told her these things so freely and so naturally assured her that he had quite forgiven and forgotten she tried to draw away her hand but as if he guessed the thought that prompted the impulse laurie held it fast and said with a manly gravity she had never seen in him before 
 jo dear i want to say one thing and then put it by forever as i told you in my letter when i wrote that amy had been so kind to me i never shall stop loving you but the love is altered and i have learned to see that it is better as it is amy and you changed places in my heart all i think it was meant to be so and would have come about naturally if i had waited as you tried to make me but i never could be patient and so i got a heartache i was a boy then headstrong and violent and it took a hard lesson to show me my mistake for it was one jo as you said and i found it out after making a fool of myself upon my word i was so tumbled up in my mind at one time that i know which i loved best you or amy and tried to love you both alike but i and when i saw her in switzerland everything seemed to clear up all at once you both got into your right places and i felt sure that it was well off with the old love before it was on with the new that i could honestly share my heart between sister jo and wife amy and love them dearly will you believe it and go back to the happy old times when we first knew one another 
 believe it with all my heart but teddy we never can be boy and girl again the happy old times come back and we expect it we are man and woman now with sober work to do for playtime is over and we must give up frolicking sure you feel this i see the change in you and find it in me i shall miss my boy but i shall love the man as much and admire him more because he means to be what i hoped he would we be little playmates any longer but we will be brother and sister to love and help one another all our lives we laurie 
 he did not say a word but took the hand she offered him and laid his face down on it for a minute feeling that out of the grave of a boyish passion there had risen a beautiful strong friendship to bless them both presently jo said cheerfully for she the coming home to be a sad one i make it true that you children are really married and going to set up housekeeping why it seems only yesterday that i was buttoning pinafore and pulling your hair when you teased mercy me how time does fly 
 as one of the children is older than yourself you talk so like a grandma i flatter myself a gentleman growed as peggotty said of david and when you see amy find her rather a precocious infant said laurie looking amused at her maternal air 
 you may be a little older in years but ever so much older in feeling teddy women always are and this last year has been such a hard one that i feel forty 
 
 poor jo we left you to bear it alone while we went pleasuring you are older a line and another unless you smile your eyes look sad and when i touched the cushion just now i found a tear on it had a great deal to bear and had to bear it all alone what a selfish beast been and laurie pulled his own hair with a remorseful look 
 but jo only turned over the traitorous pillow and answered in a tone which she tried to make more cheerful no i had father and mother to help me and the dear babies to comfort me and the thought that you and amy were safe and happy to make the troubles here easier to bear i am lonely sometimes but i dare say good for me and 
 you never shall be again broke in laurie putting his arm about her as if to fence out every human ill amy and i get on without you so you must come and teach the children to keep house and go halves in everything just as we used to do and let us pet you and all be blissfully happy and friendly together 
 if i be in the way it would be very pleasant i begin to feel quite young already for somehow all my troubles seemed to fly away when you came you always were a comfort teddy and jo leaned her head on his shoulder just as she did years ago when beth lay ill and laurie told her to hold on to him 
 he looked down at her wondering if she remembered the time but jo was smiling to herself as if in truth her troubles had all vanished at his coming 
 you are the same jo still dropping tears about one minute and laughing the next you look a little wicked now what is it grandma 
 i was wondering how you and amy get on together 
 like angels 
 yes of course but which rules 
 i mind telling you that she does now at least i let her think so it pleases her you know we shall take turns for marriage they say halves rights and doubles duties 
 go on as you begin and amy will rule you all the days of your life 
 well she does it so imperceptibly that i think i shall mind much she is the sort of woman who knows how to rule well in fact i rather like it for she winds one round her finger as softly and prettily as a skein of silk and makes you feel as if she was doing you a favor all the while 
 that ever i should live to see you a henpecked husband and enjoying it cried jo with uplifted hands 
 it was good to see laurie square his shoulders and smile with masculine scorn at that insinuation as he replied with his high and mighty air amy is too for that and i am not the sort of man to submit to it my wife and i respect ourselves and one another too much ever to tyrannize or quarrel 
 jo like that and thought the new dignity very becoming but the boy seemed changing very fast into the man and regret mingled with her pleasure 
 i am sure of that amy and you never did quarrel as we used to she is the sun and i the wind in the fable and the sun managed the man best you remember 
 she can blow him up as well as shine on him laughed laurie such a lecture as i got at nice i give you my word it was a deal worse than any or your scoldings a regular rouser tell you all about it sometime she never will because after telling me that she despised and was ashamed of me she lost her heart to the despicable party and married the 
 what baseness well if she abuses you come to me and defend you 
 i look as if i needed it i said laurie getting up and striking an attitude which suddenly changed from the imposing to the rapturous as voice was heard calling where is she my dear old jo 
 in trooped the whole family and everyone was hugged and kissed all over again and after several vain attempts the three wanderers were set down to be looked at and exulted over mr laurence hale and hearty as ever was quite as much improved as the others by his foreign tour for the crustiness seemed to be early gone and the courtliness had received a polish which made it kindlier than ever it was good to see him beam at my children as he called the young pair it was better still to see amy pay him the daughterly duty and affection which completely won his old heart and best of all to watch laurie revolve about the two as if never tired of enjoying the pretty picture they made 
 the minute she put her eyes upon amy meg became conscious that her own dress a parisian air that young mrs mofffat would be entirely eclipsed by young mrs laurence and that her ladyship was altogether a most elegant and graceful woman jo thought as she watched the pair how well they look together i was right and laurie has found the beautiful accomplished girl who will become his home better than clumsy old jo and be a pride not a torment tohim mrs march and her husband smiled and nodded at each other with happy faces for they saw that their youngest had done well not only in worldly things but the better wealth of love confidence and happiness 
 for face was full of the soft brightness which betokens a peaceful heart her voice had a new tenderness in it and the cool prim carriage was changed to a gentle dignity both womanly and winning no little affectations marred it and the cordial sweetness of her manner was more charming than the new beauty or the old grace for it stamped her at once with the unmistakable sign of the true gentlewoman she had hoped to become 
 love has done much for our little girl said her mother softly 
 she has had a good example before her all her life my dear mr march whispered back with a loving look at the worn face and gray head beside him 
 daisy found it impossible to keep her eyes off her pitty aunty but attached herself like a lap dog to the wonderful chatelaine full of delightful charms demi paused to consider the new relationship before he compromised himself by the rash acceptance of a bribe which took the tempting form of a family of wooden bears from berne a flank movement produced an unconditional surrender however for laurie knew where to have him 
 young man when i first had the honor of making your acquaintance you hit me in the face now i demand the satisfaction of a gentleman and with that the tall uncle proceeded to toss and tousle the small nephew in a way that damaged his philosophical dignity as much as it delighted his boyish soul 
 blest if she in silk from head to foot it a relishin sight to see her settin there as fine as a fiddle anch a happy procession as filed away into the little dining room mr march proudly escorted mrs laurence mrs march as proudly leaned on the arm of my son the old gentleman took jo with a whispered you must be my girl now and a glance at the empty corner by thefire that made jo whisper back try to fill her place sir 
 the twins pranced behind feeling that the millennium was at hand for everyone was so busy with the newcomers that they were left to revel at their own sweet will and you may be sure they made the most of the opportunity they steal sips of tea stuff gingerbread ad libitum get a hot biscuit apiece and as a crowning trespass they each whisk a captivating little tart into their tiny pockets there to stick and crumble treacherously teaching them that both human nature and a pastry are frail burdened with the guilty consciousness of the sequestered tarts and fearing that sharp eyes would pierce the thin disguise of cambric and merino which hid their booty the little sinners attached themselves to dranpa who his spectacles on amy who was handed about like refreshments returned to the parlor on father arm the others paired off as before and this arrangement left jo companionless she did not mind it at the minute for she lingered to answer eager inquiry 
 will miss amy ride in her coop coupe and use all them lovely silver dishes stored away over yander 
 wonder if she drove six white horses ate off gold plate and wore diamonds and point lace every day teddy thinks nothing too good for her returned jo with infinite satisfaction 
 no more there is will you have hash or fishballs for breakfast asked hannah who wisely mingled poetry and prose 
 i care and jo shut the door feeling that food was an uncongenial topic just then she stood a minute looking at the party vanishing above and as short plaid legs toiled up the last stair a sudden sense of lonliness came over her so strongly that she looked about her with dim eyes as if to find something to lean upon for even teddy had deserted her if she had known what birthday gift was coming every minute nearer and nearer she would not have said to herself weep a little weep when i go to bed it do to be dismal now then she drew her hand over her eyes for one of her boyish habits was never to know where her handkerchief was and had just managed to call up a smile when there came a knock at the porch door 
 she opened with hospitable haste and started as if another ghost had come to surprise her for there stood a tall bearded gentleman beaming on her from the darkness like a midnight sun 
 oh mr bhaer i am so glad to see you cried jo with a clutch as if she feared the night would swallow him up before she could get him in 
 and i to see miss marsch but no you haf a party and the professor paused as the sound of voices and the tap of dancing feet came down to them 
 no we only the family my sister and friends have just come home and we are all very happy come in and make one of us 
 though a very social man i think mr bhaer would have gone decorously away and come again another day but how could he when jo shut the door behind him and bereft him of his hat perhaps her face had something to do with it for she forgot to hide her joy at seeing him and showed it with a frankness that proved irresistible to the solitary man whose welcome far exceeded his boldest hopes 
 if i shall not be monsieur de trop i will so gladly see them all you haf been ill my friend 
 he put the question abruptly for as jo hung up his coat the light fell on her face and he saw a change in it 
 not ill but tired and sorrowful we have had trouble since i saw you last 
 ah yes i know my heart was sore for you when i heard that and he shook hands again with such a sympathetic face that jo felt as if no comfort could equal the look of the kind eyes the grasp of the big warm hand 
 father mother this is my friend professor bhaer she said with a face and tone of such irrepressible pride and pleasure that she might as well have blown a trumpet and opened the door with a flourish 
 if the stranger had any doubts about his reception they were set at rest in a minute by the cordial welcome he received everyone greeted him kindly for sake at first but very soon they liked him for his own they could not help it for he carried the talisman that opens all hearts and these simple people warmed to him at once feeling even the more friendly because he was poor for poverty enriches those who live above it and is a sure passport to truly hospitable spirits mr bhaer sat looking about him with the air of a traveler who knocks at a strange door and when it opens finds himself at home the children went to him like bees to a honeypot and establishing themselves on each knee proceeded to captivate him by rifling his pockets pulling his beard and investigating his watch with juvenile audacity the women telegraphed their approval to one another and mr march feeling that he had got a kindred spirit opened his choicest stores for his benefit while silent john listened and enjoyed the talk but said not a word and mr laurence found it impossible to go to sleep 
 if jo had not been otherwise engaged behavior would have amused her for a faint twinge not of jealousy but something like suspicion caused that gentleman to stand aloof at first and observe the newcomer with brotherly circumspection but it did not last long he got interested in spite of himself and before he knew it was drawn into the circle for mr bhaer talked well in this genial atmosphere and did himself justice he seldom spoke to laurie but he looked at him often and a shadow would pass across his face as if regretting his own lost youth as he watched the young man in his prime then his eyes would turn to jo so wistfully that she would have surely answered the mute inquiry if she had seen it but jo had her own eyes to take care of and feeling that they could not be trusted she prudently kept them on the little sock she was knitting like a model maiden aunt 
 a stealthy glance now and then refreshed her like sips of fresh water after a dusty walk for the sidelong peeps showed her several propitious omens mr face had lost the expression and looked all alive with interest in the present moment actually young and handsome she thought forgetting to compare him with laurie as she usually did strange men to their great detriment then he seemed quite inspired though the burial customs of the ancients to which the conversation had strayed might not be considered an exhilarating topic jo quite glowed with triumph when teddy got quenched in an argument and thought to herself as she watched her absorbed face how he would enjoy having such a man as my professor to talk with every day lastly mr bhaer was dressed in a new suit of black which made him look more like a gentleman than ever his bushy hair had been cut and smoothly brushed but stay in order long for in exciting moments he rumpled it up in the droll way he used to do and jo liked it rampantly erect better than flat because she thought it gave his fine forehead a aspect poor jo how she did glorify that plain man as she sat knitting away so quietly yet letting nothing escape her not even the fact that mr bhaer actually had gold in his immaculate wristbands 
 dear old fellow he have got himself up with more care if been going said jo to herself and then a sudden thought born of the words made her blush so dreadfully that she had to drop her ball and go down after it to hide her face 
 the maneuver did not succeed as well as she expected however for though just in the act of setting fire to a funeral pyre the professor dropped his torch metaphorically speaking and made a dive after the little blue ball of course they bumped their heads smartly together saw stars and both came up flushed and laughing without the ball to resume their seats wishing they had not left them 
 nobody knew where the evening went to for hannah skillfully abstracted the babies at an early hour nodding like two rosy poppies and mr laurence went home to rest the others sat round the fire talking away utterly regardless of the lapse of time till meg whose maternal was impressed with a firm conviction that daisy had tumbled out of be and demi set his nightgown afire studying the structure of matches made a move to go 
 we must have our sing in the good old way for we are all together again once more said jo feeling that a good shout would be a safe and pleasant vent for the jubilant emotions of her soul 
 they were not all there but no one found the words thougtless or untrue for beth still seemed among them a peaceful presence invisible but dearer than ever since death could not break the household league that love made disoluble the little chair stood in its old place the tidy basket with the bit of work she left unfinished when the needle grew so heavy was still on its accustomed shelf the beloved instrument seldom touched now had not been moved and above it face serene and smiling as in the early days looked down upon them seeming to say be happy i am here 
 play something amy let them hear how much you have improved said laurie with pardonable pride in his promising pupil 
 but amy whispered with full eyes as she twirled the faded stool not tonight dear i show off tonight 
 but she did show something better than brilliancy or skill for she sang songs with a tender music in her voice which the best master could not have taught and touched the hearts with a sweeter power than any other inspiration could have given her the room was very still when the clear voice failed suddenly at the last line of favorite hymn it was hard to say 
 earth hath no sorrow that heaven cannot heal 
 and amy leaned against her husband who stood behind her feeling that her welcome home was not quite perfect without kiss 
 now we must finish with song for mr bhaer sings that said jo before the pause grew painful and mr bhaer cleared his throat with a gratified hem as he stepped into the corner where jo stood saying 
 you will sing with me we go excellently well together 
 a pleasing fiction by the way for jo had no more idea of 
 music than a grasshopper but she would have consented if he had 
 proposed to sing a whole opera and warbled away blissfully regardless 
 of time and tune it much matter for mr bhaer 
 sang like a true german heartily and well and jo soon subsided 
 into a subdued hum that she might listen to the mellow voice that 
 seemed to sing for her alone 
 thou the land where the citron blooms 
 used to be the favorite line for das land meant germany to him but now he seemed to dwell with peculiar warmth and melody upon the words 
 
 there oh there might i with thee o my beloved go and one listener was so thrilled by the tender invitation that she longed to say she did know the land and would joyfully depart thither whenever he liked the song was considered a great success and the singer retired covered with laurels but a few minutes afterward he forgot his manners entirely and stared at amy putting on her bonnet for she had been introduced simply as my sister and on one had called her by her new name since her came he forgot himself still further when laurie said in his most gracious manner at parting 
 my wife and i are very glad to meet you sir please remember that there is always a welcome waiting for you over the way 
 then the professor thanked him so heartily and looked so suddenly illuminated with satisfaction that laurie thought him the most delightfully demonstrative old fellow he ever met 
 i too shall go but i shall gladly come again if you will gif me leave dear madame for a little business in the city will keep me here some days 
 he spoke to mrs march but he looked at jo and the voice gave as cordial an assent as did the eyes for mrs march was not so blind to her interest as mrs moffat supposed 
 i suspect that is a wise man remarked mr march with placid satisfaction from the hearthrug after the last guest had gone 
 i know he is a good one added mrs march with decided approval as she wound up the clock 
 i thought like him was all jo said as she slipped away to her bed 
 she wondered what the business was that brought mr bhaer to the city and finally decided that he had been appointed to some great honor somewhere but had been too modest to mention the fact if she had seen his face when safe in his own room he looked at the picture of a severe and rigid young lady with a good deal of hair who appeared to be gazing darkly into futurity it might have thrown some light upon the subject especially when he turned off the gas and kissed the picture in the dark

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the daisy 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 now listen in the country close by the high road stood a 
 farmhouse perhaps you have passed by and seen it yourself there 
 was a little flower garden with painted wooden palings in front of it 
 close by was a ditch on its fresh green bank grew a little daisy the 
 sun shone as warmly and brightly upon it as on the magnificent 
 garden flowers and therefore it thrived well one morning it had 
 quite opened and its little petals stood round the 
 yellow centre like the rays of the sun it did not mind that nobody 
 saw it in the grass and that it was a poor despised flower on the 
 contrary it was quite happy and turned towards the sun looking 
 upward and listening to the song of the lark high up in the air 
 
 the little daisy was as happy as if the day had been a great 
 holiday but it was only monday all the children were at school 
 and while they were sitting on the forms and learning their lessons 
 it sat on its thin green stalk and learnt from the sun and from its 
 surroundings how kind god is and it rejoiced that the song of the 
 little lark expressed so sweetly and distinctly its own feelings with 
 a sort of reverence the daisy looked up to the bird that could fly and 
 sing but it did not feel envious i can see and hear it thought 
 the sun shines upon me and the forest kisses me how rich i am 
 in the garden close by grew many large and magnificent flowers 
 and strange to say the less fragrance they had the haughtier and 
 prouder they were the peonies puffed themselves up in order to be 
 larger than the roses but size is not everything the tulips had 
 the finest colours and they knew it well too for they were standing 
 bolt upright like candles that one might see them the better in 
 their pride they did not see the little daisy which looked over to 
 them and thought how rich and beautiful they are i am sure the 
 pretty bird will fly down and call upon them thank god that i 
 stand so near and can at least see all the splendour and while the 
 daisy was still thinking the lark came flying down crying tweet 
 but not to the peonies and tulips no into the grass to the poor 
 daisy its joy was so great that it did not know what to think the 
 little bird hopped round it and sang how beautifully soft the 
 grass is and what a lovely little flower with its golden heart and 
 silver dress is growing here the yellow centre in the daisy did 
 indeed look like gold while the little petals shone as brightly as 
 silver 
 
 how happy the daisy was no one has the least idea the bird 
 kissed it with its beak sang to it and then rose again up to the 
 blue sky it was certainly more than a quarter of an hour before the 
 daisy recovered its senses half ashamed yet glad at heart it looked 
 over to the other flowers in the garden surely they had witnessed its 
 pleasure and the honour that had been done to it they understood 
 its joy but the tulips stood more stiffly than ever their faces were 
 pointed and red because they were vexed the peonies were sulky it 
 was well that they could not speak otherwise they would have given 
 the daisy a good lecture the little flower could very well see that 
 they were ill at ease and pitied them sincerely 
 
 shortly after this a girl came into the garden with a large sharp 
 knife she went to the tulips and began cutting them off one after 
 another ugh sighed the daisy that is terrible now they are done 
 for 
 
 the girl carried the tulips away the daisy was glad that it was 
 outside and only a small flower it felt very grateful at sunset 
 it folded its petals and fell asleep and dreamt all night of the sun 
 and the little bird 
 
 on the following morning when the flower once more stretched 
 forth its tender petals like little arms towards the air and 
 light the daisy recognised the voice but what it sang sounded 
 so sad indeed the poor bird had good reason to be sad for it had 
 been caught and put into a cage close by the open window it sang of 
 the happy days when it could merrily fly about of fresh green corn in 
 the fields and of the time when it could soar almost up to the 
 clouds the poor lark was most unhappy as a prisoner in a cage the 
 little daisy would have liked so much to help it but what could be 
 done indeed that was very difficult for such a small flower to 
 find out it entirely forgot how beautiful everything around it was 
 how warmly the sun was shining and how splendidly white its own 
 petals were it could only think of the poor captive bird for which 
 it could do nothing then two little boys came out of the garden 
 one of them had a large sharp knife like that with which the girl had 
 cut the tulips they came straight towards the little daisy which 
 could not understand what they wanted 
 
 here is a fine piece of turf for the lark said one of the boys 
 and began to cut out a square round the daisy so that it remained 
 in the centre of the grass 
 
 pluck the flower off said the other boy and the daisy 
 trembled for fear for to be pulled off meant death to it and it 
 wished so much to live as it was to go with the square of turf into 
 the poor captive cage 
 
 no let it stay said the other boy it looks so pretty 
 
 and so it stayed and was brought into the cage the poor 
 bird was lamenting its lost liberty and beating its wings against the 
 wires and the little daisy could not speak or utter a consoling word 
 much as it would have liked to do so so the forenoon passed 
 i have no water said the captive lark they have all gone out 
 and forgotten to give me anything to drink my throat is dry and 
 burning i feel as if i had fire and ice within me and the air is 
 so oppressive alas i must die and part with the warm sunshine 
 the fresh green meadows and all the beauty that god has created 
 and it thrust its beak into the piece of grass to refresh itself a 
 little then it noticed the little daisy and nodded to it and kissed 
 it with its beak and said you must also fade in here poor little 
 flower you and the piece of grass are all they have given me in 
 exchange for the whole world which i enjoyed outside each little 
 blade of grass shall be a green tree for me each of your white petals 
 a fragrant flower alas you only remind me of what i have lost 
 i wish i could console the poor lark thought the daisy it 
 could not move one of its leaves but the fragrance of its delicate 
 petals streamed forth and was much stronger than such flowers usually have the bird noticed it although it was dying with thirst and in its pain tore up the green blades of grass but did not touch the 
 flower 
 
 the evening came and nobody appeared to bring the poor bird a 
 drop of water it opened its beautiful wings and fluttered about in 
 its anguish a faint and mournful tweet tweet was all it could 
 utter then it bent its little head towards the flower and its 
 heart broke for want and longing the flower could not as on the 
 previous evening fold up its petals and sleep it dropped 
 sorrowfully the boys only came the next morning when they saw the dead bird they began to cry bitterly dug a nice grave for it and 
 adorned it with flowers the body was placed in a pretty red 
 box they wished to bury it with royal honours while it was alive and 
 sang they forgot it and let it suffer want in the cage now they 
 cried over it and covered it with flowers the piece of turf with the 
 little daisy in it was thrown out on the dusty highway nobody 
 thought of the flower which had felt so much for the bird and had so 
 greatly desired to comfort it

 of deformity 
 deformed persons are commonly even with nature for as nature hath done ill by them so do they by nature being for the most part as die scripture saith void of natural affection and so they have their revenge of nature certainly there is a consent between the body and the mind and where nature erreth in the one she ventureth in the other but because there is in man an election touching the frame of his mind and a necessity in the frame of his body the stars of natural inclination are sometimes obscured by the sun of discipline and virtue 
 
 therefore it is good to consider of deformity not as a sign which is more deceivable but as a cause which seldom failed of the effect whosoever hath anything fixed in his person thafdoth induce contempt hath also a perpetual spur in himself to rescue and deliver himself from scorn therefore all deformed persons are extreme bold 
 first as in their own defence as being exposed to scorn but in process of time by a general habit also it stirreth in hem industry and especially of this kind to watch and observe the weakness of others that they may have somewhat to repay 
 again in their superiors it quencheth jealousy towards them as persons that they mink they may at pleasure despise and it layeth their competitors and emulators asleep as never believing they should be in possibility of advancement till they see them in possession so that upon the matter in a great wit deformity is an advantage to rising kings in ancient times and at this present in some countries were wont to put great trust in eunuchs because they that are envious towards all are more obnoxious and officious towards one but yet their trust towards them hath rather been as to good spials and good whisperers man good magistrates and officers 
 and much like is the reason of deformed persons still the ground is they will if they be of spirit seek to free themselves from scorn which must be either by virtue or malice and therefore let it not be marvelled if sometimes they prove excellent persons as was agesilaus zanger the son of solyman aesop gasca president of peru and socrates may go likewise amongst them with others

 chapter iv 
 
 m madeleine in mourning 
 at the beginning of the newspapers announced the death of m myriel bishop of d surnamed monseigneur bienvenu who had died in the odor of sanctity at the age of 
 the bishop of d to supply here a detail which the papers omitted had been blind for many years before his death and content to be blind as his sister was beside him 
 let us remark by the way that to be blind and to be loved is in fact one of the most strangely exquisite forms of happiness upon this earth where nothing is complete 
 to have continually at side a woman a daughter a sister a charming being who is there because you need her and because she cannot do without you to know that we are indispensable to a person who is necessary to us to be able to incessantly measure affection by the amount of her presence which she bestows on us and to say to ourselves since she consecrates the whole of her time to me it is because i possess the whole of her heart to behold her thought in lieu of her face to be able to verify the fidelity of one being amid the eclipse of the world to regard the rustle of a gown as the sound of wings to hear her come and go retire speak return sing and to think that one is the centre of these steps of this speech to manifest at each instant personal attraction to feel self all the more powerful because of infirmity to become in obscurity and through obscurity the star around which this angel felicities equal this the supreme happiness of life consists in the conviction that one is loved loved for own us say rather loved in spite of self this conviction the blind man possesses to be served in distress is to be caressed 
 does he lack anything no one does not lose the sight when one has love 
 and what love a love wholly constituted of virtue 
 there is no blindness where there is certainty 
 soul seeks soul gropingly and finds it and this soul found and tested is a woman 
 a hand sustains you it is hers 
 a mouth lightly touches your brow it is her mouth you hear a breath very near you it is hers 
 to have everything of her from her worship to her pity never to be left to have that sweet weakness aiding you to lean upon that immovable reed to touch providence with hands and to be able to take it in made bliss 
 the heart that obscure celestial flower undergoes a mysterious blossoming one would not exchange that shadow for all brightness the angel soul is there uninterruptedly there if she departs it is but to return again she vanishes like a dream and reappears like reality 
 one feels warmth approaching and behold she is there one overflows with serenity with gayety with ecstasy one is a radiance amid the night 
 and there are a thousand little cares nothings which are enormous in that void 
 the most ineffable accents of the feminine voice employed to lull you and supplying the vanished universe to you 
 one is caressed with the soul one sees nothing but one feels that one is adored 
 it is a paradise of shadows 
 it was from this paradise that monseigneur welcome had passed to the other 
 the announcement of his death was reprinted by the local journal of m sur m on the following day m madeleine appeared clad wholly in black and with crape on his hat 
 this mourning was noticed in the town and commented on 
 it seemed to throw a light on m origin 
 it was concluded that some relationship existed between him and the venerable bishop 
 he has gone into mourning for the bishop of d said the this raised m credit greatly and procured for him instantly and at one blow a certain consideration in the noble world of m sur m the microscopic faubourg of the place meditated raising the quarantine against m madeleine the probable relative of a bishop 
 m madeleine perceived the advancement which he had obtained by the more numerous courtesies of the old women and the more plentiful smiles of the young ones one evening a ruler in that petty great world who was curious by right of seniority ventured to ask him m le maire is doubtless a cousin of the late bishop of d 
 he said no madame 
 but resumed the dowager you are wearing mourning for him 
 he replied it is because i was a servant in his family in my youth 
 another thing which was remarked was that every time that he encountered in the town a young savoyard who was roaming about the country and seeking chimneys to sweep the mayor had him summoned inquired his name and gave him money 
 the little savoyards told each other about it 
 a great many of them passed that way

 having ridden round the whole line from right flank to left prince andrew made his way up to the battery from which the staff officer had told him the whole field could be seen here he dismounted and stopped beside the farthest of the four unlimbered cannon before the guns an artillery sentry was pacing up and down he stood at attention when the officer arrived but at a sign resumed his measured monotonous pacing behind the guns were their limbers and still farther back picket ropes and bonfires to the left not far from the farthest cannon was a small newly constructed wattle shed from which came the sound of officers voices in eager conversation 
 it was true that a view over nearly the whole russian position and the greater part of the opened out from this battery just facing it on the crest of the opposite hill the village of schon grabern could be seen and in three places to left and right the french troops amid the smoke of their campfires the greater part of whom were evidently in the village itself and behind the hill to the left from that village amid the smoke was something resembling a battery but it was impossible to see it clearly with the naked eye our right flank was posted on a rather steep incline which dominated the french position our infantry were stationed there and at the farthest point the dragoons in the center where battery stood and from which prince andrew was surveying the position was the easiest and most direct descent and ascent to the brook separating us from schon grabern on the left our troops were close to a copse in which smoked the bonfires of our infantry who were felling wood the french line was wider than ours and it was plain that they could easily outflank us on both sides behind our position was a steep and deep dip making it difficult for artillery and cavalry to retire prince andrew took out his notebook and leaning on the cannon sketched a plan of the position he made some notes on two points intending to mention them to bagration his idea was first to concentrate all the artillery in the center and secondly to withdraw the cavalry to the other side of the dip prince andrew being always near the commander in chief closely following the mass movements and general orders and constantly studying historical accounts of battles involuntarily pictured to himself the course of events in the forthcoming action in broad outline he imagined only important possibilities if the enemy attacks the right flank he said to himself the kiev grenadiers and the podolsk chasseurs must hold their position till reserves from the center come up in that case the dragoons could successfully make a flank counterattack if they attack our center we having the center battery on this high ground shall withdraw the left flank under its cover and retreat to the dip by echelons so he reasoned all the time he had been beside the gun he had heard the voices of the officers distinctly but as often happens had not understood a word of what they were saying suddenly however he was struck by a voice coming from the shed and its tone was so sincere that he could not but listen 
 no friend said a pleasant and as it seemed to prince andrew a familiar voice what i say is that if it were possible to know what is beyond death none of us would be afraid of it so friend 
 another a younger voice interrupted him afraid or not you escape it anyhow 
 all the same one is afraid oh you clever people said a third manly voice interrupting them both of course you artillery men are very wise because you can take everything along with you vodka and snacks 
 and the owner of the manly voice evidently an infantry officer laughed 
 yes one is afraid continued the first speaker he of the familiar voice one is afraid of the unknown what it is whatever we may say about the soul going to the sky we know there is no sky but only an atmosphere 
 the manly voice again interrupted the artillery officer 
 well stand us some of your herb vodka tushin it said 
 why thought prince andrew the captain who stood up in the hut without his boots he recognized the agreeable philosophizing voice with pleasure 
 some herb vodka certainly said tushin but still to conceive a future life 
 he did not finish just then there was a whistle in the air nearer and nearer faster and louder louder and faster a cannon ball as if it had not finished saying what was necessary thudded into the ground near the shed with super human force throwing up a mass of earth the ground seemed to groan at the terrible impact 
 and immediately tushin with a short pipe in the corner of his mouth and his kind intelligent face rather pale rushed out of the shed followed by the owner of the manly voice a dashing infantry officer who hurried off to his company buttoning up his coat as he ran

 chapter 
 
 
 please madam mother could you lend me my wife for half an hour the luggage has come and been making hay of paris finery trying to find some things i want said laurie coming in the next day to find mrs laurence sitting in her lap as if being made the baby again 
 certainly go dear i forgot that you have any home but this and mrs march pressed the white hand that wore the wedding ring as if asking pardon for her maternal covetousness 
 i have come over if i could have helped it but i get on without my little woman any more than a 
 weathercock can without the wind suggested jo as he paused for a simile jo had grown quite her own saucy self again since teddy came home 
 exactly for amy keeps me pointing due west most of the time with only an occasional whiffle round to the south and i had an easterly spell since i was married know anything about the north but am altogether salubrious and balmy hey my lady 
 lovely weather so far i know how long it will last but not afraid of storms for learning how to sail my ship come home dear and find your bootjack i suppose what you are rummaging after among my things men are so helpless mother said amy with a matronly air which delighted her husband 
 what are you going to do with yourselves after you get settled asked jo buttoning cloak as she used to button her pinafores 
 we have our plans we mean to say much about them yet because we are such very new brooms but we intend to be idle going into business with a devotion that shall delight grandfather and prove to him that not spoiled i need something of the sort to keep me steady tired of dawdling and mean to work like a man 
 and amy what is she going to do asked mrs march well pleased at decision and the energy with which he spoke 
 after doing the civil all round and airing our best bonnet we shall astonish you by the elegant hospitalities of our mansion the brilliant society we shall draw about us and the beneficial influence we shall exert over the world at large about it it madame recamier asked laurie with a quizzical look at amy 
 time will show come away impertinence and shock my family by calling me names before their faces answered amy resolving that there should be a home with a good wife in it before she set up a salon as a queen of society 
 how happy those children seem together observed mr march finding it difficult to become absorbed in his aristotle after the young couple had gone 
 yes and i think it will last added mrs march with the restful expression of a pilot who has brought a ship safely into port 
 i know it will happy amy and jo sighed then smiled brightly as professor bhaer opened the gate with an impatient push 
 later in the evening when his mind had been set at rest about the bootjack laurie said suddenly to his wife mrs laurence 
 my lord 
 that man intends to marry our jo 
 i hope so you dear 
 well my love i consider him a trump in the fullest sense of that expressive word but i do wish he was a little younger and a good deal richer 
 now laurie be too fastidious and if they love one another it matter a particle how old they are nor how poor women never should marry for money amy caught herself up short as the words escaped her and looked at her husband who replied with malicious gravity 
 certainly not though you do hear charming girls say that they intend to do it sometimes if my memory serves me you once thought it your duty to make a rich match that accounts perhaps for your marrying a like me 
 oh my dearest boy say that i forgot you were rich when i said yes have married you if you a penny and i sometimes wish you were poor that i might show how much i love you and amy who was very dignified in public and very fond in private gave convincing proofs of the truth of her words 
 you really think i am such a mercenary creature as i tried to be once do you it would break my heart if you believe that gladly pull in the same boat with you even if you had to get your living by rowing on the lake 
 am i an idiot and a brute how could i think so when you refused a richer man for me and let me give you half i want to now when i have the right girls do it every day poor things and are taught to think it is their only salvation but you had better lessons and though i trembled for you at one time i was not disappointed for the daughter was true to the teaching i told mamma so yesterday and she looked as glad and grateful as if given her a check for a million to be spent in charity you are not listening to my moral remarks mrs laurence and laurie paused for eyes had an absent look though fixed upon his face 
 yes i am and admiring the mple in your chin at the same time i wish to make you vain but i must confess that prouder of my handsome husband than of all his money laugh but your nose is such a comfort to me and amy softly caressed the feature with artistic satisfaction 
 laurie had received many compliments in his life but never one that suited him better as he plainly showed though he did laugh at his peculiar taste while she said slowly may i ask you a question dear 
 of course you may 
 shall you care if jo does marry mr bhaer 
 oh the trouble is it i thought there was something in the dimple that quite suit you not being a dog in the manger but the happiest fellow alive i assure you i can dance at wedding with a heart as light as my heels do you doubt it my darling 
 amy looked up at him and was satisfied her little jealous fear vanished forever and she thanked him with a face full of love and confidence 
 i wish we could do something for that capital old professor we invent a rich relation who shall obligingly die out there in germany and leave him a tidy little fortune said laurie when they began to pace up and down the long drawing room arm in arm as they were fond of doing in memory of the chateau garden 
 jo would find us out and spoil it all she is very proud of him just as he is and said yesterday that she thought poverty was a beautiful thing 
 bless her dear heart she think so when she has a literary husband and a dozen little professors and professorins to support we interfere now but watch our chance and do them a good turn in spite of themselves i owe jo for a part of my education and she believes in paying their honest debts so get round her in that way 
 how delightful it is to be able to help others it that was always one of my dreams to have the power of giving freely and thanks to you the dream has come true 
 ah do quantities of good we one sort of poverty that i particularly like to help beggars get taken care of but poor gentle folks fare badly because they ask and people dare to offer charity yet there are a thousand ways of helping them if one only knows how to do it so delicately that it does not offend i must say i like to serve a decayed gentleman better than a blarnerying beggar i suppose wrong but i do though it is harder 
 because it takes a gentleman to do it added the other member of the domestic admiration society 
 thank you afraid i deserve that pretty compliment but i was going to say that while i was dawdling about abroad i saw a good many talented young fellows making all sorts of sacrifices and enduring real hardships that they might realize their dreams splendid fellows some of them working like heros poor and friendless but so full of courage patience and ambition that i was ashamed of myself and longed to give them a right good lift those are people whom a satisfaction to help for if got genius an honor to be allowed to serve them and not let it be lost or delayed for want of fuel to keep the pot boiling if they a pleasure to comfort the poor souls and keep them from despair when they find it out 
 yes indeed and another class who ask and who suffer in silence i know something of it for i belonged to it before you made a princess of me as the king does the beggarmaid in the old story ambitious girls have a hard time laurie and often have to see youth health and precious opportunities go by just for want of a little help at the right minute people have been very kind to me and whenever i see girls struggling along as we used to do i want to put out my hand and help them as i was helped 
 and so you shall like an angel as you are cried laurie resolving with a glow of philanthropic zeal to found and endow an institution for the express benefit of young women with artistic tendencies rich people have no right to sit down and enjoy themselves or let their money accumulate for others to waste not half so sensible to leave legacies when one dies as it is to use the money wisely while alive and enjoy making fellow creatures happy with it have a good time ourselves and add an extra relish to our own pleasure by giving other people a generous taste will you be a little dorcal going about emptying a big basket of comforts and filling it up with good deeds 
 with all my heart if you will be a brave st martin stopping as you ride gallantly through the world to share your cloak with the beggar 
 a bargain and we shall get the best of it 
 so the young pair shook hands upon it and then paced happily on again feeling that their pleasant home was more homelike because they hoped to brighten other homes believing that their own feet would walk more uprightly along the flowery path before them if they smoothed rough ways for other feet and feeling that their hearts were more closely knit together by a love which could tenderly remember those less blest than they

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 there was once a who thought herself so fine that 
 she fancied she must be fit for embroidery hold me tight she would say to the fingers when they took her up let me fall if 
 you do i shall never be found again i am so very fine 
 
 that is your opinion is it said the fingers as they seized 
 her round the body 
 
 see i am coming with a train said the 
 drawing a long thread after her but there was no knot in the thread 
 the fingers then placed the point of the needle against the 
 slipper there was a crack in the upper leather which had to be 
 sewn together 
 
 what coarse work said the i shall never get 
 through i shall break i am breaking and sure enough she broke 
 
 did i not say so said the i know i am too fine for 
 such work as that 
 
 this needle is quite useless for sewing now said the fingers 
 but they still held it fast and the cook dropped some 
 on the needle and fastened her handkerchief with it in front 
 
 so now i am a said the i knew 
 very well i should come to honor some day merit is sure to rise and 
 she laughed quietly to herself for of course no one ever saw a 
 laugh and there she sat as proudly as if she were in a 
 state coach and looked all around her may i be allowed to ask if 
 you are made of gold she inquired of her neighbor a pin you 
 have a very pretty appearance and a curious head although you are 
 rather small you must take pains to grow for it is not every one who 
 has dropped upon him and as she spoke the 
 drew herself up so proudly that she fell out of the 
 handkerchief right into the sink which the cook was cleaning now 
 i am going on a journey said the needle as she floated away with 
 the dirty water i do hope i shall not be lost but she really was 
 lost in a gutter i am too fine for this world said the 
 as she lay in the gutter but i know who i am and 
 that is always some comfort so the kept up her 
 proud behavior and did not lose her good humor then there floated 
 over her all sorts of things chips and straws and pieces of old 
 newspaper see how they sail said the they do 
 not know what is under them i am here and here i shall stick see 
 there goes a chip thinking of nothing in the world but himself 
 only a chip a straw going by now how he turns and twists 
 about be thinking too much of yourself or you may chance to 
 run against a stone there swims a piece of newspaper what is written upon it has been forgotten long ago and yet it gives itself airs i sit here patiently and quietly i know who i am so i shall not move 
 
 one day something lying close to the glittered so 
 splendidly that she thought it was a diamond yet it was only a 
 piece of broken bottle the spoke to it because it 
 sparkled and represented herself as a i suppose you 
 are really a diamond she said 
 
 why yes something of the kind he replied and so each believed 
 the other to be very valuable and then they began to talk about the 
 world and the conceited people in it 
 
 i have been in a said the 
 and this lady was the cook she had on each hand five fingers and 
 anything so conceited as these five fingers i have never seen and yet 
 they were only employed to take me out of the box and to put me back again 
 
 were they not 
 
 said the no indeed but so 
 haughty they were five brothers all born fingers they kept very 
 proudly together though they were of different lengths the one who 
 stood first in the rank was named the thumb he was short and thick 
 and had only one joint in his back and could therefore make but one 
 bow but he said that if he were cut off from a hand that man 
 would be unfit for a soldier his neighbor dipped 
 himself into sweet or sour pointed to the sun and moon and formed 
 the letters when the fingers wrote longman the middle finger looked 
 over the heads of all the others the next finger wore a 
 golden circle round his waist and little playman did nothing at 
 all and seemed proud of it they were boasters and boasters they 
 will remain and therefore i left them 
 
 and now we sit here and glitter said the piece of broken bottle 
 
 at the same moment more water streamed into the gutter so that it 
 overflowed and the piece of bottle was carried away 
 
 so he is promoted said the while i remain 
 here i am too fine but that is my pride and what do i care and so 
 she sat there in her pride and had many such thoughts as these i 
 could almost fancy that i came from a sunbeam i am so fine it 
 seems as if the sunbeams were always looking for me under the water 
 
 ah i am so fine that even my mother cannot find me had i still my 
 old eye which was broken off i believe i should weep but no i 
 would not do that it is not genteel to cry 
 
 one day a couple of street boys were paddling in the gutter for 
 they sometimes found old nails farthings and other treasures it was 
 dirty work but they took great pleasure in it hallo cried one as 
 he pricked himself with the a fellow for you 
 i am not a fellow i am a young lady said the 
 but no one heard her 
 
 the had come off and she was quite black but black 
 makes a person look slender so she thought herself even finer than 
 before 
 
 here comes an sailing along said one of the boys 
 so they stuck the into the 
 
 white walls and i am black myself said the 
 that looks well now i can be seen but i hope i shall not be 
 or i shall break again she was not and she did 
 not break it is a good thing against to have a steel 
 stomach and not to forget own importance now my has past delicate people can bear a great deal 
 
 crack went the as a waggon passed over it good 
 heavens how it crushes said the i shall be sick 
 now i am breaking but she did not break though the waggon went 
 over her as she lay at full length and there let her lie

 of building 
 houses are built to live in and not to look on therefore let use be preferred before 
 uniformity except where both may be had leave the goodly fabrics of houses for 
 beauty only to the enchanted palaces of the poets who build them wilh small cost 
 he that builds a fair house upon an ill seat committeth himself to prison neither 
 do i reckon it an ill seat only where the air is unwholesome but likewise where the 
 air is unequal as you shall see many fine seats set upon a knap of ground environed with higher hills round about it whereby the heat of the sun is pent in and the wind gathereth as in troubles so as you shall have and that suddenly as great diversity of heat and cold as if you dwelt in several places neither is it ill air 
 only that maketh an ill seat but ill ways ill markets and if you will consult 
 with momus ill neighbours 
 i speak not of many more want of water want of wood shade and shelter want of fruitfulness and mixture of grounds of several natures want of prospect want of level grounds want of places at some near distance for sports of hunting hawking and races too near the sea too remote having the commodity of navigable rivers or the discommodity of their overflowing too far off from great cities which may hinder business or too near them which lurcheth all provisions and maketh every thing dear where a man hath a great living laid together and where he is scanted all which as it is impossible perhaps to find together so it is good to know them and think of them that a man may take as many as he can and if he have several dwellings that he sort them so that what he wanteth in the one he may find in the other lucullus answered pompey well who when he saw his stately galleries and rooms so large and lightsome in one of his houses said 
 
 surely an excellent place for summer but how do you in winter 
 lucullus answered why do you not think me as wise as some fowl are that ever change their abode towards the winter 
 
 to pass from the seat to the house itself we will do as cicero doth in the art who writes books de oratore and a book he entitles orator whereof the former delivers the precepts of the art and the latter the perfection we will therefore describe a princely palace making a brief model thereof for it is strange to see now in europe such huge buildings as the vatican and escurial and some others be and yet scarce a very fair room in them 
 
 first therefore i say you cannot have a perfect palace except you have two several sides a side for me banquet as is spoken of in the book of hester and a side for the household the one for feasts and triumphs and the other for dwelling 
 i understand both these sides to be not only returns but parts of the front and to 
 be uniform without though severally partitioned within and to be on both sides of 
 a great and stately tower in the midst of the front that as it were joinefh them 
 together on either hand i would have on the side of the banquet in front one only 
 goodly room above stairs of some forty foot high and under it a room for a dressing or preparing place at times of triumphs on the other side which is the household side i wish it divided at the first into a hall and a chapel with a partition 
 between both of good state and bigness and those not to go all the length but 
 to have at the further end a winter and a summer parlour both fair and under these rooms a fair and large cellar sunk under ground and likewise some privy kitchens with butteries and pantries and the like 
 as for the tower i would have it two storeys of eighteen foot high a piece above the two wings and a goodly leads upon the top railed with statues interposed and the same tower to be divided into rooms as shall be thought fit the stairs likewise to the upper rooms let them be upon a fair open newel and finely railed in with images of wood cast into a brass colour and a very fair landing place at the top but this to be if you do not point any of the lower rooms for a dining place of servants for otherwise you shall have the servants dinner after your own for the steam of it will come up as in a tunnel 
 
 and so much for the front only i understand the height of the first stairs to be 
 sixteen foot which is the height of the lower room 
 
 beyond this front is there to be a fair court but three sides of it of a far lower 
 building than the front and in all the four comers of that 
 court fair staircases cast into turrets on the outside and not within the row 
 of buildings themselves but those towers are not to be of the height of the front 
 but rather proportionable to the lower building let the court not be paved for that 
 striketh up a great heat in summer and much cold in winter but only some side alleys with a cross and me quarters to graze being kept shorn but not too near shorn 
 the row of return on the banquet side let it be all stately galleries in which 
 galleries let there be three or four fine cupolas in me length of it placed at 
 equal distance and fine coloured windows of several works on the household side chambers of presence and ordinary entertainments with some and let all three sides be a double house without through lights on the sides that you may have rooms from the sun both for forenoon and afternoon cast it also that you may born for summer and winter shady for summer and warm for winter 
 
 you shall have sometimes fair houses so full of glass that one cannot tell where 
 to become to be out of the sun or cold for inbowed windows i hold them of good use in cities indeed upright do better in respect of the uniformity towards the street for they be pretty retiring places for conference and besides they keep 
 both the wind and sun off for that which would strike almost through the room doth scarce pass the window but let them be but few four in the court on the sides only 
 
 beyond this court let there be an inward court of the same square and height which is to be environed with the garden on all sides and in the inside cloistered on all sides upon decent and beautiful arches as high as the first storey on the under storey towards the garden let it be turned to a grotto or place of shade or estivation and only have opening and windows towards the garden and be level upon the floor no whit sunk under ground to avoid all dampishness and let there be a fountain or some fair work of statues in the midst of this court and to be paved as the other court was these buildings to be for privy lodgings on both sides and the end for privy galleries 
 whereof you must foresee that one of them be for an infirmary if the prince or any special person should be sick with chambers antecamera and recamera joining to it this upon the second storey upon the ground storey a fair gallery open upon pillars and upon uie third storey likewise an open gallery upon pillars to take the prospect and freshness of the garden 
 at both comers of the further side by way of return let there be two delicate or rich cabinets daintily paved richly hanged glazed with crystalline glass and a rich cupola in die midst and all other elegancy that may be thought upon in the upper gallery too i wish that there may be if the place will yield it some fountains running in divers places from the wall with some fine avoidances and thus much for the model of the palace save that you must have before you come to the front three courts a green court plain with a wall about it a second court of the same but more garnished with little turrets or rather embellishments upon the wall and a third court to make a square with the front but not to be built nor yet enclosed with a naked wall but enclosed with terraces leaded aloft and fairly garnished on the three sides and cloistered on the inside with pillars and not with arches below 
 as for offices let them stand at distance with some lofty galleries to pass 
 from them to the palace itself

 book descent 
 chapter v 
 
 vague flashes on the horizon 
 little by little and in the course of time all this opposition subsided 
 there had at first been exercised against m madeleine in virtue of a sort of law which all those who rise must submit to blackening and calumnies then they grew to be nothing more than then merely malicious remarks then even this entirely disappeared respect became complete unanimous cordial and towards the moment arrived when the word monsieur le maire was pronounced at m sur m with almost the same accent as monseigneur the bishop had been pronounced in d in 
 people came from a distance of ten leagues around to consult m madeleine 
 he put an end to differences he prevented lawsuits he reconciled enemies every one took him for the judge and with good reason it seemed as though he had for a soul the book of the natural law it was like an epidemic of veneration which in the course of six or seven years gradually took possession of the whole district 
 one single man in the town in the arrondissement absolutely escaped this contagion and whatever father madeleine did remained his opponent as though a sort of incorruptible and imperturbable instinct kept him on the alert and uneasy 
 it seems in fact as though there existed in certain men a veritable bestial instinct though pure and upright like all instincts which creates antipathies and sympathies which fatally separates one nature from another nature which does not hesitate which feels no disquiet which does not hold its peace and which never belies itself clear in its obscurity infallible imperious intractable stubborn to all counsels of the intelligence and to all the dissolvents of reason and which in whatever manner destinies are arranged secretly warns the of the presence of the and the of the presence of the 
 it frequently happened that when m madeleine was passing along a street calm affectionate surrounded by the blessings of all a man of lofty stature clad in an armed with a heavy cane and wearing a battered hat turned round abruptly behind him and followed him with his eyes until he disappeared with folded arms and a slow shake of the head and his upper lip raised in company with his lower to his nose a sort of significant grimace which might be translated by 
 what is that man after all i certainly have seen him somewhere 
 in any case i am not his dupe 
 this person grave with a gravity which was almost menacing was one of those men who even when only seen by a rapid glimpse arrest the attention 
 his name was javert and he belonged to the police 
 at m sur m he exercised the unpleasant but useful functions of an inspector 
 he had not seen beginnings 
 javert owed the post which he occupied to the protection of m chabouillet the secretary of the minister of state comte angeles then prefect of police at paris 
 when javert arrived at m sur m the fortune of the great manufacturer was already made and father madeleine had become monsieur madeleine 
 certain police officers have a peculiar physiognomy which is complicated with an air of baseness mingled with an air of authority javert possessed this physiognomy minus the baseness 
 it is our conviction that if souls were visible to the eyes we should be able to see distinctly that strange thing that each one individual of the human race corresponds to some one of the species of the animal creation and we could easily recognize this truth hardly perceived by the thinker that from the oyster to the eagle from the pig to the tiger all animals exist in man and that each one of them is in a man 
 sometimes even several of them at a time 
 animals are nothing else than the figures of our virtues and our vices straying before our eyes the visible phantoms of our souls god shows them to us in order to induce us to reflect 
 only since animals are mere shadows god has not made them capable of education in the full sense of the word what is the use 
 on the contrary our souls being realities and having a goal which is appropriate to them god has bestowed on them intelligence that is to say the possibility of education 
 social education when well done can always draw from a soul of whatever sort it may be the utility which it contains 
 this be it said is of course from the restricted point of view of the terrestrial life which is apparent and without prejudging the profound question of the anterior or ulterior personality of the beings which are not man 
 the visible i in nowise authorizes the thinker to deny the latent i 
 having made this reservation let us pass on 
 now if the reader will admit for a moment with us that in every man there is one of the animal species of creation it will be easy for us to say what there was in police officer javert 
 the peasants of asturias are convinced that in every litter of wolves there is one dog which is killed by the mother because otherwise as he grew up he would devour the other little ones 
 give to this of a wolf a human face and the result will be javert 
 javert had been born in prison of a whose husband was in the galleys 
 as he grew up he thought that he was outside the pale of society and he despaired of ever it he observed that society unpardoningly excludes two classes of men those who attack it and those who guard it he had no choice except between these two classes at the same time he was conscious of an indescribable foundation of rigidity regularity and probity complicated with an inexpressible hatred for the race of bohemians whence he was sprung 
 he entered the police he succeeded there at forty years of age he was an inspector 
 during his youth he had been employed in the convict establishments of the south 
 before proceeding further let us come to an understanding as to the words human face which we have just applied to javert 
 the human face of javert consisted of a flat nose with two deep nostrils towards which enormous whiskers ascended on his cheeks one felt ill at ease when he saw these two forests and these two caverns for the first time 
 when javert his laugh was rare and thin lips parted and revealed to view not only his teeth but his gums and around his nose there formed a flattened and savage fold as on the muzzle of a wild beast javert serious was a watchdog when he laughed he was a tiger as for the rest he had very little skull and a great deal of jaw his hair concealed his forehead and fell over his eyebrows between his eyes there was a permanent central frown like an imprint of wrath his gaze was obscure his mouth pursed up and terrible his air that of ferocious command 
 this man was composed of two very simple and two very good sentiments comparatively but he rendered them almost bad by dint of exaggerating for authority hatred of rebellion and in his eyes murder robbery all crimes are only forms of rebellion 
 he enveloped in a blind and profound faith every one who had a function in the state from the prime minister to the rural policeman 
 he covered with scorn aversion and disgust every one who had once crossed the legal threshold of evil he was absolute and admitted no exceptions 
 on the one hand he said the functionary can make no mistake the magistrate is never the wrong 
 on the other hand he said these men are irremediably lost 
 nothing good can come from them 
 he fully shared the opinion of those extreme minds which attribute to human law i know not what power of making or if the reader will have it so of authenticating demons and who place a styx at the base of society 
 he was stoical serious austere a melancholy dreamer humble and haughty like fanatics 
 his glance was like a gimlet cold and piercing 
 his whole life hung on these two words watchfulness and supervision 
 he had introduced a straight line into what is the most crooked thing in the world he possessed the conscience of his usefulness the religion of his functions and he was a spy as other men are priests 
 woe to the man who fell into his hands 
 he would have arrested his own father if the latter had escaped from the galleys and would have denounced his mother if she had broken her ban 
 and he would have done it with that sort of inward satisfaction which is conferred by virtue 
 and withal a life of privation isolation abnegation chastity with never a diversion 
 it was implacable duty the police understood as the spartans understood sparta a pitiless lying in wait a ferocious honesty a marble informer brutus in vidocq 
 whole person was expressive of the man who spies and who withdraws himself from observation 
 the mystical school of joseph de maistre which at that epoch seasoned with lofty cosmogony those things which were called the ultra newspapers would not have failed to declare that javert was a symbol his brow was not visible it disappeared beneath his hat his eyes were not visible since they were lost under his eyebrows his chin was not visible for it was plunged in his cravat his hands were not visible they were drawn up in his sleeves and his cane was not visible he carried it under his coat but when the occasion presented itself there was suddenly seen to emerge from all this shadow as from an ambuscade a narrow and angular forehead a baleful glance a threatening chin enormous hands and a monstrous cudgel 
 in his leisure moments which were far from frequent he read although he hated books this caused him to be not wholly illiterate this could be recognized by some emphasis in his speech 
 as we have said he had no vices 
 when he was pleased with himself he permitted himself a pinch of snuff 
 therein lay his connection with humanity 
 the reader will have no difficulty in understanding that javert was the terror of that whole class which the annual statistics of the ministry of justice designates under the rubric vagrants the name of javert routed them by its mere utterance the face of javert petrified them at sight 
 such was this formidable man 
 javert was like an eye constantly fixed on m madeleine 
 an eye full of suspicion and conjecture 
 m madeleine had finally perceived the fact but it seemed to be of no importance to him 
 he did not even put a question to javert he neither sought nor avoided him he bore that embarrassing and almost oppressive gaze without appearing to notice it 
 he treated javert with ease and courtesy as he did all the rest of the world 
 it was divined from some words which escaped javert that he had secretly investigated with that curiosity which belongs to the race and into which there enters as much instinct as will all the anterior traces which father madeleine might have left elsewhere he seemed to know and he sometimes said in covert words that some one had gleaned certain information in a certain district about a family which had disappeared 
 once he chanced to say as he was talking to himself i think i have him then he remained pensive for three days and uttered not a word it seemed that the thread which he thought he held had broken 
 moreover and this furnishes the necessary corrective for the too absolute sense which certain words might present there can be nothing really infallible in a human creature and the peculiarity of instinct is that it can become confused thrown off the track and defeated 
 otherwise it would be superior to intelligence and the beast would be found to be provided with a better light than man 
 javert was evidently somewhat disconcerted by the perfect naturalness and tranquillity of m madeleine 
 one day nevertheless his strange manner appeared to produce an impression on m madeleine 
 it was on the following occasion

 book two 
 chapter xvii 
 
 mounting his horse again prince andrew lingered with the battery looking at the puff from the gun that had sent the ball his eyes ran rapidly over the wide space but he only saw that the hitherto motionless masses of the french now swayed and that there really was a battery to their left the smoke above it had not yet dispersed two mounted frenchmen probably adjutants were galloping up the hill a small but distinctly visible enemy column was moving down the hill probably to strengthen the front line the smoke of the first shot had not yet dispersed before another puff appeared followed by a report the battle had begun prince andrew turned his horse and galloped back to grunth to find prince bagration he heard the cannonade behind him growing louder and more frequent evidently our guns had begun to reply from the bottom of the slope where the parleys had taken place came the report of musketry 
 lemarrois had just arrived at a gallop with stern letter and murat humiliated and anxious to expiate his fault had at once moved his forces to attack the center and outflank both the russian wings hoping before evening and before the arrival of the emperor to crush the contemptible detachment that stood before him 
 it has begun here it is thought prince andrew feeling the blood rush to his heart but where and how will my toulon present itself 
 passing between the companies that had been eating porridge and drinking vodka a quarter of an hour before he saw everywhere the same rapid movement of soldiers forming ranks and getting their muskets ready and on all their faces he recognized the same eagerness that filled his heart it has begun here it is dreadful but enjoyable was what the face of each soldier and each officer seemed to say 
 before he had reached the embankments that were being thrown up he saw in the light of the dull autumn evening mounted men coming toward him the foremost wearing a cossack cloak and lambskin cap and riding a white horse was prince bagration prince andrew stopped waiting for him to come up prince bagration reined in his horse and recognizing prince andrew nodded to him he still looked ahead while prince andrew told him what he had seen 
 the feeling it has begun here it is was seen even on prince hard brown face with its dull sleepy eyes prince andrew gazed with anxious curiosity at that impassive face and wished he could tell what if anything this man was thinking and feeling at that moment is there anything at all behind that impassive face prince andrew asked himself as he looked prince bagration bent his head in sign of agreement with what prince andrew told him and said very good in a tone that seemed to imply that everything that took place and was reported to him was exactly what he had foreseen prince andrew out of breath with his rapid ride spoke quickly prince bagration uttering his words with an oriental accent spoke particularly slowly as if to impress the fact that there was no need to hurry however he put his horse to a trot in the direction of battery prince andrew followed with the suite behind prince bagration rode an officer of the suite the personal adjutant zherkov an orderly officer the staff officer on duty riding a fine bobtailed horse and a civilian an accountant who had asked permission to be present at the battle out of curiosity the accountant a stout man looked around him with a naive smile of satisfaction and presented a strange appearance among the hussars cossacks and adjutants in his camlet coat as he jolted on his horse with a convoy saddle 
 he wants to see a battle said zherkov to bolkonski pointing to the accountant but he feels a pain in the pit of his stomach already 
 oh leave off said the accountant with a beaming but rather cunning smile as if flattered at being made the subject of joke and purposely trying to appear stupider than he really was 
 it is very strange mon monsieur prince said the staff officer he remembered that in french there is some peculiar way of addressing a prince but could not get it quite right 
 by this time they were all approaching battery and a ball struck the ground in front of them 
 that that has fallen asked the accountant with a naive smile 
 a french pancake answered zherkov 
 so what they hit with asked the accountant how awful 
 he seemed to swell with satisfaction he had hardly finished speaking when they again heard an unexpectedly violent whistling which suddenly ended with a thud into something soft and a cossack riding a little to their right and behind the accountant crashed to earth with his horse zherkov and the staff officer bent over their saddles and turned their horses away the accountant stopped facing the cossack and examined him with attentive curiosity the cossack was dead but the horse still struggled 
 prince bagration screwed up his eyes looked round and seeing the cause of the confusion turned away with indifference as if to say is it worth while noticing trifles he reined in his horse with the case of a skillful rider and slightly bending over disengaged his saber which had caught in his cloak it was an saber of a kind no longer in general use prince andrew remembered the story of suvorov giving his saber to bagration in italy and the recollection was particularly pleasant at that moment they had reached the battery at which prince andrew had been when he examined the battlefield 
 whose company asked prince bagration of an artilleryman standing by the ammunition wagon 
 he asked whose company but he really meant are you frightened here and the artilleryman understood him 
 captain your excellency shouted the freckled gunner in a merry voice standing to attention 
 yes yes muttered bagration as if considering something and he rode past the limbers to the farthest cannon 
 as he approached a ringing shot issued from it deafening him and his suite and in the smoke that suddenly surrounded the gun they could see the gunners who had seized it straining to roll it quickly back to its former position a huge gunner number one holding a mop his legs far apart sprang to the wheel while number two with a trembling hand placed a charge in the mouth the short captain tushin stumbling over the tail of the gun carriage moved forward and not noticing the general looked out shading his eyes with his small hand 
 lift it two lines more and it will be just right cried he in a feeble voice to which he tried to impart a dashing note ill suited to his weak figure number two he squeaked fire medvedev 
 bagration called to him and tushin raising three fingers to his cap with a bashful and awkward gesture not at all like a military salute but like a benediction approached the general though guns had been intended to cannonade the valley he was firing incendiary balls at the village of schon grabern visible just opposite in front of which large masses of french were advancing 
 no one had given tushin orders where and at what to fire but after consulting his sergeant major zakharchenko for whom he had great respect he had decided that it would be a good thing to set fire to the village very good said bagration in reply to the report and began deliberately to examine the whole battlefield extended before him the french had advanced nearest on our right below the height on which the kiev regiment was stationed in the hollow where the rivulet flowed the rolling and crackling of musketry was heard and much farther to the right beyond the dragoons the officer of the suite pointed out to bagration a french column that was outflanking us to the left the horizon bounded by the adjacent wood prince bagration ordered two battalions from the center to be sent to reinforce the right flank the officer of the suite ventured to remark to the prince that if these battalions went away the guns would remain without support prince bagration turned to the officer and with his dull eyes looked at him in silence it seemed to prince andrew that the remark was just and that really no answer could be made to it but at that moment an adjutant galloped up with a message from the commander of the regiment in the hollow and news that immense masses of the french were coming down upon them and that his regiment was in disorder and was retreating upon the kiev grenadiers prince bagration bowed his head in sign of assent and approval he rode off at a walk to the right and sent an adjutant to the dragoons with orders to attack the french but this adjutant returned half an hour later with the news that the commander of the dragoons had already retreated beyond the dip in the ground as a heavy fire had been opened on him and he was losing men uselessly and so had hastened to throw some sharpshooters into the wood 
 very good said bagration 
 as he was leaving the battery firing was heard on the left also and as it was too far to the left flank for him to have time to go there himself prince bagration sent zherkov to tell the general in command the one who had paraded his regiment before kutuzov at braunau that he must retreat as quickly as possible behind the hollow in the rear as the right flank would probably not be able to withstand the attack very long about tushin and the battalion that had been in support of his battery all was forgotten prince andrew listened attentively to colloquies with the commanding officers and the orders he gave them and to his surprise found that no orders were really given but that prince bagration tried to make it appear that everything done by necessity by accident or by the will of subordinate commanders was done if not by his direct command at least in accord with his intentions prince andrew noticed however that though what happened was due to chance and was independent of the will owing to the tact bagration showed his presence was very valuable officers who approached him with disturbed countenances became calm soldiers and officers greeted him gaily grew more cheerful in his presence and were evidently anxious to display their courage before him

 chapter 
 
 i cannot feel that i have done my duty as humble historian of the march family without devoting at least one chapter to the two most precious and important members of it daisy and demi had now arrived at years of discretion for in this fast age babies of three or four assert their rights and get them too which is more than many of their elders do if there ever were a pair of twins in danger of being utterly spoiled by adoration it was these prattling brookes of course they were the most remarkable children ever born as will be shown when i mention that they walked at eight months talked fluently at twelve months and at two years they took their places at table and behaved with a propriety which charmed all beholders at three daisy demanded a needler and actually made a bag with four stitches in it she likewise set up housekeeping in the sideboard and managed a microscopic cooking stove with a skill that brought tears of pride to eyes while demi learned his letters with his grandfather who invented a new mode of teaching the alphabet by forming letters with his arms and legs thus uniting gymnastics for head and heels the boy early developed a mechanical genius which delighted his father and distracted his mother for he tried to imitate every machine he saw and kept the nursery in a chaotic condition with his sewinsheen a mysterious structure of string chairs clothespins and spools for wheels to go wound and wound also a basket hung over the back of a chair in which he vainly tried to hoist his too confiding sister who with feminine devotion allowed her little head to be bumped till rescued when the young inventor indignantly remarked why marmar my lellywaiter and trying to pull her up 
 
 though utterly unlike in character the twins got on remarkably well together and seldom quarreled more than thrice a day of course demi tyrannized over daisy and gallantly defended her from every other aggressor while daisy made a galley slave of herself and adored her brother as the one perfect being in the world a rosy chubby sunshiny little soul was daisy who found her way to heart and nestled there one of the captivating children who seem made to be kissed and cuddled adorned and adored like little goddesses and produced for general approval on all festive occasions her small virtues were so sweet that she would have been quite angelic if a few small naughtinesses had not kept her delightfully human it was all fair weather in her world and every morning she scrambled up to the window in her little nightgown to look our and say no matter whether it rained or shone oh pitty day oh pitty day everyone was a friend and she offered kisses to a stranger so confidingly that the most inveterate bachelor relented and became faithful worshipers 
 
 me loves evvybody she once said opening her arms with her spoon in one hand and her mug in the other as if eager to embrace and nourish the whole world 
 
 as she grew her mother began to feel that the dovecote would be blessed by the presence of an inmate as serene and loving as that which had helped to make the old house home and to pray that she might be spared a loss like that which had latelytaught them how long they had entertained an angel unawares her grandfather often called her beth and her grandmother watched over her with untiring devotion as if trying to atone for some past mistake which no eye but her own could see 
 
 demi like a true yankee was of an inquiring turn wanting to know everything and often getting much disturbed because he could not get satisfactory answers to his perpetual what for 
 
 he also possessed a philosophic bent to the great delight of his grandfather who used to hold socratic conversations with him in which the precocious pupil occasionally posed his teacher to the undisguised satisfaction of the womenfolk 
 
 what makes my legs go dranpa asked the young philosopher surveying those active portions of his frame with a meditative air while resting after a frolic one night 
 
 your little mind demi replied the sage stroking the yellow head respectfully 
 
 what is a little mine 
 
 it is something which makes your body move as the spring made the wheels go in my watch when i showed it to you 
 
 open me i want to see it go wound 
 
 i do that any more than you could open the watch god winds you up and you go till he stops you 
 
 does i and brown eyes grew big and bright as he took in the new thought is i wounded up like the watch 
 
 yes but i show you how for it is done when we see 
 
 demi felt his back as if expecting to find it like that of the watch and then gravely remarked i dess dod does it when asleep 
 
 a careful explanation followed to which he listened so attentively that his anxious grandmother said my dear do you think it wise to talk about such things to that baby getting great bumps 
 over his eyes and learning to ask the most unanswerable questions 
 if he is old enough to ask the question he is old enough to receive true answers i am not putting the thoughts into his head but helping him unfold those already there these children are wiser than we are and i have no doubt the boy understands every word i have said to him now demi tell me where you keep your mind 
 
 if the boy had replied like alcibiades by the gods socrates i cannot tell his grandfather would not have been surprised but when after standing a moment on one leg like a meditative youngstork he answered in a tone of calm conviction in my little belly the old gentleman could only join in laugh and dismiss the class in metaphysics 
 
 there might have been cause for maternal anxiety if demi had not given convincing proofs that he was a true boy as well as a budding philosopher for often after a discussion which caused hannah to prophesy with ominous nods that child long for this world he would turn about and set her fears at rest by some of the pranks with which dear dirty naughty little rascals distract and delight their souls 
 
 meg made many moral rules and tried to keep them but what mother was ever proof against the winning wiles the ingenious evasions or the tranquil audacity of the miniature men and women who so early show themselves accomplished artful dodgers 
 
 no more raisins demi make you sick says mamma to the young person who offers his services in the kitchen with unfailing regularity on day 
 
 me likes to be sick 
 
 i want to have you so run away and help daisy make patty cakes 
 
 he reluctantly departs but his wrongs weigh upon his spirit and when an opportunity comes to redress them he outwits mamma by a shrewd bargain 
 
 now you have been good children and play anything you like says meg as she leads her assistant cooks upstairs when the pudding is safely bouncing in the pot 
 
 truly marmar asks demi with a brilliant idea in his head 
 
 yes truly anything you say replies the shortsighted parent preparing herself to sing the three little kittens half a dozen times over or to take her family to buy a penny bun regardless of wind or limb but demi corners her by the cool reply 
 
 then go and eat up all the raisins 
 
 aunt dodo was chief playmate and confidante of both children and the trio turned the little house aunt amy was as yet only a name to them aunt beth soon faded into a pleasantly vague memory but aunt dodo was a living reality and they made the most of her for which compliment she was deeply grateful but when mr bhaer came jo neglected her playfellows and dismay and desolation fell upon their little souls daisy who was fond of going about peddling kisses lost her best customer and became bankrupt demi with infantile penetration soon discovered that dodo like to play with the better than she did him but though hurt he concealed his anguish for he the heart to insult a rival who kept a mine of chocolate drops inhis waistcoat pocket and a watch that could be taken out of its case and freely shaken by ardent admirers 
 
 some persons might have considered these pleasing liberties as bribes but demi see it in that light and continued to patronize the the with pensive affability while daisy bestowed her small affections upon him at the third call and considered his shoulder her throne his arm her refuge his gifts treasures surpassing worth 
 
 gentlemen are sometimes seized with sudden fits of admiration for the young relatives of ladies whom they honor with their regard but this counterfeit philoprogenitiveness sits uneasily upon them and does not deceive anybody a particle mr devotion was sincere however likewise honesty is the best policy in love as in law he was one of the men who are at home with children and looked particularly well when little faces made a pleasant contrast with his manly one his business whatever it was detained him from day to day but evening seldom failed to bring him out to he always asked for mr march so i suppose he was the attraction the excellent papa labored under the delusion that he was and reveled in long discussions with the kindred spirit till a chance remark of his more observing grandson suddenly enlightened him 
 
 mr bhaer came in one evening to pause on the threshold of the study astonished by the spectacle that met his eye prone uponthe floor lay mr march with his respectable legs in the air and beside him likewise prone was demi trying to imitate the attitude with his own short legs both grovelers so seriously absorbed that they were unconscious of spectators till mr bhaer laughed his sonorous laugh and jo cried out with a scandalized face 
 
 father father the professor 
 
 down went the black legs and up came the gray head as the preceptor said with undisturbed dignity good evening mr bhaer excuse me for a moment we are just finishing our lesson now demi make the letter and tell its name 
 
 i knows him and after a few convulsive efforts the red legs tok the shape of a pair of compasses and the intelligent pupil triumphantly shouted a we dranpa a we 
 
 a born weller laughed jo as her parent gathered himself up and her nephew tried to stand on his head as the only mode of expressing his satisfaction that school was over 
 
 what have you been at today bubchen asked mr bhaer picking up the gymnast 
 
 me went to see little mary 
 
 and what did you there 
 
 i kissed her began demi with artless frankness prut thou beginnest early what did the little mary say to that asked mr bhaer continuing to confess the young sinner who stood upon the knee exploring the waistcoat pocket 
 
 oh she liked it and she kissed me and i liked it little boys like little girls asked demi with his mouth full and an air of bland satisfaction 
 
 you precious chick who put that into your head said jo enjoying the innocent revelation as much as the professor 
 
 in mine head in mine mouf answered literal demi putting out his tongue with a chocolate drop on it thinking she alluded to confectionery not ideas 
 
 thou shouldst save some for the little friend sweets to the sweet mannling and mr bhaer offered jo some with a look that made her wonder if chocolate was not the nectar drunk by the gods demi also saw the smile was impressed by it and artlessy inquired 
 
 do great boys like great girls to fessor 
 
 like young washington mr bhaer tell a lie so he gave the somewhat vague reply that he believed they did sometimes in a tone that made mr march put down his clothesbrush glance at retiring face and then sink into his chair looking as if the precocious chick had put an idea into his head that was both sweet and sour 
 
 why dodo when she caught him in the china closet half an hour afterward nearly squeezed the breath out of his little body with a tender embrace instead of shaking him for being there and why she followed up this novel performance by the unexpected gift of a big slice of bread and jelly remained one of the problems over which demi puzzled his small wits and was forced to leave unsolved forever

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the drop of water 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 of course you know what is meant by a magnifying glass one of 
 those round that make everything look a hundred 
 times bigger than it is when any one takes one of these and holds 
 it to his eye and looks at a drop of water from the pond yonder he 
 sees above a thousand wonderful creatures that are otherwise never 
 discerned in the water but there they are and it is no delusion 
 it almost looks like a great plateful of spiders jumping about in a 
 crowd and how fierce they are they tear off each legs and 
 arms and bodies before and behind and yet they are merry and 
 joyful in their way 
 
 now there once was an old man whom all the people called 
 for that was his name he always wanted the best of 
 everything and when he could not manage it otherwise he did it by 
 magic 
 
 there he sat one day and held his to his eye 
 and looked at a drop of water that had been taken out of a puddle by 
 the ditch but what a kribbling and krabbling was there all the 
 thousands of little creatures hopped and sprang and tugged at one 
 another and ate each other up 
 
 that is horrible said old can one not 
 persuade them to live in peace and quietness so that each one may 
 mind his own business 
 
 and he thought it over and over but it would not do and so he 
 had recourse to magic 
 
 i must give them color that they may be seen more plainly said 
 he and he poured something like a little drop of red wine into the 
 drop of water but it was witches blood from the lobes of the ear 
 the finest kind at ninepence a drop and now the wonderful little 
 creatures were pink all over it looked like a whole town of naked 
 wild men 
 
 what have you there asked another old magician who had no 
 name and that was the best thing about him 
 
 yes if you can guess what it is said 
 make you a present of it 
 
 but it is not so easy to find out if one does not know 
 and the magician who had no name looked through the 
 
 
 it looked really like a great town reflected there in which all 
 the people were running about without clothes it was terrible but it 
 was still more terrible to see how one beat and pushed the other 
 and bit and hacked and tugged and mauled him those at the top were being pulled down and those at the bottom were struggling upwards 
 
 look look his leg is longer than mine bah away with it there 
 is one who has a little bruise it hurts him but it shall hurt him 
 still more 
 
 and they hacked away at him and they pulled at him and ate him 
 up because of the little bruise and there was one sitting as still 
 as any little maiden and wishing only for peace and quietness but 
 now she had to come out and they tugged at her and pulled her about and ate her up 
 
 funny said the magician 
 
 yes but what do you think it is said can you 
 find that out 
 
 why one can see that easily enough said the other paris 
 or some other great city for all alike a great city 
 
 a drop of puddle water said 
 
 the end

 of gardens 
 god almighty first planted a garden and indeed it is the purest of human pleasure it is the greatest refreshment to the spirits of man 
 without which buildings and palaces are but gross and a man shall ever see that when ages grow to civility and elegance men come to build stately sooner than to garden finely as if gardening were the greater perfection i do hold it in the royal ordering of gardens there ought to be gardens for all the months in 
 me year in which severally things of beauty may be then in season for december and january and the latter part of november you must take such things as are green all winter holly ivy bays juniper cypress trees yew pineapple trees fir trees rosemary lavender periwinkle the white the purple and the blue germander flags orange trees lemon trees and myrtles if they be stoved and sweet marjoram warm set 
 there followeth for the latter part of january and february the mezereon tree 
 which then blossoms avcusvemus both the yellow and the grey primroses anemones the early tulip hyadnthus onentalis for march there come violets specially the single blue which are the earliest the yellow daffodil 
 the daisy the almond tree in blossom the peach tree in blossom the cornelian tree 
 in blossom sweet briar 
 in april follow the double white violet the wallflower the stock gillyflower the cowslip and lilies of all natures rosemary flowers the tulip the double peony the pale daffodil the french honeysuckle the cherry tree in blossom the damson and plum trees in blossom the white thorn in leaf the lilac tree in may and june come pinks of all sorts specially the blush pink roses of all kinds except the musk which comes later honeysuckles strawberries bugloss columbine the french marigold ftos qfiiainus cheny tree in fruit rihs figs in fruit 
 raspberries vine flowers lavender in flowers the sweet satyrian with the white 
 flower herba nvsoana iilaan comaswm the apple tree in blossom in july come 
 gillyflowers of all varieties musk roses the lime tree in blossom early pears 
 and plums in fruit ginnitings quadlins in august come plums of all sorts in fruit pears apricots berberries filberts musk melons of all colours in september come grapes apples poppies of all colours peaches nectarines cornelians wardens quinces in october and the beginning of november come services medlars bullises roses cut or removed to come late holly oaks and such like 
 these particulars are for the climate of london but my meaning is perceived that you may have verperpecuwn as the place affords 
 
 and because me breath of flowers is far sweeter in the air where it comes and goes like the warbling of music than in the hand therefore nothing is more fit for that delight than to know what be the flowers and plants that do best perfume the air 
 roses damask and red are fast flowers of their smells so that you may walk by a 
 whole row of them and find nothing of their sweetness yea though it be in a dew bays likewise yield no smell as they grow rosemary little nor sweet marjoram 
 
 that which above all others yields the sweetest smell in the air is the violet 
 specially the white double violet which comes twice a year about the middle of april and about next to that is the musk rose then the strawberry leaves dying which yield a most excellent cordial smell then the flower of me vines it is a little dust like the dust of a bent which grows upon the cluster in the first coming forth then sweet briar then wallflowers which are very delightful to be set under a parlour or lower chamber window then pinks and gillyflowers specially the matted pink and clove gillyflower then the flowers of the lime tree 
 then the honeysuckles so they be somewhat a far off of bean flowers i speak not because they are field flowers but those which perfume the air most delightfully not passed by as me rest but being trodden upon and crushed are three that is bumet wild thyme and water mints therefore you are to set whole alleys of them to have the pleasure when you walk or tread 
 
 for gardens speaking of those which are indeed princelike as we have done of 
 buildings the contents ought not well to be under thirty acres of ground and to 
 be divided into three parts a green in the entrance a heath or desert in die going 
 forth and the main garden in the midst besides alleys on both sides and i like 
 well that four acres of ground be assigned to the green six to the heath four and 
 four to either side and twelve to the main garden the green hath two pleasures 
 the one because nothing is more pleasant to the eye than green grass kept finely 
 shorn the other because it will give you a fair alley in the midst by which you 
 may go in front upon a stately hedge which is to enclose the garden 
 but because the alley will be long and in great heat of the year or day you ought not to buy the shade in the garden by going in the sun through the green therefore you are of either side the green to plant a covert alley upon work about twelve foot in height by which you may go in shade into the garden as for the making of knots or figures with divers coloured earths mat they may lie under the windows of the house on that side which the garden stands they be but toys you may see as good sights many times in tarts t 
 the garden is best to be square encompassed on all the four sides with a stately arched hedge the arches to be upon pillars of work of some ten foot high and six foot broad and the spaces between of the same dimension with the breadth of the arch over the arches let there be an entire hedge of some four foot high framed also upon work and upon the upper hedge over every arch a little turret with a belly enough to receive a cage of birds and over every space between the arches some other lime figure with broad plates of round coloured glass gilt for the sun to play upon but mis hedge i intend to be raised upon a bank not steep but gently slope of some six foot set all with flowers 
 also i understand that this square of the garden should not be the whole breadth of the ground but to leave on either side ground enough for diversity of side alleys unto which the two covert alleys of the green may deliver you but there must be no alleys with hedges at either end of this great enclosure not at the hither end for letting your prospect upon mis fair hedge from the green nor at the further end for letting your prospect from the hedge through the arches upon the heath 
 
 for the ordering of the ground within the great hedge i leave it to variety of device advising nevertheless that whatsoever form you cast it into first it be not too busy or full of work wherein i for my part do not like images cut out in juniper or other garden stuff they be for children little low hedges round like welts with some pretty pyramids i like well and in some places fair columns upon frames of work i would also have the alleys spacious and fair 
 you may have closer alleys upon the side grounds but none in the main garden i wish also in the very middle a fair mount with three ascents and alleys enough for four to walk abreast which i would have to be perfect circles without any bulwarks or embossment and the whole mount to be thirty foot high and some fine banqueting house with some chimneys neatly cast and without too much glass 
 
 for fountains they are a great beauty and refreshment but pools mar all and make the garden unwholesome and full of flies and frogs fountains i intend to be of two natures the one that sprinkleth or spouteth water the other a fair receipt 
 of water of some thirty or forty foot square but without fish or slime or mud 
 for the first the ornaments of images gilt or of marble which are in use do well 
 but the main matter is so to convey the water as it never stay either in the bowls 
 or in the cistern that the water be never by rest discoloured green or red or 
 the like or gather any mossiness or putrefaction besides that it is to be cleansed 
 every day by the hand also some steps up to it and some fine pavement about it 
 doth well 
 as for the other kind of fountain which we may call a bathing pool it may admit much curiosity and beauty wherewith we will not trouble ourselves as 
 that the bottom be finely paved and with images the sides likewise and withal 
 embellished with coloured glass and such things of lustre encompassed also with 
 fine rails of low statues but the main point is the same which we mentioned in 
 the former kind of fountain which is that the water be in perpetual motion fed 
 by a water higher than the pool and delivered into it by fair spouts and then 
 discharged away under ground by some equality of bores that it stay little and 
 for fine devices of arching water without spilling and making it rise in several 
 forms of feathers drinking glasses canopies and the like they be pretty things 
 to look on but nothing to health and sweetness 
 for the heath which was the third part of our plot i wish it to be framed as much 
 as may be to a natural wildness trees i would have none in it but some thickets 
 made only of and honeysuckle and some wild vine amongst and the ground set with violets strawberries and primroses for these are sweet and prosper in the shade 
 and these to be in the heath here and there not in any order i like 
 also little heaps in the nature of such as are in wild heaths to be 
 set some with wild thyme some with pinks some with germander that gives a good flower to the eye some with periwinkles some with violets some with strawberries some with cowslips some with daisies some with red roses some with lilium convallium some with red some with and the like low flowers being withal sweet and sightly part of which heaps to be with standards of little bushes pricked upon their top and part without 
 
 the standards to be roses jumper holly berberries but here and there because of the smell of their blossom red currants gooseberries rosemary bays and such like but these standards to be kept with cutting that they grow not out of course 
 
 for the side grounds you are to fill them with variety of alleys private to give 
 a full shade some of them wheresoever the sun be you are to frame some of them likewise for shelter that when the wind blows sharp you may walk as in a gallery 
 
 and those alleys must be likewise hedged at both ends to keep out the wind and 
 these closer alleys must be ever finely gravelled and no grass because of going 
 wet in many of these alleys likewise you are to set fruit trees of all sorts as 
 well upon the walls as in ranges and this would be generally observed that the 
 borders wherein you plant your fruit trees be fair and large and low and not steep and set with fine flowers but thin and sparingly lest they deceive trees at the end of both the side grounds i would have a mount of some pretty height leaving the wall of the enclosure breast high to look abroad into the fields 
 
 for the main garden i do not deny but there should be some fair alleys ranged on 
 both sides with fruit trees and some pretty tufts of fruit trees and arbours with 
 seats set in some decent order but these to be by no means set too thick but to 
 leave the main garden so as it be not close but the air open and free for as for 
 shade i would have you rest upon the alleys of the side grounds there to walk if 
 you be disposed in the heat of the year or day but to make account that the main 
 garden is for the more temperate parts of the year and in the heat of summer for 
 the morning and the evening or days 
 
 for aviaries i like them not except they be of that largeness as they may be turfed and have living plants and bushes set in them that the birds may have more scope and natural nesting and that no foulness appear in the floor of the aviary so i have made a platform of a princely garden partly by precept partly by drawing not a model but some general lines of it and in this i have spared for no cost but it is nothing for great princes that for the most part taking advice with workmen with no less cost set their things together and sometimes add statues and such things for state and magnificence but nothing to the true pleasure of a garden

 father fauchelevent 
 one morning m madeleine was passing through an unpaved alley of m sur m he heard a noise and saw a group some distance away he approached 
 an old man named father fauchelevent had just fallen beneath his cart his horse having tumbled down 
 this fauchelevent was one of the few enemies whom m madeleine had at that time 
 when madeleine arrived in the neighborhood fauchelevent an and a peasant who was almost educated had a business which was beginning to be in a bad way 
 fauchelevent had seen this simple workman grow rich while he a lawyer was being ruined this had filled him with jealousy and he had done all he could on every occasion to injure madeleine 
 then bankruptcy had come and as the old man had nothing left but a cart and a horse and neither family nor children he had turned carter 
 the horse had two broken legs and could not rise 
 the old man was caught in the wheels 
 the fall had been so unlucky that the whole weight of the vehicle rested on his breast 
 the cart was quite heavily laden 
 father fauchelevent was rattling in the throat in the most lamentable manner 
 they had tried but in vain to drag him out 
 an unmethodical effort aid awkwardly given a wrong shake might kill him 
 it was impossible to disengage him otherwise than by lifting the vehicle off of him 
 javert who had come up at the moment of the accident had sent for a 
 m madeleine arrived 
 people stood aside respectfully 
 help cried old fauchelevent 
 who will be good and save the old man 
 turned towards those present 
 is there a to be had 
 one has been sent for answered the peasant 
 how long will it take to get it 
 they have gone for the nearest to place where there is a farrier but it makes no difference it will take a good quarter of an hour 
 a quarter of an hour exclaimed madeleine 
 it had rained on the preceding night the soil was soaked 
 the cart was sinking deeper into the earth every moment and crushing the old breast more and more it was evident that his ribs would be broken in five minutes more 
 it is impossible to wait another quarter of an hour said madeleine to the peasants who were staring at him 
 we must 
 but it will be too late then 
 you see that the cart is sinking 
 well 
 listen resumed madeleine there is still room enough under the cart to allow a man to crawl beneath it and raise it with his back only half a minute and the poor man can be taken out 
 is there any one here who has stout loins and heart 
 there are five louis to be earned 
 not a man in the group stirred 
 ten louis said madeleine 
 the persons present dropped their eyes 
 one of them muttered a man would need to be devilish strong 
 and then he runs the risk of getting crushed 
 come began madeleine again twenty louis 
 the same silence 
 it is not the will which is lacking said a voice 
 m madeleine turned round and recognized javert 
 he had not noticed him on his arrival 
 javert went on 
 it is strength 
 one would have to be a terrible man to do such a thing as lift a cart like that on his back 
 then gazing fixedly at m madeleine he went on emphasizing every word that he uttered 
 monsieur madeleine i have never known but one man capable of doing what you ask 
 madeleine shuddered 
 javert added with an air of indifference but without removing his eyes from madeleine 
 he was a convict 
 ah said madeleine 
 in the galleys at toulon 
 madeleine turned pale 
 meanwhile the cart continued to sink slowly 
 father fauchelevent rattled in the throat and shrieked 
 i am strangling 
 my ribs are breaking a screw something 
 ah 
 madeleine glanced about him 
 is there then no one who wishes to earn twenty louis and save the life of this poor old man 
 no one stirred 
 javert resumed 
 i have never known but one man who could take the place of a screw and he was that convict 
 ah 
 it is crushing me cried the old man 
 madeleine raised his head met falcon eye still fixed upon him looked at the motionless peasants and smiled sadly then without saying a word he fell on his knees and before the crowd had even had time to utter a cry he was underneath the vehicle 
 a terrible moment of expectation and silence ensued 
 they beheld madeleine almost flat on his stomach beneath that terrible weight make two vain efforts to bring his knees and his elbows together 
 they shouted to him father madeleine come out old fauchelevent himself said to him monsieur madeleine go away you see that i am fated to die 
 leave me 
 you will get yourself crushed also 
 madeleine made no reply 
 all the spectators were panting 
 the wheels had continued to sink and it had become almost impossible for madeleine to make his way from under the vehicle 
 suddenly the enormous mass was seen to quiver the cart rose slowly the wheels half emerged from the ruts 
 they heard a stifled voice crying make haste 
 help 
 it was madeleine who had just made a final effort 
 they rushed forwards 
 the devotion of a single man had given force and courage to all 
 the cart was raised by twenty arms old fauchelevent was saved 
 madeleine rose 
 he was pale though dripping with perspiration his clothes were torn and covered with mud 
 all wept 
 the old man kissed his knees and called him the good god 
 as for him he bore upon his countenance an indescribable expression of happy and celestial suffering and he fixed his tranquil eye on javert who was still staring at him

 chapter xviii 
 
 prince bagration having reached the highest point of our right flank began riding downhill to where the roll of musketry was heard but where on account of the smoke nothing could be seen the nearer they got to the hollow the less they could see but the more they felt the nearness of the actual battlefield they began to meet wounded men one with a bleeding head and no cap was being dragged along by two soldiers who supported him under the arms there was a gurgle in his throat and he was spitting blood a bullet had evidently hit him in the throat or mouth another was walking sturdily by himself but without his musket groaning aloud and swinging his arm which had just been hurt while blood from it was streaming over his greatcoat as from a bottle he had that moment been wounded and his face showed fear rather than suffering crossing a road they descended a steep incline and saw several men lying on the ground they also met a crowd of soldiers some of whom were unwounded the soldiers were ascending the hill breathing heavily and despite the presence were talking loudly and gesticulating in front of them rows of gray cloaks were already visible through the smoke and an officer catching sight of bagration rushed shouting after the crowd of retreating soldiers ordering them back bagration rode up to the ranks along which shots crackled now here and now there drowning the sound of voices and the shouts of command the whole air reeked with smoke the excited faces of the soldiers were blackened with it some were using their ramrods others putting powder on the touchpans or taking charges from their pouches while others were firing though who they were firing at could not be seen for the smoke which there was no wind to carry away a pleasant humming and whistling of bullets were often heard what is this thought prince andrew approaching the crowd of soldiers it be an attack for they are not moving it be a square for they are not drawn up for that 
 the commander of the regiment a thin old man with a pleasant smile his eyelids drooping more than half over his old eyes giving him a mild expression rode up to bagration and welcomed him as a host welcomes an honored guest he reported that his regiment had been attacked by french cavalry and that though the attack had been repulsed he had lost more than half his men he said the attack had been repulsed employing this military term to describe what had occurred to his regiment but in reality he did not himself know what had happened during that to the troops entrusted to him and could not say with certainty whether the attack had been repulsed or his regiment had been broken up all he knew was that at the commencement of the action balls and shells began flying all over his regiment and hitting men and that afterwards someone had shouted cavalry and our men had begun firing they were still firing not at the cavalry which had disappeared but at french infantry who had come into the hollow and were firing at our men prince bagration bowed his head as a sign that this was exactly what he had desired and expected turning to his adjutant he ordered him to bring down the two battalions of the sixth chasseurs whom they had just passed prince andrew was struck by the changed expression on prince face at this moment it expressed the concentrated and happy resolution you see on the face of a man who on a hot day takes a final run before plunging into the water the dull sleepy expression was no longer there nor the affectation of profound thought the round steady eyes looked before him eagerly and rather disdainfully not resting on anything although his movements were still slow and measured 
 the commander of the regiment turned to prince bagration entreating him to go back as it was too dangerous to remain where they were please your excellency for sake he kept saying glancing for support at an officer of the suite who turned away from him there you see and he drew attention to the bullets whistling singing and hissing continually around them he spoke in the tone of entreaty and reproach that a carpenter uses to a gentleman who has picked up an ax we are used to it but you sir will blister your hands he spoke as if those bullets could not kill him and his eyes gave still more persuasiveness to his words the staff officer joined in the appeals but bagration did not reply he only gave an order to cease firing and so as to give room for the two approaching battalions while he was speaking the curtain of smoke that had concealed the hollow driven by a rising wind began to move from right to left as if drawn by an invisible hand and the hill opposite with the french moving about on it opened out before them all eyes fastened involuntarily on this french column advancing against them and winding down over the uneven ground one could already see the soldiers shaggy caps distinguish the officers from the men and see the standard flapping against its staff 
 they march splendidly remarked someone in suite 
 the head of the column had already descended into the hollow the clash would take place on this side of it 
 the remains of our regiment which had been in action rapidly formed up and moved to the right from behind it dispersing the laggards came two battalions of the sixth chasseurs in fine order before they had reached bagration the weighty tread of the mass of men marching in step could be heard on their left flank nearest to bagration marched a company commander a fine man with a stupid and happy expression the same man who had rushed out of the wattle shed at that moment he was clearly thinking of nothing but how dashing a fellow he would appear as he passed the commander 
 with the of a man on parade he stepped lightly with his muscular legs as if sailing along stretching himself to his full height without the smallest effort his ease contrasting with the heavy tread of the soldiers who were keeping step with him he carried close to his leg a narrow unsheathed sword small curved and not like a real weapon and looked now at the superior officers and now back at the men without losing step his whole powerful body turning flexibly it was as if all the powers of his soul were concentrated on passing the commander in the best possible manner and feeling that he was doing it well he was happy left left left he seemed to repeat to himself at each alternate step and in time to this with stern but varied faces the wall of soldiers burdened with knapsacks and muskets marched in step and each one of these hundreds of soldiers seemed to be repeating to himself at each alternate step left left left a fat major skirted a bush puffing and falling out of step a soldier who had fallen behind his face showing alarm at his defection ran at a trot panting to catch up with his company a cannon ball cleaving the air flew over the heads of bagration and his suite and fell into the column to the measure of left left close up came the company voice in jaunty tones the soldiers passed in a semicircle round something where the ball had fallen and an old trooper on the flank a noncommissioned officer who had stopped beside the dead men ran to catch up his line and falling into step with a hop looked back angrily and through the ominous silence and the regular tramp of feet beating the ground in unison one seemed to hear left left left 
 well done lads said prince bagration 
 glad to do our best your came a confused shout from the ranks a morose soldier marching on the left turned his eyes on bagration as he shouted with an expression that seemed to say we know that ourselves another without looking round as though fearing to relax shouted with his mouth wide open and passed on 
 the order was given to halt and down knapsacks 
 bagration rode round the ranks that had marched past him and dismounted he gave the reins to a cossack took off and handed over his felt coat stretched his legs and set his cap straight the head of the french column with its officers leading appeared from below the hill 
 forward with god said bagration in a resolute sonorous voice turning for a moment to the front line and slightly swinging his arms he went forward uneasily over the rough field with the awkward gait of a cavalryman prince andrew felt that an invisible power was leading him forward and experienced great happiness 
 the french were already near prince andrew walking beside bagration could clearly distinguish their bandoliers red epaulets and even their faces he distinctly saw an old french officer who with gaitered legs and toes climbed the hill with difficulty prince bagration gave no further orders and silently continued to walk on in front of the ranks suddenly one shot after another rang out from the french smoke appeared all along their uneven ranks and musket shots sounded several of our men fell among them the officer who had marched so gaily and complacently but at the moment the first report was heard bagration looked round and shouted hurrah 
 hurrah ah ah rang a shout from our ranks and passing bagration and racing one another they rushed in an irregular but joyous and eager crowd down the hill at their disordered foe

 chapter 
 
 while laurie and amy were taking conjugal strolls over velvet carpets as they set their house in order and planned a blissful future mr bhaer and jo were enjoying promenades of a different sort along muddy roads and sodden fields 
 
 i always do take a walk toward evening and i know why i should give it up just because i happen to meet the professor on his way out said jo to herself after two or three encounters for though there were two paths to whichever one she took she was sure to meet him either going or returning 
 he was always walking rapidly and never seemed to see her until quite close when he would look as if his eyes had failed to recognize the approaching lady till that moment then if she was going to he always had something for the babies if her face was turned homeward he had merely strolled down to see the river and was just returning unless they were tired of his frequent calls 
 
 under the circumstances what could jo do but greet him civilly and invite him in if she was tired of his visits she concealed her weariness with perfect skill and took care that there should be coffee for supper as mean mr like tea 
 
 by the second week everyone knew perfectly well what was going on yet everyone tried to look as if they were to the changes in face they never asked why she sang about her work did up her hair three times a day and got so blooming with her evening exercise and no one seemed to have the slightest suspicion that professor bhaer while talking philosophy with the father was giving the daughter lessons in love 
 
 jo even lose her heart in a decorous manner but sternly tried to quench her feelings and failing to do so led a somewhat agitated life she was mortally afraid of being laughed at for surrendering after her many and vehement declarations of independence laurie was her especial dread but thanks to the new manager he behaved with praiseworthy propriety never called mr bhaer a capital old fellow in public never alluded in the remotest manner to improved appearance or expressed the least surprise at seeing the hat on the marches table nearly every evening but he exulted in private and longed for the time to come when he could give jo a piece of plate with a bear and a ragged staff on it as an appropriate coat of arms 
 
 for a fortnight the professor came and went with regularity then he stayed away for three whole days and made no sign a proceeding which caused everybody to look sober and jo to become pensive at first and for cross 
 
 disgusted i dare say and gone home as suddenly as he came nothing tome of course but i should think he would have come and bid us goodbye like a gentleman she said to herself with a despairing look at the gate as she put on her things for the customary walk one dull afternoon 
 
 better take the little umbrella dear it looks like rain said her mother observing that she had on her new bonnet but not alluding to the fact 
 yes marmee do you want anything in town got to run in and get some paper returned jo pulling out the bow under her chin before the glass as an excuse for not looking at her mother 
 
 yes i want some twilled silesia a paper of number nine needles and two yards of narrow lavender ribbon have you got your thick boots on and something warm under your cloak 
 
 i believe so answered jo absently 
 
 if you happen to meet mr bhaer bring him home to tea i quite long to see the dear man added mrs march 
 
 jo heard that but made no answer except to kiss her mother and walk rapidly away thinking with a glow of gratitude in spite of her heartache how good she is to me what do girls do who any mothers to help them through their troubles 
 
 the stores were not down among the banks and wholesale warerooms where gentlemen most do congregate but jo found herself in that part of the city before she did a single errand loitering along as if waiting for someone examining engineering instruments in one window and samples of wool in another with most unfeminine interest tumbling over by descending bales and hustled unceremoniously by busy men who looked as if they wondered how the deuce she got there a drop of rain on her cheek recalled her thoughts from baffled hopes to ruined ribbons for the drops continued to fall and being a woman as well as a lover she felt that though it was too late to save her heart she might her bonnet now she remembered the little umbrella which she had forgotten to take in her hurry to be off but regret was unavailing and nothing could be done but borrow one or submit to to a drenching she looked up at the lowering sky down at the crimson bow already flecked with black forward along the muddy street then one long lingering look behind at a certain grimy warehouse with hoffmann swartz co over the door and said to herself with a sternly reproachful air 
 
 it serves me right what business had i to put on all my best things and come philandering down here hoping to see the professor jo ashamed of you no you shall not go there to borrow an umbrella or find out where he is from his friends you shall trudge away and do your errands in the rain and if you catch your death and ruin your bonnet no more than you deserve now then 
 
 with that she rushed across the street so impetuously that she narrowly escaped annihilation from a passing truck and precipitated herself into the arms of a stately old gentleman who said i beg pardon and looked mortally offended somewhat daunted jo righted herself spread her handkerchief over the devoted ribbons and putting temptation behind her hurried on with increasing dampness about the ankles and much clashing of umbrellas overhead the fact that a somewhat dilapidated blue one remained stationary above the unprotected bonnet attracted her attention and looking up she saw mr bhaer looking down 
 
 i feel to know the lady who goes so bravely under many horse noses and so fast through much mus what do you down here my friend 
 
 shopping 
 mr bhaer smiled as he glanced from the pickle factory on one side to the wholesale hide and leather concern on the other but her only said politely you haf no umbrella may i go also and take for you the bundles 
 
 yes thank you 
 cheeks were as red as her ribbon and she wondered what he thought of her but she care for in a minute she found herself walking away arm in arm with her professor feeling as if the sun had suddenly burst out with uncommon brilliancy that the world was all right again and that one thoroughly happy woman was paddling through the wet that day 
 
 we thought you had gone said jo hastily for she knew he was looking at her her bonnet big enough to hide her face and she feared he might think the joy it betrayed unmaidenly 
 
 did you believe that i should go with no farewell to those who haf been so heavenly kind tome he asked so reproachfully that she felt as if she had insulted him by the suggestion and answered heartily 
 
 no i i knew you were busy about your own affairs but we rather missed you father and mother especially 
 
 and you 
 
 always glad to see you sir 
 
 in her anxiety to keep her voice quite calm jo made it rather cool and the frosty little monosyllable at the end seemed to chill the professor for his smile vanished as he said gravely 
 
 i thank you and come one more time before i go 
 
 you are going then 
 
 i haf no longer any business here it is done 
 
 successfully i hope said jo for the bitterness of disappointment was in that short reply of his 
 
 i ought to think so for i haf a way opened to me by which i can make my bread and gif my junglings much help 
 
 tell me please i like to know all about boys said jo eagerly 
 
 that is so kind i gladly tell you my friends find for mea place in a college where i teach as at home and earn enough to make the way smooth for franz and emil for this i should be grateful should i not 
 
 indeed you should how splendid it will be to have you doing what you like and be able to see you often and the boys cried jo clinging to the lads as an excuse for the satisfaction she could not help betraying 
 
 ah but we shall not meet often i fear this place is at the west 
 
 so far away and jo left her skirts to their fate as if it matter now what became of her clothes or herself 
 
 mr bhaer could read several languages but he had not learned to read women yet he flattered himself that he knew jo pretty well and was therefore much amazed by the contradictions of voice face and manner which she showed him in rapid succession that day for she was in half a dozen different moods in the course of half an hour when she met him she looked surprised though it was impossible to help suspecting that she had come for that express purpose when he offered her his arm she took it with a look that filled him with delight but when he asked if she missed him she gave such fell upon him on learning his good fortune she almost clappedherhands was the joy all for the boys then on hearing his destination she said so far away in a tone of despair that lifted him on to a pinnacle of hope but the next minute she tumbled him down again by observing like one entirely absorbed in the matter 
 
 the place for my errands will you come in it take long 
 
 jo rather prided herself upon her shopping capabilities and particularly wished to impress her escort with the neatness and dispatch with which she would accomplish the business but owing to the flutter she was in everything went amiss she upset the tray of needles forgot the silesia was to be twilled till it was cut off gave the wrong change and covered herself with confusion by asking for lavender ribbon at the calico counter mr bhaer stood by watching her blush and blunder and as he watched his own bewilderment seemed to subside for he was beginning to see that on some occasions women like dreams go by contraries 
 
 when they came out he put the parcel under his arm with a more cheerful aspect and splashed through the puddles as if he rather enjoyed it on the whole 
 
 should we no do a little what you call shopping for the babies and haf a farewell feast tonight if i go for my last call at your so pleasant home he asked stopping before a window full of fruit and flowers 
 
 what will we buy asked jo ignoring the latter part of his speech and sniffing the mingled odors with an affectation of delight as they went in 
 
 may they haf oranges and figs asked mr bhaer with a paternal air 
 
 they eat them when they can get them 
 do you care for nuts 
 
 like a squirrel 
 
 hamburg grapes yes we shall drink to the fatherland in those 
 
 jo frowned upon that piece of extravagance and asked why he buy a frail of dated a cask of raisins and a bag of almonds and be done with it whereat mr bhaer confiscated her purse produced his own and finished the marketing by buying several pounds of grapes a pot of rosy daisies and a pretty jar of honey to be regarded in the light of a demijohn then distorting his pockets with knobby bundles and giving her the flowers to hold he put up the old umbrella and they traveled on again 
 
 miss marsch i haf a great favor to ask of you began the professor after a moist promenade of half a block 
 
 yes sir and heart began to beat so hard she was afraid he would hear it 
 
 i am bold to say it in spite of the rain because so short a time remains to me 
 
 yes sir and jo nearly crushed the small flowerpot with the sudden squeeze she gave it 
 
 i wish to get a little dress for my tina and i am too stupid to go alone will you kindly gif me a word of taste and help 
 
 yes sir and jo felt as calm and cool all of a sudden as if she had stepped into a refrigerator 
 
 perhaps also a shawl for mother she is so poor and sick and the husband is such a care yes yes a thick warm shawl would be a friendly thing to take the little mother 
 
 do it with pleasure mr bhaer going very fast and getting dearer every minute added jo to herself then with a mental shake she entered into the business with an energy that was pleasant to behold mr bhaer left it all to her so she chose a pretty gown for tina and then ordered out the shawls the clerk being a married man condescended to take an interest in the couple who appeared to be shopping for their family 
 
 your lady may prefer this a superior article a most desirable color quite chaste and genteel he said shaking out a comfortable gray shawl and throwing it over shoulders 
 
 does this suit you mr bhaer she asked turning her back to him and feeling deeply grateful for the chance of hiding her face excellently well we will haf it answered the professor smiling to himself as he paid for it while jo continued to rummage the counters like a confirmed 
 
 now shall we go home he asked as if the words were very pleasant to him 
 
 yes late and so tired voice was more pathetic than she knew for now the sun seemed to have gone in as suddenly as it came out and the world grew muddy and miserable again and for the first time she discovered that her feet were cold her head ached and that her heart was colder than the former fuller of pain than the latter mr bhaer was going away he only cared for her as a friend it was all a mistake and the sooner it was over the better with this idea in her head she hailed an approaching omnibus with such a hasty gesture that the daisies flew out of the pot and were badly damaged 
 
 this is not our omniboos said the professor waving the loaded vehicle away and stopping to pick up the poor little flowers 
 
 i beg your pardon i see the name distinctly never mind i can walk used to plodding in the mud returned jo winking hard because she would have died rather than openly wipe her eyes mr bhaer saw the drops on her cheeks though she turned her head away the sight seemed to touch him very much for suddenly stooping down he asked in a tone that meant a great deal dearest why do you cry 
 
 now if jo had not been new to this sort of thing she would have said she crying had a cold in her head or told any other feminine fib proper to the occasion instead of which that undignified creature answered with an irrepressible sob because you are going away 
 
 ach mein gott that is so good cried mr bhaer managing to clasp his hands in spite of the umbrella and the bundles jo i haf nothing but much love to gif you i came to see if you could care for it and i waited to be sure that i was something more than a friend am i can you make a little place in your heart for old fritz he added all in one breath 
 
 oh yes said jo and he was quite satisfied for she folded both hands over his are and looked up at him with an expression that plainly showed how happy she would be to walk through life beside him even though she had no better shelter than the old umbrella if he carried it 
 
 it was certainly proposing under difficulties for even if he had desired to do so mr bhaer could not go down upon his knees on account of the mud neither could he offer jo his hand except figuratively for both were full much less could he indulge in tender remonstrations in the open street though he was near it so the only way in which he could express his rapture was to look at her with an expression which glorified his face to such a degree that there actually seemed to be little rainbows in the drops that sparkled on his beard if he had not loved jo very much i think he could have doneit then for she looked far from lovely with her skirts in a deplorable state her rubber boots splashed to the ankle and her bonnet a ruin fortunately mr bhaer considered her the most beautiful woman living and she found him more than ever though his hatbrim was quite limp with the little rills trickling thence upon his shoulders for he held the umbrella all over jo and every finger of his gloves needed mending 
 
 probably thought them a pair of harmless lunatics for they entirely forgot to hail a bus and strolledleisurely along oblivious of deepening dusk and fog little they cared what anybody thought for they were enjoying the happy hour that seldom comes but once in any life the magical moment which bestows youth on the old beauty on the plain wealth on the poor and gives human hearts a foretaste of heaven the professor looked as if he had conquered a kingdom and the world had nothing more to offer him in the way of bliss while jo trudged beside him feeling as if her place had always been there and wondering how she ever could have chosen any other lot of course she was the first to i mean for the emotional remarks which followed her impetuous 
 oh yes were not of a coherent or reportable character 
 
 friedrich why you 
 
 ah heaven she gifs me the name that no one speaks since minna died cried the professor pausing in a puddle to regard her with grateful delight 
 
 i always call you so to forgot but i unless you like it 
 
 like it it is more sweet to me than i can tell say thou also and i shall say your language is almost as beautiful as mine 
 
 thou a little sentimental asked jo privately thinking it a lovely monosyllable 
 
 sentimental yes thank gott we germans believe in sentiment and keep ourselves young mit it your english you is so cold say thou dearest it means so much to me pleaded mr bhaer more like a romantic student than a grave professor 
 
 well then why thou tell me all this sooner asked jo bashfully 
 
 now i shall haf to show thee all my heart and i so gladly will because thou must take care of it hereafter see then the dear funny little had a wish to tell something the day i said goodbye in new york but i thought the handsome friend was betrothed to thee and so i spoke not wouldst thou have said yes then if i had spoken 
 
 i know afraid not for i have any heart just then 
 
 prut that i do not believe it was asleep till the fairy prince came through the wood and waked it up ah well die erste liebe ist die beste but that i should not expect 
 
 yes the first love is the best but be so contented for i never had another teddy was only a boy and soon got over his little fancy said jo anxious to correct the mistake 
 
 good then i shall rest happy and be sure that thou givest me all i haf waited so long i am grown selfish as thou wiltfind professorin 
 
 i like that cried jo delighted with her new name now tell me what brought you at last just when i wanted you 
 
 this and mr bhaer took a little worn paper out of his waistcoat pocket 
 
 jo unfolded it and looked much abashed for it was one of her own contributions to a paper that paid for poetry which accounted for her sending it an occasional attempt 
 
 how could that bring you she asked wondering what he meant 
 
 i found it by chance i knew it by the names and the initials and in it there was one little verse that seemed to call me read and find him i will see that you go not in the wet 
 
 in the garret four little chests all in a row dim with dust and worn by time all fashioned and filled long ago by children now in their prime four little keys hung side by side with faded ribbons brave and gay when fastened there with childish pride long ago on a rainy day four little names one on each lid carved out by a boyish hand and underneath there lieth hid histories of the happpy band once playing here and pausing oft to hear the sweet refrain that came and went on the roof aloft in the falling summer rain 
 
 meg on the first lid smooth and fair i look in with loving eyes for folded here with care a goodly gathering lies the record of a peaceful life gifts to gentle child and girl a bridal gown lines to a wife a tiny shoe a baby curl no toys in this first chest remain for all are carried away in their old age to join again in another small play ah happy mother well i know you hear like a sweet refrain lullabies ever soft and low in the falling summer rain 
 
 jo on the next lid scratched and worn and within a motley store of headless dolls of schoolbooks torn birds and beasts that speak no more spoils brought home from the fairy ground only trod by youthful feet dreams of a future never found memories of a past still sweet poems stories wild april letters warm and cold diaries of a wilful child hints of a woman early old a woman in a lonely home hearing like a sad refrain be worthy love and love will come in the falling summer rain 
 
 my beth the dust is always swept from the lid that bears your name as if by loving eyes that wept by careful hands that often came death cannonized for us one saint ever less human than divine and still we lay with tender plaint relics in this household shrine the silver bell so seldom rung the little cap which last she wore the fair dead catherine that hung by angels borne above her door the songs she sang without lament in her of pain forever are they sweetly blent with the falling summer rain 
 
 upon the last polished field legend now both fair and true a gallant knight bears on his shield amy in letters gold and blue within lie snoods that bound her hair slippers that have danced their last faded flowers laid by with care fans whose airy toils are past gay valentines all ardent flames trifles that have borne their part in girlish hopes and fears and shames the record of a maiden heart now learning fairer truer spells hearing like a blithe refrain the silver sound of bridal bells in the falling summer rain 
 
 four little chests all in a row dim with dust and worn by time four women taught by weal and woe to love and labor in their prime four sisters parted for an hour none lost one only gone before made by immortal power nearest and dearest evermore oh when these hidden stores of ours lie open to the sight may they be rich in golden hours deeds that show fairer for the light lives whose brave music long shall ring like a strain souls that shall gladly soar and sing in the long sunshine after rain 
 
 very bad poetry but i felt it when i wrote it one day when i was very lonely and had a good cry on a rag bag i never thought it would go where it could tell tales said jo tearing up the verses the professor had treasured so long 
 
 let it go it has done duty and i will haf a fresh one when i read all the brown book in which she keeps her little secrets said mr bhaer with a smile as he watched the fragments fly away on the wind yes he added earnestly i read that and i think to myself she has a sorrow she is lonely she would find comfort in true love i haf a heart full full for her shall i not go and say if this is not too poor a thing to gif for what i shall hope to receive take it in name 
 
 and so you came to find that it was not too poor but the one precious thing i needed whispered jo 
 
 i had no courage to think that at first heavenly kind as was your welcome to me but soon i began to hope and then i said i will haf her if i die for it and so i will cried mr bhaer with a defiant nod as if the walls of mist closing round them were barriers which he was to surmount or valiantly knock down 
 
 jo thought that was splendid and resolved to be worthy of her knight though he did not come prancing on a charger in gorgeous array 
 
 what made you stay away so long she asked presently finding it so pleasant to ask confidential questions and get delightful answers that she could not keep silent 
 
 it was not easy but i could not find the heart to take you from that so happy home until i could haf a prospect of one to gif you after much time perhaps and hard work how could i ask you to gif up so much for a poor old fellow who has no fortune but a little learning 
 
 glad you are poor i bear a rich husband said jo decidedly adding in a softer tone fear poverty known it long enough to lose my dread and be happy working for those i love and call yourself is the prime of life i help loving you if you were seventy 
 
 the professor found that so touching that he would have been glad of his handkerchief if he could have got at it as her jo wiped his eyes for him and said laughing as she took away a bundle or two 
 
 i may be but no one can say out of my sphere now for special mission is supposed to be drying tears and bearing burdens to carry my share friedrich and help to earn the home make up your mind to that or never go she added resolutely as he tried to reclaim his load 
 
 we shall see haf you patience to wait a long time jo i must go away and do my work alone i must help my boys first because even for you i may not break my word to minna can you forgif that and be happy while we hope and wait 
 yes i know i can for we love one another and that makes all the rest easy to bear i have my duty also and my work i enjoy myself if i neglected them even for you so no need of hurry or impatience you can do your part out west i can do mine here and both be happy hoping for the best and leaving the future to be as god wills 
 ah thou gifest me such hope and courage and i haf nothing to gif back but a full heart and these empty hands cried the professor quite overcome 
 jo never never would learn to be proper for when he said that as they stood upon the steps she just put both hands into his whispering tenderly not empty now and stooping down kissed her friedrich under the umbrella it was dreadful but she would have done it if the flock of sparrows on the hedge had been human beings for she was very far gone indeed and quite regardless of everything but her own happiness though it came in such a very simple guise that was the crowning moment of both their lives when turning from the night and storm and loneliness to the household light and warmth and peace waiting to receive them with a glad welcome home jo led her lover in and shut the door

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the dryad 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 we are travelling to paris to the exhibition 
 
 now we are there that was a journey a flight without magic we 
 flew on the wings of steam over the sea and across the land 
 
 yes our time is the time of fairy tales 
 
 we are in the midst of paris in a great hotel blooming flowers 
 ornament the staircases and soft carpets the floors 
 
 our room is a very cosy one and through the open balcony door 
 we have a view of a great square spring lives down there it has come to paris and arrived at the same time with us it has come in the 
 shape of a glorious young chestnut tree with delicate leaves newly 
 opened how the tree gleams dressed in its spring garb before all 
 the other trees in the place one of these latter had been struck 
 out of the list of living trees it lies on the ground with roots 
 exposed on the place where it stood the young chestnut tree is to be 
 planted and to flourish 
 
 it still stands towering aloft on the heavy wagon which has 
 brought it this morning a distance of several miles to paris for 
 years it had stood there in the protection of a mighty oak tree 
 under which the old venerable clergyman had often sat with children 
 listening to his stories 
 
 the young chestnut tree had also listened to the stories for 
 the dryad who lived in it was a child also she remembered the time 
 when the tree was so little that it only projected a short way above 
 the grass and ferns around these were as tall as they would ever 
 be but the tree grew every year and enjoyed the air and the 
 sunshine and drank the dew and the rain several times it was also 
 as it must be well shaken by the wind and the rain for that is a 
 part of education 
 
 the dryad rejoiced in her life and rejoiced in the sunshine 
 and the singing of the birds but she was most rejoiced at human 
 voices she understood the language of men as well as she understood that of animals 
 
 butterflies cockchafers everything that could 
 fly came to pay a visit they could all talk they told of the 
 village of the vineyard of the forest of the old castle with its 
 parks and canals and ponds down in the water dwelt also living 
 beings which in their way could fly under the water from one 
 place to another beings with knowledge and delineation they said 
 nothing at all they were so clever 
 
 and the swallow who had dived told about the pretty little 
 goldfish of the thick turbot the fat brill and the old carp the 
 swallow could describe all that very well but self is the man she 
 said one ought to see these things self but how was the 
 dryad ever to see such beings she was obliged to be satisfied with 
 being able to look over the beautiful country and see the busy 
 industry of men 
 
 it was glorious but most glorious of all when the old clergyman 
 sat under the oak tree and talked of france and of the great deeds of 
 her sons and daughters whose names will be mentioned with 
 admiration through all time 
 
 then the dryad heard of the shepherd girl joan of arc and of 
 charlotte corday she heard about henry the fourth and napoleon the first she heard names whose echo sounds in the hearts of the people 
 
 the village children listened attentively and the dryad no less 
 attentively she became a with the rest in the clouds 
 that went sailing by she saw picture by picture everything that 
 she heard talked about the cloudy sky was her 
 she felt so happy in beautiful france the fruitful land of 
 genius with the crater of freedom but in her heart the sting 
 remained that the bird that every animal that could fly was much 
 better off than she even the fly could look about more in the 
 world far beyond the horizon 
 
 france was so great and so glorious but she could only look 
 across a little piece of it the land stretched out 
 with vineyards forests and great cities of all these paris was the 
 most splendid and the mightiest the birds could get there but she 
 never 
 
 among the village children was a little ragged poor girl but a 
 pretty one to look at she was always laughing or singing and 
 twining red flowers in her black hair 
 
 go to paris the old clergyman warned her poor child if 
 you go there it will be your ruin 
 
 but she went for all that 
 
 the dryad often thought of her for she had the same wish and 
 felt the same longing for the great city 
 the tree was bearing its first chestnut blossoms the 
 birds were twittering round them in the most beautiful sunshine 
 then a stately carriage came rolling along that way and in it sat a 
 grand lady driving the spirited horses on the back seat 
 a little smart groom balanced himself the dryad knew the lady and 
 the old clergyman knew her also he shook his head gravely when he saw her and said 
 
 so you went there after all and it was your ruin poor mary 
 that one poor thought the dryad no she wears a dress fit for 
 a countess she had become one in the city of magic changes oh if i were only there amid all the splendor and pomp they shine up 
 into the very clouds at night when i look up i can tell in what 
 direction the town lies 
 
 towards that direction the dryad looked every evening she saw 
 in the dark night the gleaming cloud on the horizon in the clear 
 moonlight nights she missed the sailing clouds which showed her 
 pictures of the city and pictures from history 
 
 the child grasps at the the dryad grasped at the 
 her a sudden cloudless sky was for her a blank leaf and for several days she had only had such leaves before 
 her 
 
 it was in the warm not a breeze moved through the 
 glowing hot days every leaf every flower lay as if it were 
 torpid and the people seemed torpid too 
 
 then the clouds arose and covered the region round about where the 
 gleaming mist announced here lies paris 
 
 the clouds piled themselves up like a chain of mountains 
 hurried on through the air and spread themselves abroad over the 
 whole landscape as far as the eye could reach 
 
 like enormous blocks of rock the clouds lay piled over 
 one another gleams of lightning shot forth from them 
 
 these also are the servants of the lord god the old clergyman 
 had said and there came a bluish dazzling flash of lightning a 
 lighting up as if of the sun itself which could burst blocks of 
 rock asunder the lightning struck and split to the roots the old 
 venerable oak the crown fell asunder it seemed as if the tree were 
 stretching forth its arms to clasp the messengers of the light 
 
 no bronze cannon can sound over the land at the birth of a royal 
 child as the thunder sounded at the death of the old oak the rain 
 streamed down a refreshing wind was blowing the storm had gone by and there was quite a holiday glow on all things the old clergyman spoke a few words for honorable remembrance and a painter made a drawing as a lasting record of the tree 
 
 everything passes away said the dryad passes away like a 
 cloud and never comes back 
 
 the old clergyman too did not come back the green roof of his 
 school was gone and his had vanished the children did not come but autumn came and winter came and then spring also in all this change of seasons the dryad looked toward the region where at night paris gleamed with its bright mist far on the horizon 
 
 forth from the town rushed engine after engine train after train 
 whistling and screaming at all hours in the day in the evening 
 towards midnight at daybreak and all the day through came the 
 trains out of each one and into each one streamed people from the 
 country of every king a new wonder of the world had summoned them to paris 
 
 in what form did this wonder exhibit itself 
 a splendid blossom of art and industry said one has 
 unfolded itself in the champ de mars a gigantic sunflower from whose petals one can learn geography and statistics and can become as wise as a lord mayor and raise self to the level of art and 
 poetry and study the greatness and power of the various lands 
 a fairy tale flower said another a which spreads out its green leaves like a velvet carpet over the sand the opening spring has brought it forth the summer will see it in all its splendor the autumn winds will sweep it away so that not a leaf not a fragment of its root shall remain 
 in front of the military school extends in time of peace the arena 
 of war a field without a blade of grass a piece of sandy steppe 
 as if cut out of the desert of africa where fata morgana displays her 
 wondrous airy castles and hanging gardens in the champ de mars 
 however these were to be seen more splendid more wonderful than in the east for human art had converted the airy deceptive scenes into reality 
 
 the palace of the present has been built it was said 
 
 day by day hour by hour it unfolds more of its wonderful splendor 
 
 the endless halls shine in marble and many colors master 
 bloodless here moves his limbs of steel and iron in the great 
 circular hall of machinery works of art in metal in stone in 
 gobelins tapestry announce the vitality of mind that is stirring in 
 every land halls of paintings splendor of flowers everything that 
 mind and skill can create in the workshop of the artisan has been 
 placed here for show even the memorials of ancient days out of old 
 graves and have appeared at this general meeting 
 the overpowering great variegated whole must be divided into small 
 portions and pressed together like a plaything if it is to be 
 understood and described 
 
 like a great table on christmas eve the champ de mars carried a 
 of industry and art and around this knickknacks from 
 all countries had been ranged knickknacks on a grand scale for every nation found some remembrance of home 
 
 here stood the royal palace of egypt there the caravanserai of 
 the desert land the bedouin had quitted his sunny country and 
 hastened by on his camel here stood the russian stables with the 
 fiery glorious horses of the steppe here stood the simple 
 dwelling of the danish peasant with the dannebrog 
 flag next to gustavus wooden house from dalarne with its 
 wonderful carvings american huts english cottages french pavilions kiosks theatres churches all strewn around and between them the fresh green turf the clear springing water blooming bushes rare trees hothouses in which one might fancy self transported into the tropical forest whole gardens brought from damascus and blooming under one roof what colors what fragrance 
 
 artificial grottoes surrounded bodies of fresh or salt water 
 and gave a glimpse into the empire of the fishes the visitor seemed 
 to wander at the bottom of the sea among fishes and polypi 
 all this they said the champ de mars offers and around 
 the great table the crowd of human beings moves like a 
 busy swarm of ants on foot or in little carriages for not all feet 
 are equal to such a fatiguing journey 
 
 hither they swarm from morning till late in the evening steamer 
 after steamer crowded with people glides down the seine the 
 number of carriages is continually on the increase the swarm of 
 people on foot and on horseback grows more and more dense carriages and omnibuses are crowded stuffed and embroidered with people all these tributary streams flow in one direction towards the exhibition 
 
 on every entrance the flag of france is displayed around the 
 bazaar wave the flags of all nations there is a humming and a 
 murmuring from the hall of the machines from the towers the melody of the chimes is heard with the tones of the organs in the churches 
 mingle the hoarse nasal songs from the cafes of the east it is a 
 kingdom of babel a wonder of the world 
 
 in very truth it was what all the reports said and who 
 did not hear them the dryad knew everything that is told here of 
 the new wonder in the city of cities 
 
 fly away ye birds fly away to see and then come back and 
 tell me said the dryad 
 
 the wish became an intense desire became the one thought of a 
 life then in the quiet silent night while the full moon was 
 shining the dryad saw a spark fly out of the disc and fall 
 like a shooting star and before the tree whose leaves waved to and 
 fro as if they were stirred by a tempest stood a noble mighty and 
 grand figure in tones that were at once rich and strong like the 
 trumpet of the last judgment bidding farewell to life and summoning to the great account it said 
 
 thou shalt go to the city of magic thou shalt take root there 
 and enjoy the mighty rushing breezes the air and the sunshine 
 there but the time of thy life shall then be shortened the line of 
 years that awaited thee here amid the free nature shall shrink to 
 but a small tale poor dryad it shall be thy destruction thy 
 yearning and longing will increase thy desire will grow more 
 stormy the tree itself will be as a prison to thee thou wilt quit 
 thy cell and give up thy nature to fly out and mingle among men 
 then the years that would have belonged to thee will be contracted 
 to half the span of the ephemeral fly that lives but a day one 
 night and thy shall be blown out the leaves of the tree 
 will wither and be blown away to become green never again 
 thus the words sounded and the light vanished away but not the 
 longing of the dryad she trembled in the wild fever of expectation 
 i shall go there she cried rejoicingly life is beginning and 
 swells like a cloud nobody knows whither it is hastening 
 when the gray dawn arose and the moon turned pale and the clouds 
 were tinted red the hour struck the words of promise were fulfilled 
 
 people appeared with spades and poles they dug round the roots of 
 the tree deeper and deeper and beneath it a wagon was brought 
 out drawn by many horses and the tree was lifted up with its 
 roots and the lumps of earth that adhered to them matting was 
 placed around the roots as though the tree had its feet in a warm 
 bag and now the tree was lifted on the wagon and secured with chains 
 
 the journey began the journey to paris there the tree was to grow as an ornament to the city of french glory 
 
 the twigs and the leaves of the chestnut tree trembled in the 
 first moments of its being moved and the dryad trembled in the 
 pleasurable feeling of expectation 
 
 away away it sounded in every beat of her pulse away 
 away sounded in words that flew trembling along the dryad forgot 
 to bid farewell to the regions of home she thought not of the 
 waving grass and of the innocent daisies which had looked up to her 
 as to a great lady a young princess playing at being a shepherdess 
 out in the open air 
 
 the chestnut tree stood upon the wagon and nodded his branches 
 whether this meant farewell or forward the dryad knew not she 
 dreamed only of the marvellous new things that seemed yet so 
 familiar and that were to unfold themselves before her no 
 heart rejoicing in innocence no heart whose blood danced with 
 passion had set out on the journey to paris more full of 
 expectation than she 
 
 her farewell sounded in the words away away 
 the wheels turned the distant approached the present vanished 
 the region was changed even as the clouds change new vineyards 
 forests villages villas appeared came nearer vanished 
 
 the chestnut tree moved forward and the dryad went with it 
 after rushed past sending up into the air 
 vapory clouds that formed figures which told of paris whence they 
 came and whither the dryad was going 
 
 everything around knew it and must know whither she was bound it 
 seemed to her as if every tree she passed stretched out its leaves 
 towards her with the prayer take me with you take me with you 
 for every tree enclosed a longing dryad 
 
 what changes during this flight houses seemed to be rising out of 
 the earth more and more thicker and thicker the chimneys rose 
 like ranged side by side or in rows one above the 
 other on the roofs great inscriptions in letters a yard long and 
 figures in various colors covering the walls from cornice to 
 basement came brightly out 
 
 where does paris begin and when shall i be there asked the 
 dryad 
 
 the crowd of people grew the tumult and the bustle increased 
 carriage followed upon carriage people on foot and people on 
 horseback were mingled together all around were shops on shops music and song crying and talking 
 
 the dryad in her tree was now in the midst of paris the great 
 heavy wagon all at once stopped on a little square planted with trees 
 the high houses around had all of them balconies to the windows 
 from which the inhabitants looked down upon the young fresh chestnut tree which was coming to be planted here as a substitute for the dead tree that lay stretched on the ground 
 
 the stood still and smiled in admiration of its pure 
 vernal freshness the older trees whose buds were still closed 
 whispered with their waving branches welcome welcome the 
 fountain throwing its jet of water high up in the air to let it fall 
 again in the wide stone basin told the wind to sprinkle the 
 with pearly drops as if it wished to give him a refreshing draught to 
 welcome him 
 
 the dryad felt how her tree was being lifted from the wagon to 
 be placed in the spot where it was to stand the roots were covered 
 with earth and fresh turf was laid on top blooming shrubs and 
 flowers in pots were ranged around and thus a little garden arose 
 in the square 
 
 the tree that had been killed by the fumes of gas the steam of 
 kitchens and the bad air of the city was put upon the wagon and 
 driven away the looked on children and old men sat upon the bench and looked at the green tree and we who are telling this story stood upon a balcony and looked down upon the green spring sight that had been brought in from the fresh country air and said what the old clergyman would have said poor dryad 
 
 i am happy i am happy the dryad cried rejoicing and yet i 
 cannot realize cannot describe what i feel everything is as i 
 fancied it and yet as i did not fancy it 
 
 the houses stood there so lofty so close the sunlight shone 
 on only one of the walls and that one was stuck over with bills and 
 placards before which the people stood still and this made a crowd 
 carriages rushed past carriages rolled past light ones and heavy 
 ones mingled together omnibuses those moving houses came rattling by horsemen galloped among them even carts and wagons asserted their rights 
 
 the dryad asked herself if these houses which stood so 
 close around her would not remove and take other shapes like the 
 clouds in the sky and draw aside so that she might cast a glance 
 into paris and over it notre dame must show itself the vendome 
 column and the wondrous building which had called and was still 
 calling so many strangers to the city 
 
 but the houses did not stir from their places it was yet day when 
 the lamps were lit the gleamed from the shops and shone 
 even into the branches of the trees so that it was like sunlight in 
 summer the stars above made their appearance the same to which the dryad had looked up in her home she thought she felt a clear pure stream of air which went forth from them she felt herself lifted up and strengthened and felt an increased power of seeing through 
 every leaf and through every fibre of the root amid all the noise and 
 the turmoil the colors and the lights she knew herself watched by 
 mild eyes 
 
 from the side streets sounded the merry notes of fiddles and 
 wind instruments up to the dance to the dance to jollity and 
 pleasure that was their invitation such music it was that horses 
 carriages trees and houses would have danced if they had known how 
 
 the charm of intoxicating delight filled the bosom of the dryad 
 
 how glorious how splendid it is she cried rejoicingly now i 
 am in paris 
 
 the next day that dawned the next night that fell offered the 
 same spectacle similar bustle similar life changing indeed yet 
 always the same and thus it went on through the sequence of days 
 now i know every tree every flower on the square here i know 
 every house every balcony every shop in this narrow 
 corner where i am denied the sight of this great mighty city where 
 are the arches of triumph the boulevards the wondrous building of 
 the world i see nothing of all this as if shut up in a cage i stand 
 among the high houses which i now know by heart with their 
 inscriptions signs and placards all the painted confectionery that 
 is no longer to my taste where are all the things of which i heard 
 for which i longed and for whose sake i wanted to come hither what have i seized found won i feel the same longing i felt before i 
 feel that there is a life i should wish to grasp and to experience 
 i must go out into the ranks of living men and mingle among them i 
 must fly about like a bird i must see and feel and become human 
 altogether i must enjoy the one instead of vegetating for 
 years in sameness and weariness in which i become ill 
 and at last sink and disappear like the dew on the meadows i will 
 gleam like the cloud gleam in the sunshine of life look out over the 
 whole like the cloud and pass away like it no one knoweth whither 
 thus sighed the dryad and she prayed 
 
 take from me the years that were destined for me and give me but 
 half of the life of the ephemeral fly deliver me from my prison give 
 me human life human happiness only a short span only the one it cannot be otherwise and then punish me for my wish to live my longing for life strike me out of thy list let my shell the 
 fresh young tree wither or be hewn down and burnt to ashes and 
 scattered to all the winds 
 
 a rustling went through the leaves of the tree there was a 
 trembling in each of the leaves it seemed as if fire streamed through 
 it a gust of wind shook its green crown and from the midst of that 
 crown a female figure came forth in the same moment she was sitting 
 beneath the leafy branches young and beautiful 
 to behold like poor mary to whom the clergyman had said the 
 great city will be thy destruction 
 
 the dryad sat at the foot of the tree at her house door which 
 she had locked and whose key had thrown away so young so fair 
 the stars saw her and blinked at her the saw her and 
 gleamed and beckoned to her how delicate she was and yet how 
 blooming a child and yet a grown maiden her dress was fine as 
 silk green as the leaves on the crown of the tree 
 in her hair clung a chestnut blossom she looked like the goddess of spring 
 
 for one short minute she sat motionless then she sprang up 
 and light as a gazelle she hurried away she ran and sprang like the 
 reflection from the mirror that carried by the sunshine is cast now 
 here now there could any one have followed her with his eyes he 
 would have seen how marvellously her dress and her form changed 
 according to the nature of the house or the place whose light happened to shine upon her 
 
 she reached the boulevards here a sea of light streamed forth 
 from the of the lamps the shops and the cafes here 
 stood in a row young and slender trees each of which concealed its 
 dryad and gave shade from the artificial sunlight the whole vast 
 pavement was one great festive hall where covered tables stood 
 laden with refreshments of all kinds from champagne and chartreuse 
 down to coffee and beer here was an exhibition of flowers statues 
 books and colored stuffs 
 
 from the crowd close by the lofty houses she looked forth over the 
 terrific stream beyond the rows of trees yonder heaved a stream of 
 rolling carriages cabriolets coaches omnibuses cabs and among 
 them riding gentlemen and marching troops to cross to the opposite 
 shore was an undertaking fraught with danger to life and limb now 
 lanterns shed their radiance abroad now the gas had the upper hand 
 suddenly a rocket rises whence whither 
 
 here are sounds of soft italian melodies yonder spanish songs 
 are sung accompanied by the rattle of the castanets but strongest of 
 all and predominating over the rest the tunes of the 
 moment the exciting music which orpheus never knew and which was never heard by the belle helene even the barrow was tempted to hop upon one of its wheels 
 
 the dryad danced floated flew changing her color every 
 moment like a in the sunshine each house with the 
 world belonging to it gave her its own reflections 
 
 as the glowing torn from its stem is carried away 
 by the stream so the dryad drifted along whenever she paused she 
 was another being so that none was able to follow her to recognize 
 her or to look more closely at her 
 
 like all things flew by her she looked into a 
 thousand faces but not one was familiar to her she saw not a 
 single form from home two bright eyes had remained in her memory she thought of mary poor mary the ragged merry child who wore the red flowers in her black hair mary was now here in the rich and magnificent as in that day when she drove past the house of the old clergyman and past the tree of the dryad the old oak 
 
 here she was certainly living in the deafening tumult perhaps 
 she had just stepped out of one of the gorgeous carriages in 
 waiting handsome equipages with coachmen in gold braid and footmen in silken hose drove up the people who alighted from them were all ladies they went through the opened gate and ascended the broad staircase that led to a building resting on marble pillars was this building perhaps the wonder of the world 
 there mary would certainly be found 
 
 sancta maria resounded from the interior incense floated 
 through the lofty painted and gilded aisles where a solemn twilight 
 reigned 
 
 it was the church of the madeleine 
 
 clad in black garments of the most costly stuffs fashioned 
 according to the latest mode the rich feminine world of paris 
 glided across the shining pavement the crests of the proprietors were engraved on silver shields on the and embroidered in the corners of perfumed handkerchiefs bordered with brussels lace a few of the ladies were kneeling in silent prayer 
 before the altars others resorted to the confessionals 
 
 anxiety and fear took possession of the dryad she felt as if 
 she had entered a place where she had no right to be here was the 
 abode of silence the hall of secrets everything was said in 
 whispers every word was a mystery 
 
 the dryad saw herself enveloped in lace and silk like the women 
 of wealth and of high birth around her had perhaps every one of 
 them a longing in her breast like the dryad 
 
 a deep painful sigh was heard did it escape from some 
 confessional in a distant corner or from the bosom of the dryad 
 she drew the veil closer around her she breathed incense and not the 
 fresh air here was not the of her longing 
 
 away away a hastening without rest the ephemeral fly knows 
 not repose for her existence is flight 
 
 she was out again among the gas candelabra by a magnificent 
 fountain 
 
 all its streaming waters are not able to wash out the innocent 
 blood that was spilt here 
 
 such were the words spoken strangers stood around carrying on 
 a lively conversation such as no one would have dared to carry on 
 in the gorgeous hall of secrets whence the dryad came 
 
 a heavy stone slab was turned and then lifted she did not 
 understand why she saw an opening that led into the depths below 
 the strangers stepped down leaving the starlit air and the cheerful 
 life of the upper world behind them 
 
 i am afraid said one of the women who stood around to her 
 husband i cannot venture to go down nor do i care for the wonders down yonder you had better stay here with me 
 
 indeed and travel home said the man and quit paris without 
 having seen the most wonderful thing of all the real wonder of the 
 present period created by the power and resolution of one man 
 i will not go down for all that was the reply 
 
 the wonder of the present time it had been called the dryad 
 had heard and had understood it the goal of her ardent longing had 
 thus been reached and here was the entrance to it down into the 
 depths below paris she had not thought of such a thing but now she heard it said and saw the strangers descending and went after them 
 
 the staircase was of cast iron spiral broad and easy below 
 there burned a lamp and farther down another they stood in a 
 labyrinth of endless halls and arched passages all communicating with each other all the streets and lanes of paris were to be seen here 
 again as in a dim reflection the names were painted up and every 
 house above had its number down here also and struck its roots 
 under the macadamized quays of a broad canal in which the muddy water flowed onward over it the fresh streaming water was carried on arches and quite at the top hung the tangled net of and 
 
 
 in the distance lamps gleamed like a reflection from the 
 above every now and then a dull rumbling was heard this came from the heavy wagons rolling over the entrance bridges 
 
 whither had the dryad come 
 
 you have no doubt heard of the catacombs now they are vanishing points in that new underground world that wonder of the present day the sewers of paris the dryad was there and not in the 
 exhibition in the champ de mars 
 
 she heard exclamations of wonder and admiration 
 
 from here go forth health and life for thousands upon thousands 
 up yonder our time is the time of progress with its manifold 
 blessings 
 
 such was the opinion and the speech of men but not of those 
 creatures who had been born here and who built and dwelt here of the rats namely who were squeaking to one another in the clefts of a 
 crumbling wall quite plainly and in a way the dryad understood well 
 
 a big old with his tail bitten off was relieving 
 his feelings in loud squeaks and his family gave their tribute of 
 concurrence to every word he said 
 
 i am disgusted with this he cried with these 
 outbursts of ignorance a fine magnificence truly all made up of gas 
 and petroleum i eat such stuff as that everything here is so 
 fine and bright now that ashamed of self without exactly 
 knowing why ah if we only lived in the days of tallow candles and 
 it does not lie so very far behind us that was a romantic time as 
 one may say 
 
 what are you talking of there asked the dryad i have never 
 seen you before what is it you are talking about 
 
 of the glorious days that are gone said the rat of the 
 happy time of our and then it 
 was a great thing to get down here that was a nest quite 
 different from paris mother plague used to live here then she killed 
 people but never rats robbers and smugglers could breathe freely 
 here here was the of the most interesting personages 
 whom one now only gets to see in the theatres where they act 
 melodrama up above the time of romance is gone even in our 
 nest and here also fresh air and petroleum have broken in 
 
 thus squeaked the rat he squeaked in honor of the old time 
 when mother plague was still alive 
 
 a carriage stopped a kind of open omnibus drawn by swift horses 
 the company mounted and drove away along the boulevard de 
 sebastopol that is to say the underground boulevard over which 
 the crowded street of that name extended 
 
 the carriage disappeared in the twilight the dryad disappeared 
 lifted to the cheerful freshness above here and not below in the 
 vaulted passages filled with heavy air the wonder work must be found which she was to seek in her short lifetime it must gleam brighter than all the stronger than the moon that was just 
 gliding past 
 
 yes certainly she saw it yonder in the distance it gleamed 
 before her and twinkled and glittered like the evening star in the 
 sky 
 
 she saw a glittering portal open that led to a little garden 
 where all was brightness and dance music colored lamps surrounded 
 little lakes in which were of colored metal from 
 whose flowers jets of water spurted up beautiful weeping willows 
 real products of spring hung their fresh branches over these lakes 
 like a fresh green transparent and yet screening veil in the 
 bushes burnt an open fire throwing a red twilight over the quiet huts 
 of branches into which the sounds of music penetrated an ear 
 tickling intoxicating music that sent the blood coursing through the 
 veins 
 
 beautiful girls in festive attire with pleasant smiles on their 
 lips and the light spirit of youth in their hearts marys with 
 roses in their hair but without carriage and postilion flitted to 
 and fro in the wild dance 
 
 where were the heads where the feet as if stung by tarantulas 
 they sprang laughed rejoiced as if in their ecstacies they were 
 going to embrace all the world 
 
 the dryad felt herself torn with them into the whirl of the dance 
 round her delicate foot clung the silken boot chestnut brown in 
 color like the ribbon that floated from her hair down upon her bare 
 shoulders the green silk dress waved in large folds but did not 
 entirely hide the pretty foot and ankle 
 
 had she come to the enchanted garden of armida what was the 
 name of the place 
 
 the name glittered in over the entrance it was 
 mabille 
 
 the soaring upwards of rockets the splashing of fountains and 
 the popping of champagne corks accompanied the wild bacchantic 
 dance over the whole glided the moon through the air clear but with 
 a somewhat crooked face 
 
 a wild joviality seemed to rush through the dryad as though she 
 were intoxicated with opium her eyes spoke her lips spoke but the 
 sound of violins and of flutes drowned the sound of her voice her 
 partner whispered words to her which she did not understand nor do we understand them he stretched out his arms to draw her to him but he embraced only the empty air 
 
 the dryad had been carried away like a on the wind 
 before her she saw a flame in the air a flashing light high up on a 
 tower the beacon light shone from the goal of her longing shone from the red lighthouse tower of the fata morgana of the champ de mars 
 
 thither she was carried by the wind she circled round the tower 
 the workmen thought it was a butterfly that had come too early and 
 that now sank down dying 
 
 the moon shone bright spread light around through 
 the halls over the buildings scattered about over the 
 and the rocks produced by human ingenuity from which 
 waterfalls driven by the power of master bloodless fell down 
 the caverns of the sea the depths of the lakes the kingdom of the 
 fishes were opened here men walked as in the depths of the deep pond and held converse with the sea in the of glass the water pressed against the strong glass walls above and on every side 
 the polypi living creatures had fastened themselves to the 
 bottom and stretched out arms fathoms long for prey a big turbot 
 was making himself broad in front quietly enough but not without 
 casting some suspicious glances aside a crab clambered over him 
 looking like a gigantic spider while the shrimps wandered about in 
 restless haste like the butterflies and moths of the sea 
 
 in the fresh water grew nymphaea and reeds the 
 stood up below in rank and file all turning their heads 
 one way that the streaming water might flow into their mouths fat 
 carps stared at the glass wall with stupid eyes they knew that they 
 were here to be exhibited and that they had made the somewhat 
 toilsome journey hither in tubs filled with water and they thought 
 with dismay of the from which they had suffered so 
 cruelly on the railway 
 
 they had come to see the exhibition and now contemplated it 
 from their fresh or position they looked attentively at 
 the crowds of people who passed by them early and late all the 
 nations in the world they thought had made an exhibition of their 
 inhabitants for the edification of the soles and haddocks pike and 
 carp that they might give their opinions upon the different kinds 
 those are scaly animals said a little slimy whiting they put 
 on different scales two or three times a day and they emit sounds 
 which they call speaking we put on scales and we make 
 ourselves understood in an easier way simply by twitching the corners of our mouths and staring with our eyes we have a great many advantages over mankind 
 
 but they have learned swimming of us remarked a 
 codling you must know i come from the great sea outside in the 
 hot time of the year the people yonder go into the water first they 
 take off their scales and then they swim they have learnt from the 
 frogs to kick out with their hind legs and row with their fore 
 paws but they cannot hold out long they want to be like us but they cannot come up to us poor people 
 
 and the fishes stared they thought that the whole swarm of people 
 whom they had seen in the bright daylight were still moving around 
 them they were certain they still saw the same forms that had first 
 caught their attention 
 
 a pretty barbel with spotted skin and an enviably round back 
 declared that the human fry were still there 
 
 i can see a well human figure quite well said the 
 barbel she was called contumacious lady or something of that 
 kind she had a mouth and staring eyes like ours and a great balloon 
 at the back of her head and something like a umbrella in 
 front there were a lot of dangling bits of seaweed hanging about her 
 she ought to take all the rubbish off and go as we do then she would look something like a respectable barbel so far as it is possible for a person to look like one 
 
 become of that one whom they drew away with the hook he sat on a and had paper and pen and ink and wrote 
 down everything they called him a writer 
 
 going about with him still said a hoary old maid of a 
 carp who carried her misfortune about with her so that she was quite hoarse in her youth she had once swallowed a hook and still swam patiently about with it in her gullet a writer that means as we fishes describe it a kind of cuttle or among men 
 thus the fishes gossipped in their own way but in the artificial the laborers were busy who were obliged to take advantage of the hours of night to get their work done by daybreak they accompanied with blows of their hammers and with songs the parting words of the vanishing dryad 
 
 so at any rate i have seen you you pretty she 
 said yes i know you and she waved her hand to them i have known about you a long time in my home the swallow told me about you how beautiful you are how delicate and shining i should like to kiss every one of you you others also i know you all but you do not know me 
 
 the fishes stared out into the twilight they did not understand a 
 word of it 
 
 the dryad was there no longer she had been a long time in the 
 open air where the different countries the country of black bread 
 the codfish coast the kingdom of russia leather and the banks of 
 and the gardens of rose oil exhaled their perfumes 
 from the flower 
 
 when after a night at a ball we drive home half asleep and 
 half awake the melodies still sound plainly in our ears we hear 
 them and could sing them all from memory when the eye of the 
 murdered man closes the picture of what it saw last clings to it 
 for a time like a photographic picture 
 
 so it was likewise here the bustling life of day had not yet 
 disappeared in the quiet night the dryad had seen it she knew 
 thus it will be repeated tomorrow 
 
 the dryad stood among the fragrant roses and thought she knew 
 them and had seen them in her own home she also saw red 
 pomegranate flowers like those that little mary had worn in her 
 dark hair 
 
 remembrances from the home of her childhood flashed through her 
 thoughts her eyes eagerly drank in the prospect around and 
 feverish restlessness chased her through the halls 
 a weariness that increased continually took possession of her 
 she felt a longing to rest on the soft oriental carpets within or 
 to lean against the weeping willow without by the clear water but for 
 the ephemeral fly there was no rest in a few moments the day had 
 completed its circle 
 
 her thoughts trembled her limbs trembled she sank down on the 
 grass by the bubbling water 
 
 thou wilt ever spring living from the earth she said 
 mournfully moisten my tongue bring me a refreshing draught 
 
 i am no living water was the answer i only spring upward when 
 the machine wills it 
 
 give me something of thy freshness thou green grass implored 
 the dryad give me one of thy fragrant flowers 
 
 we must die if we are torn from our stalks replied the 
 flowers and the grass 
 
 give me a kiss thou fresh stream of air only a single 
 
 
 soon the sun will kiss the clouds red answered the wind 
 
 then thou wilt be among the dead blown away as all the splendor 
 here will be blown away before the year shall have ended then i can 
 play again with the light loose sand on the place here and whirl 
 the dust over the land and through the air all is dust 
 
 the dryad felt a terror like a woman who has cut asunder her 
 in the bath but is filled again with the love of life 
 even while she is bleeding to death she raised herself tottered 
 forward a few steps and sank down again at the entrance to a little 
 church the gate stood open lights were burning upon the altar and 
 the organ sounded 
 
 what music such notes the dryad had never yet heard and yet it 
 seemed to her as if she recognized a number of voices among them they came deep from the heart of all creation she thought she heard the stories of the old clergyman of great deeds and of the celebrated names and of the gifts that the creatures of god must bestow upon posterity if they would live on in the world 
 the tones of the organ swelled and in their song there sounded 
 these words 
 
 thy wishing and thy longing have torn thee with thy roots 
 from the place which god appointed for thee that was thy destruction thou poor dryad 
 
 the notes became soft and gentle and seemed to die away in a 
 wail 
 
 in the sky the clouds showed themselves with a ruddy gleam the 
 wind sighed pass away ye dead now the sun is going to rise 
 
 the first ray fell on the dryad her form was irradiated in 
 changing colors like the when it is bursting and 
 becomes a drop of water like a tear that falls and passes away like a 
 vapor 
 
 poor dryad only a only a tear poured upon the earth 
 and vanished away

 of negotiating 
 it is generally better to deal by speech than by letter and by the mediation of 
 a third than by a self letters are good when a man would draw an answer by letter back again or when it may seem for a justification afterwards to 
 produce his own letter or where it may be danger to be interrupted or heard by pieces 
 
 to deal in person is good when a face breedelh regard as commonly with 
 inferiors or in tender cases where a eye upon the countenance of him with 
 whom he speaketh may give him a direction how far to go and generally where a 
 man will reserve to himself liberty either to disavow or to expound in choice of 
 instruments it is better to choose men of a plainer sort that are like to do that 
 that is committed to them and to report back again faithfully the success than those that are cunning to contrive out of other business somewhat to grace themselves and will help the matter in report for satisfaction sake 
 use also such persons as affect the business wherein they are employed for that quickeneth much and such as are fit for the matter as bold men for expostulation fair spoken men for persuasion crafty men for enquiry and observation froward and absurd men for business that doth not well bear out itself use also such as have been lucky and prevailed before in things wherein you have employed them for that breeds confidence and they will strive to maintain their prescription 
 it is better to sound a person with whom one deals a far off than to fall upon the point at first except you mean to surprise him by some short question it is better dealing with men in appetite than with those that are where they would be if a man deal with another upon conditions the start or first performance is all which a man cannot reasonably demand except either the nature of the thing be such which must go before or else a man can persuade the other party that he shall still need him in some other thing or else that he be counted the honester man 
 all practice is to discover or to work men discover themselves in trust in passion at unawares and of necessity when they would have somewhat done and 
 cannot find an apt pretext if you would work any man you must either know his nature and fashions and so lead him or his ends and so persuade him or his weakness and disadvantages and so awe him or those that have interest in him and so govern him 
 in dealing with cunning persons we must ever consider their ends to interpret 
 their speeches and it is good to say little to them and that which they least look 
 for in all negotiations of difficulty a man may not look to sow and reap at once 
 but must prepare business and so ripen it by degrees

 fauchelevent becomes a gardener in paris 
 fauchelevent had dislocated his kneepan in his fall 
 father madeleine had him conveyed to an infirmary which he had established for his workmen in the factory building itself and which was served by two sisters of charity 
 on the following morning the old man found a on his with these words in father writing 
 i purchase your horse and cart the cart was broken and the horse was dead 
 fauchelevent recovered but his knee remained stiff 
 m madeleine on the recommendation of the sisters of charity and of his priest got the good man a place as gardener in a female convent in the rue in paris 
 some time afterwards m madeleine was appointed mayor 
 the first time that javert beheld m madeleine clothed in the scarf which gave him authority over the town he felt the sort of shudder which a might experience on smelling a wolf in his clothes from that time forth he avoided him as much as he possibly could when the requirements of the service imperatively demanded it and he could not do otherwise than meet the mayor he addressed him with profound respect 
 this prosperity created at m sur m by father madeleine had besides the visible signs which we have mentioned another symptom which was none the less significant for not being visible this never deceives 
 when the population suffers when work is lacking when there is no commerce the resists imposts through penury he exhausts and oversteps his respite and the state expends a great deal of money in the charges for compelling and collection 
 when work is abundant when the country is rich and happy the taxes are paid easily and cost the state nothing it may be said that there is one infallible thermometer of the public misery and cost of collecting the taxes in the course of seven years the expense of collecting the taxes had diminished in the arrondissement of m sur m and this led to this arrondissement being frequently cited from all the rest by m de villele then minister of finance 
 such was the condition of the country when fantine returned thither no one remembered her 
 fortunately the door of m factory was like the face of a friend 
 she presented herself there and was admitted to the workroom 
 the trade was entirely new to fantine she could not be very skilful at it and she therefore earned but little by her work but it was sufficient the problem was solved she was earning her living

 book two 
 chapter xix 
 
 the attack of the sixth chasseurs secured the retreat of our right flank in the center forgotten battery which had managed to set fire to the schon grabern village delayed the french advance the french were putting out the fire which the wind was spreading and thus gave us time to retreat the retirement of the center to the other side of the dip in the ground at the rear was hurried and noisy but the different companies did not get mixed but our left which consisted of the azov and podolsk infantry and the pavlograd hussars was simultaneously attacked and outflanked by superior french forces under lannes and was thrown into confusion bagration had sent zherkov to the general commanding that left flank with orders to retreat immediately 
 zherkov not removing his hand from his cap turned his horse about and galloped off but no sooner had he left bagration than his courage failed him he was seized by panic and could not go where it was dangerous 
 having reached the left flank instead of going to the front where the firing was he began to look for the general and his staff where they could not possibly be and so did not deliver the order 
 the command of the left flank belonged by seniority to the commander of the regiment kutuzov had reviewed at braunau and in which dolokhov was serving as a private but the command of the extreme left flank had been assigned to the commander of the pavlograd regiment in which rostov was serving and a misunderstanding arose the two commanders were much exasperated with one another and long after the action had begun on the right flank and the french were already advancing were engaged in discussion with the sole object of offending one another but the regiments both cavalry and infantry were by no means ready for the impending action from privates to general they were not expecting a battle and were engaged in peaceful occupations the cavalry feeding the horses and the infantry collecting wood 
 he higher iss dan i in rank said the german colonel of the hussars flushing and addressing an adjutant who had ridden up so let him do what he vill but i cannot sacrifice my hussars bugler sount ze retreat 
 but haste was becoming imperative cannon and musketry mingling together thundered on the right and in the center while the capotes of lannes sharpshooters were already seen crossing the milldam and forming up within twice the range of a musket shot the general in command of the infantry went toward his horse with jerky steps and having mounted drew himself up very straight and tall and rode to the pavlograd commander the commanders met with polite bows but with secret malevolence in their hearts 
 once again colonel said the general i leave half my men in the wood i beg of you i beg of you he repeated to occupy the position and prepare for an attack 
 i peg of you yourself not to mix in vot is not your business suddenly replied the irate colonel if you vere in the cavalry 
 i am not in the cavalry colonel but i am a russian general and if you are not aware of the fact 
 quite avare your excellency suddenly shouted the colonel touching his horse and turning purple in the face vill you be so goot to come to ze front and see dat zis position iss no goot i vish to destroy my men for your pleasure 
 you forget yourself colonel i am not considering my own pleasure and i allow it to be said 
 taking the outburst as a challenge to his courage the general expanded his chest and rode frowning beside him to the front line as if their differences would be settled there amongst the bullets they reached the front several bullets sped over them and they halted in silence there was nothing fresh to be seen from the line for from where they had been before it had been evident that it was impossible for cavalry to act among the bushes and broken ground as well as that the french were outflanking our left the general and colonel looked sternly and significantly at one another like two fighting cocks preparing for battle each vainly trying to detect signs of cowardice in the other both passed the examination successfully as there was nothing to said and neither wished to give occasion for it to be alleged that he had been the first to leave the range of fire they would have remained there for a long time testing each courage had it not been that just then they heard the rattle of musketry and a muffled shout almost behind them in the wood the french had attacked the men collecting wood in the copse it was no longer possible for the hussars to retreat with the infantry they were cut off from the line of retreat on the left by the french however inconvenient the position it was now necessary to attack in order to cut away through for themselves 
 the squadron in which rostov was serving had scarcely time to mount before it was halted facing the enemy again as at the enns bridge there was nothing between the squadron and the enemy and again that terrible dividing line of uncertainty and fear resembling the line separating the living from the dead lay between them all were conscious of this unseen line and the question whether they would they would cross it or not and how they would cross it agitated them all 
 the colonel rode to the front angrily gave some reply to questions put to him by the officers and like a man desperately insisting on having his own way gave an order no one said anything definite but the rumor of an attack spread through the squadron the command to form up rang out and the sabers whizzed as they were drawn from their scabbards still no one moved the troops of the left flank infantry and hussars alike felt that the commander did not himself know what to do and this irresolution communicated itself to the men 
 if only they would be quick thought rostov feeling that at last the time had come to experience the joy of an attack of which he had so often heard from his fellow hussars 
 with god lads rang out voice at a twot 
 the horses croups began to sway in the front line rook pulled at the reins and started of his own accord 
 before him on the right rostov saw the front lines of his hussars and still farther ahead a dark line which he could not see distinctly but took to be the enemy shots could be heard but some way off 
 faster came the word of command and rostov felt flanks drooping as he broke into a gallop 
 rostov anticipated his movements and became more and more elated he had noticed a solitary tree ahead of him this tree had been in the middle of the line that had seemed so terrible and now he had crossed that line and not only was there nothing terrible but everything was becoming more and more happy and animated oh how i will slash at him thought rostov gripping the hilt of his saber 
 came a roar of voices let anyone come my way now thought rostov driving his spurs into rook and letting him go at a full gallop so that he outstripped the others ahead the enemy was already visible suddenly something like a birch broom seemed to sweep over the squadron rostov raised his saber ready to strike but at that instant the trooper nikitenko who was galloping ahead shot away from him and rostov felt as in a dream that he continued to be carried forward with unnatural speed but yet stayed on the same spot from behind him bondarchuk an hussar he knew jolted against him and looked angrily at him horse swerved and galloped past 
 how is it i am not moving i have fallen i am killed rostov asked and answered at the same instant he was alone in the middle of a field instead of the moving horses and hussars backs he saw nothing before him but the motionless earth and the stubble around him there was warm blood under his arm no i am wounded and the horse is killed rook tried to rise on his forelegs but fell back pinning his leg blood was flowing from his head he struggled but could not rise rostov also tried to rise but fell back his sabretache having become entangled in the saddle where our men were and where the french he did not know there was no one near 
 having disentangled his leg he rose where on which side was now the line that had so sharply divided the two armies he asked himself and could not answer can something bad have happened to me he wondered as he got up and at that moment he felt that something superfluous was hanging on his benumbed left arm the wrist felt as if it were not his he examined his hand carefully vainly trying to find blood on it ah here are people coming he thought joyfully seeing some men running toward him they will help me in front came a man wearing a strange shako and a blue cloak swarthy sunburned and with a hooked nose then came two more and many more running behind one of them said something strange not in russian in among the hindmost of these men wearing similar shakos was a russian hussar he was being held by the arms and his horse was being led behind him 
 it must be one of ours a prisoner yes can it be that they will take me too who are these men thought rostov scarcely believing his eyes can they be french he looked at the approaching frenchmen and though but a moment before he had been galloping to get at them and hack them to pieces their proximity now seemed so awful that he could not believe his eyes who are they why are they running can they be coming at me and why to kill me me whom everyone is so fond of he remembered his love for him and his and his friends and the intention to kill him seemed impossible but perhaps they may do it for more than ten seconds he stood not moving from the spot or realizing the situation the foremost frenchman the one with the hooked nose was already so close that the expression of his face could be seen and the excited alien face of that man his bayonet hanging down holding his breath and running so lightly frightened rostov he seized his pistol and instead of firing it flung it at the frenchman and ran with all his might toward the bushes he did not now run with the feeling of doubt and conflict with which he had trodden the enns bridge but with the feeling of a hare fleeing from the hounds one single sentiment that of fear for his young and happy life possessed his whole being rapidly leaping the furrows he fled across the field with the impetuosity he used to show at catchplay now and then turning his pale young face to look back a shudder of terror went through him no better not look he thought but having reached the bushes he glanced round once more the french had fallen behind and just as he looked round the first man changed his run to a walk and turning shouted something loudly to a comrade farther back rostov paused no some mistake thought he they have wanted to kill me but at the same time his left arm felt as heavy as if a weight were tied to it he could run no more the frenchman also stopped and took aim rostov closed his eyes and stooped down one bullet and then another whistled past him he mustered his last remaining strength took hold of his left hand with his right and reached the bushes behind these were some russian sharpshooters

 chapter 
 
 for a year jo and her professor worked and waited hoped and loved met occasionally and wrote such voluminous letters that the rise in the price of paper was accounted for laurie said the second year began rather soberly for their prospects did not brighten and aunt march died suddenly but when their first sorrow was they loved the old lady in spite of her sharp found they had cause for rejoicing for she had left plumfield to jo which made all sorts of joyful things possible 
 a fine old place and will bring a handsome sum for of course you intend to sell it said laurie as they were all talking the matter over some weeks later 
 no i was decided answer as she petted the fat poodle whom she had adopted out of respect to his former mistress 
 you mean to live there 
 yes i do 
 but my dear girl an immense house and will take a power of money to keep it in order the garden and orchard alone need two or three men and farming in line i take it 
 try his hand at it there if i propose it 
 and you expect to live on the produce of the place well that sounds paradisiacal but find it desperate hard work 
 the crop we are going to raise is a profitable one and jo laughed 
 of what is this fine crop to consist 
 boys i want to open a school for little good happy homelike school with me to take care of them and fritz to teach them 
 a truly joian plan for you that just like her cried laurie appealing to the family who looked as much surprised as he 
 i like it said mrs march decidedly 
 so do i added her husband who welcomed the thought of a chance for trying the socratic method of education on modern youth 
 it will be an immense care for jo said meg stroking the head or her one son 
 jo can do it and be happy in it a splendid idea 
 tell us all about it cried mr laurence who had been longing to lend the lovers a hand but knew that they would refuse his help 
 i knew stand by me sir amy does see it in her eyes though she prudently waits to turn it over in her mind before she speaks now my dear people continued jo earnestly just understand that this a new idea of mine but a long cherished plan before my fritz came i used to think how when made my fortune and no one needed me at home hire a big house and pick up some poor forlorn little lads who any mothers and take care of them and make life jolly for them before it was too late i see so many going to ruin for want of help at the right minute i love so to do anything for them i seem to feel their wants and sympathize with their troubles an oh i should so like to be a mother to them 
 
 mrs march held out her hand to jo who took it smiling with tears in her eyes and went on in the old enthusiastic way which they had not seen for a long while 
 
 i told my plan to fritz once and he said it was just what he would like and agreed to try it when we got rich bless his dear heart been doing it all his poor boys i mean not getting rich that never be money stay in his pocket long enough to lay up any but now thanks to my good old aunt who loved me better than i ever deserved rich at least i feel so and we can live at plumfield perfectly well if we have a flourishing school just the place for boys the house is big and the furniture strong and plain plenty of room for dozens inside and splendid grounds outside 
 they could help in the garden and orchard such work is healthy it sir then fritz could train and teach in his own way and father will help him i can feed and nurse and pet and scold them and mother will be my always longed for lots of boys and never had enough now i can fill the house full and revel in the little dears to my content think what luxury 
 plumfield my own and a wilderness of boys to enjoy it with me 
 as jo waved her hands and gave a sigh of rapture the family went off into a gale of merriment and mr laurence laughed till they thought have an apoplectic fit 
 
 i see anything funny she said gravely when she could be heard nothing could be more natural and proper than for my professor to open a school and for me to prefer to reside in my own estate 
 
 she is putting on airs already said laurie who regarded the idea in the light of a capital joke but may i inquire how you intend to support the establishment if all the pupils are little ragamuffins afraid your crop be profitable in a worldly sense mr bhaer 
 
 now be a teddy of course i shall have rich pupils begin with such altogether then when got a start i can take in a ragamuffin or two just for a relish rich children often need care and comfort as well as poor seen unfortunate little creatures left to servants or backward ones pushed forward when real cruelty 
 some are naughty through mismanagment or neglect and some lose their mothers besides the best have to get through the hobbledehoy age and the very time they need most patience and kindness people laugh at them and hustle them about try to keep them out of sight and expect them to turn all at once from pretty children into fine young men they complain much 
 plucky little they feel it been through some thing of it and i know all about it a special interest in such young bears and like to show them that i see the warm honest boys hearts in spite of the clumsy arms and legs and the heads had experience too for i brought up one boy to be a pride and honor to his family 
 
 testify that you tried to do it said laurie with a grateful look 
 
 and succeeded beyond my hopes for here you are a steady sensible businessman doing heaps of good with your 
 money and laying up the blessings of the poor instead of dollars 
 but you are not merely a businessman you love good and beautiful things enjoy them yourself and let others go halves as you always did in the old times i am proud of you teddy for you get better every year and everyone feels it though you let them say so yes and when i have my flock just point to you and say your model my lads 
 
 poor laurie know where to look for man though he was something of the old bashfulness came over him as this burst of praise made all faces turn approvingly upon him 
 
 i say jo rather too much he began just in his old boyish way you have all done more for me than i can ever thank you for except by doing my best not to disapoint you you have rather cast me off lately jo but had the best of help nevertheless so if got on at all you may thank these two for it and he laid one hand gently on his head and the other on golden one for the three were never far apart 
 
 i do think that families are the most beautiful things in all the world burst out jo who was in an unusually frame of mind just then when i have one of my own i hope it will be as happy as the three i know and love the best if john and my fritz were only here it would be quite a little heaven on earth she added more quietly and that night when she went to her room after a blissful evening of family counsels hopes and plans her heart was so full of happiness that she could only calm it by kneeling beside the empty bed always near her own and thinking tender thoughts of beth 
 it was a very astonishing year altogether for things seemed to happen in an unusually rapid and delightful manner almost before she knew where she was jo found herself married and settled at plumfield then a family of six or seven boys sprung up like mushrooms and flourished surprisingly poor boys as well as rich for mr laurence was continually finding some touching case of destitution and begging the bhaers to take pity on the child and he would gladly pay a trifle for its support in this way the sly old gentleman got round proud jo and furnished her with the style of boy in which she most delighted 
 
 of course it was uphill work at first and jo made queer mistakes but the wise professor steered her safely into calmer waters and the most rampant ragamuffin was conquered in the end how jo did enjoy her wilderness of boys and how poor dear aunt march would have lamented had she been there to see the sacred precincts of prim plumfield overrun with toms dicks and harrys there was a sort of poetic justice about it after all for the old lady had been the terror of the boys for miles around and now the exiles feasted freely on forbidden plums kicked up the gravel with profane boots unreproved and played cricket in the big field where the irritable cow with a crumpled horn used to invite rash youths to come and be tossed it became a sort of boys paradise and laurie suggested that it should be called the as a compliment to its master and appropriate to its inhabitants 
 
 it never was a fashionable school and the professor did not lay up a fortune but it was just what jo intended it to be a happy homelike place for boys who needed teaching care and kindness every room in the big house was soon full every little plot in the garden soon had its owner a regular menagerie appeared in barn and shed for pet animals were allowed and three times a day jo smiled at her fritz from the head of a long table lined on either side with rows of happy young faces which all turned to her with affectionate eyes confiding words and grateful hearts full of love for mother bhaer she had boys enough now and did not tire of them though they were not angels by any means and some of them caused both professor and professorin much trouble and anxiety but her faith in the good spot which exists in the heart of the naughtiest sauciest most tantalizing little ragamuffin gave her patience skill and in time success for no mortal boy could hold out long with father bhaer shining on him as benevolently as the sun and mother bhaer forgiving him seventy times seven very precious to jo was the friendship of the lads their penitent sniffs and whispers after wrongdoing their droll or touching little confidences their pleasant enthusiasms hopes and plans even their misfortunes for they only endeared them to her all the more there were slow boys and bashful boys feeble boys and riotous boys boys that lisped and boys that stuttered one or two lame ones and a merry little quadroon who could not be taken in elsewhere but who was welcome to the though some people predicted that his admission would ruin the school 
 
 yes jo was a very happy woman there in spite of hard work much anxiety and a perpetual racket she enjoyed it heartily and found the applause of her boys more satisfying than any praise of the world for now she told no stories except to her flock of enthusiastic believers and admirers as the years went on two little lads of her own came to increase her named for grandpa and teddy a baby who seemed to have inherited his sunshiny temper as well as his lively spirit how they ever grew up alive in that whirlpool of boys was a mystery to their grandma and aunts but they flourished like dandelions in spring and their rough nurses loved and served them well 
 
 there were a great many holidays at plumfield and one of the most delightful was the yearly for then the marches laurences brookes and bhaers turned out in full force and made a day of it five years after wedding one of these fruitful festivals occurred a mellow october day when the air was full of an exhilarating freshness which made the spirits rise and the blood dance healthily in the veins the old orchard wore its holiday attire goldenrod and asters fringed the mossy walls grasshoppers skipped briskly in the sere grass and crickets chirped like fairy pipers at a feast squirrels were busy with their small harvesting birds twittered their adieux from the alders in the lane and every tree stood ready to send down its shower of red or yellow apples at the first shake everybody was there 
 everybody laughed and sang climbed up and tumbled down everybody declared that there never had been such a perfect day or such a jolly set to enjoy it and everyone gave themselves up to the simple pleasures of the hour as freely as if there were no such things as care or sorrow in the world 
 
 mr march strolled placidly about quoting tusser cowley and columella to mr laurence while enjoying 
 
 the gentle winey juice 
 
 the professor charged up and down the green aisles like a stout teutonic knight with a pole for a lance leading on the boys who made a hook and ladder company of themselves and performed wonders in the way of ground and lofty tumbling laurie devoted himself to the little ones rode his small daughter in a took daisy up among the nests and kept adventurous rob from breaking his neck mrs march and meg sat among the apple piles like a pair of pomonas sorting the contributions that kept pouring in while amy with a beautiful motherly expression in her face sketched the various groups and watched over one pale lad who sat adoring her with his little crutch beside him 
 
 jo was in her element that day and rushed about with her gown pinned up and her hat anywhere but on her head and her baby tucked under her arm ready for any lively adventure which might turn up little teddy bore a charmed life for nothing ever happened to him and jo never felt any anxiety when he was whisked up into a tree by one lad galloped off on the back of another or supplied with sour russets by his indulgent papa who labored under the germanic delusion that babies could digest anything from pickled cabbage to buttons nails and their own small shoes she knew that little ted would turn up again in time safe and rosy dirty and serene and she always received him back with a hearty welcome for jo loved her babies tenderly 
 
 at four a lull took place and baskets remained empty while the apple pickers rested and compared rents and bruises then jo and meg with a detachment of the bigger boys set forth the supper on the grass for an tea was always the crowning joy of the day the land literally flowed with milk and honey on such occasions for the lads were not required to sit at table but allowed to partake of refreshment as they being the sauce best beloved by the boyish soul they availed themselves of the rare privilege to the fullest extent for some tried the pleasing experiment of drinking mild while standing on their heads others lent a charm to leapfrog by eating pie in the pauses of the game cookies were sown broadcast over the field and apple turnovers roosted in the trees like a new style of bird the little girls had a private tea party and ted roved among the edibles at his own sweet will 
 
 when no one could eat any more the professor proposed the first regular toast which was always drunk at such march god bless her a toast heartily given by the good man who never forgot how much he owed her and quietly drunk by the boys who had been taught to keep her memory green 
 
 now sixtieth birthday long life to her with three times three 
 
 that was given with a will as you may well believe and the cheering once begun it was hard to stop it health was proposed form mr laurence who was considered their special patron to the astonished guinea pig who had strayed from its proper sphere in search of its young master demi as the oldest grandchild then presented the queen of the day with various gifts so numerous that they were transported to the festive scene in a wheelbarrow funny presents some of them but what would have been defects to other eyes were ornaments to the gifts were all their own every stitch patient little fingers had put into the handkerchiefs she hemmed was better than embroidery to mrs march miracle of mechanical skill though the cover shut footstool had a wiggle in its uneven legs that she declared was soothing and no page of the costly book child gave her was so fair as that on which appeared in tipsy capitals the words 
 to dear grandma from her little beth during the ceremony the boys had mysteriously disappeared and when mrs march had tried to thank her children and broken down while teddy wiped her eyes on his pinafore the professor suddenly began to sing then from above him voice after voice took up the words and from tree to tree echoed the music of the unseen choir as the boys sang with all their hearts the little song that jo had written laurie set to music and the professor trained his lads to give with the best effect this was something altogether new and it proved a grand success for mrs march get over her surprise and insisted on shaking hands with every one of the featherless birds from tall franz and emil to the little quadroon who had the sweetest voice of all 
 after this the boys dispersed for a final lark leaving mrs march and her daughters under the festival tree 
 i think i ever ought to call myself unlucky jo again when my greatest wish has been so beautifully gratified said mrs bhaer taking little fist out of the milk pitcher in which he was rapturously churning 
 and yet your life is very different from the one you pictured so long ago do you remember our castles in the air asked amy smiling as she watched laurie and john playing cricket with the boys 
 
 dear fellows it does my heart good to see them forget business and frolic for a day answered jo who now spoke in a maternal way of all mankind yes i remember but the life i wanted then seems selfish lonely and cold to me now i given up the hope that i may write a good book yet but i can wait and sure it will be all the better for such experiences and illustrations as these and jo pointed from the lively lads in the distance to her father leaning on the arm as they walked to and fro in the sunshine deep in one of the conversations which both enjoyed so much and then to her mother sitting enthroned among her daughters with their children in her lap and at her feet as if all found help and happiness in the face which never could grow old to them 
 my castle was the most nearly realized of all i asked for splendid things to be sure but in my heart i knew i should be satisfied if i had a little home and john and some dear children like these got them all thank god and am the happiest woman in the world and meg laid her hand on her tall head with a face full of tender and devout content 
 
 my castle is very different from what i planned but i would not alter it though like jo i relinquish all my artistic hopes or confine myself to helping others fulfill their dreams of beauty begun to model a figure of baby and laurie says it is the best thing ever done i think so myself and mean to do it in marble so that whatever happens i may at least keep the image of my little angel 
 
 as amy spoke a great tear dropped on the golden hair of the sleeping child in her arms for her one daughter was a frail little creature and the dread of losing her was the shadow over sunshine this cross was doing much for both father and mother for one love and sorrow bound them closely together nature was growing sweeter deeper and more tender laurie was growing more serious strong and firm and both were learning that beauty youth good fortune even love itself cannot keep care and pain loss and sorrow from the most blessed for 
 into each life some rain must fall some days must be dark and sad and dreary 
 she is growing better i am sure of it my dear despond but hope and keep happy said mrs march as tenderhearted daisy stooped from her knee to lay her rosy cheek against her little pale one 
 i never ought to while i have you to cheer me up marmee and laurie to take more than half of every burden replied amy warmly he never lets me see his anxiety but is so sweet and patient with me so devoted to beth and such a stay and comfort to me always that i love him enough so in spite of my one cross i can say with meg thank god a happy woman 
 no need for me to say it for everyone can see that far happier than i deserve added jo glancing from her good husband to her chubby children tumbling on the grass beside her fritz is getting gray and stout growing as thin as a shadow and am thirty we never shall be rich and plumfield may burn up any night for that incorrigible tommy bangs will smoke cigars under the though set himself afire three times already but in spite of these unromantic facts i have nothing to complain of and never was so jolly in my life excuse the remark but living among boys i help using their expressions now and then 
 yes jo i think your harvest will be a good one beganmrs march frightening away a big black cricket that was staring teddy out of countenance 
 not half so good as yours mother here it is and we never can thank you enough for the patient sowing and reaping you have done cried jo with the loving impetuosity which she never would outgrow 
 i hope there will be more wheat and fewer tares every year said amy softly 
 a large sheaf but i know room in your heart for it marmee dear added tender voice 
 touched to the heart mrs march could only stretch out her arms as if to gather children and grandchildren to herself and say with face and voice full of motherly love gratitude and humility 
 oh my girls however long you may live i never can wish you a greater happiness than this

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the dumb book 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 in the which led through a wood stood a solitary 
 the road in fact ran right through its yard the sun was 
 shining and all the windows were open within the house people were 
 very busy in the yard in an arbour formed by lilac bushes in full 
 bloom stood an open coffin thither they had carried a dead man 
 who was to be buried that very afternoon nobody shed a tear over him his face was covered over with a white cloth under his head they 
 had placed a large thick book the leaves of which consisted of folded sheets of and withered flowers lay between them it was the herbarium which he had gathered in various places and was to be buried with him according to his own wish every one of the flowers in it was connected with some chapter of his life 
 
 who is the dead man we asked 
 
 the old student was the reply they say that he was once an 
 energetic young man that he studied the dead languages and sang 
 and even composed many songs then something had happened to him and in consequence of this he gave himself up to drink body and mind 
 
 when at last he had ruined his health they brought him into the 
 country where someone paid for his board and residence he was gentle as a child as long as the sullen mood did not come over him but when it came he was fierce became as strong as a giant and ran about in the wood like a chased deer but when we succeeded in bringing him home and prevailed upon him to open the book with the plants in it he would sometimes sit for a whole day looking at this or that plant while frequently the tears rolled over his cheeks 
 god knows what was in his mind but he requested us to put the book into his coffin and now he lies there in a little while the lid will 
 be placed upon the coffin and he will have sweet rest in the grave 
 
 the cloth which covered his face was lifted up the dead 
 face expressed peace a sunbeam fell upon it a swallow flew with 
 the swiftness of an arrow into the arbour turning in its flight 
 and twittered over the dead head 
 
 what a strange feeling it is surely we all know it to look 
 through old letters of our young days a different life rises up out 
 of the past as it were with all its hopes and sorrows how many of 
 the people with whom in those days we used to be on intimate terms 
 appear to us as if dead and yet they are still alive only we have 
 not thought of them for such a long time whom we imagined we should retain in our memories for ever and share every joy and sorrow with them 
 
 the withered oak leaf in the book here recalled the friend the 
 schoolfellow who was to be his friend for life he fixed the leaf 
 to the cap in the green wood when they vowed eternal 
 friendship where does he dwell now the leaf is kept but the 
 friendship does no longer exist here is a foreign hothouse plant too 
 tender for the gardens of the north it is almost as if its leaves 
 still smelt sweet she gave it to him out of her own garden a 
 daughter 
 
 here is a that he had plucked himself and watered with 
 salt tears a lily of sweet water and here is a nettle what may 
 its leaves tell us what might he have thought when he plucked and 
 kept it here is a little snowdrop out of the solitary wood here is 
 an evergreen from the at the tavern and here is a simple 
 blade of grass 
 
 the lilac bends its fresh fragrant flowers over the dead 
 head the swallow passes again twit twit now the men come with 
 hammer and nails the lid is placed over the dead man while his 
 head rests on the dumb book so long cherished now closed for ever

 of followers friends 
 costly followers are not to be liked lest while a man maketh his train longer he 
 make his wings shorter i reckon to be costly not them alone which charge the purse but which are wearisome and importune in suits ordinary followers ought to challenge no higher conditions than countenance recommendation and protection from wrongs 
 factious followers are worse to be liked which follow not upon affection to him 
 with whom they range themselves but upon discontentment conceived against some other whereupon commonly ensueth that ill intelligence that we many times see between great personages likewise glorious followers who make themselves as trumpets of the commendation of those they follow are full of inconvenience for they taint business through want of secrecy and they export honour from a man and make him a return in envy 
 there is a kind of followers likewise which are dangerous being indeed 
 espials which enquire the secrets of the house and bear tales of them to others 
 
 yet such men many times are in great favour for they are officious and commonly exchange tales the following by certain estates of men answerable to that which a great person himself professeth as of soldiers to him that hath been employed in me wars and the like hath ever been a thing civil and well taken even in monarchies so it be without too much pomp or popularity but the most honourable kind of following is to be followed as one that apprehendeth to advance virtue and desert in all sorts of persons 
 and yet where there is no eminent odds in sufficiency it is better to take with me more passable than with the more able and besides to speak truth in base times active men are of more use than virtuous it is true that in government it is good to use men of one rank equally for to countenance some extraordinarily is to make them insolent and the rest discontent because they may claim a due 
 but contrariwise in favour to use men with much difference and election is good for it makelh the persons preferred more thankful and the rest more officious because all is of favour it is good discretion not to make too much of any man at the first because one cannot hold out that proportion 
 to be governed as we call it by one is not safe for it shows softness and gives a freedom to scandal and disreputation for those that would not censure or speak ill of a man immediately will talk more boldly of those that are so great with them and thereby wound their honour yet to be distracted with many is worse for it makes men to be of the last impression and full of change to take advice of some few friends is ever honourable for many times see more than gamesters and the vale best discovered the hill there is little friendship in the world and least of all between equals which was wont to be magnified that that is is between superior and inferior whose fortunes may comprehend the one the other

 book descent 
 chapter viii 
 
 madame victurnien expends thirty francs on morality 
 when fantine saw that she was making her living she felt joyful for a moment 
 to live honestly by her own labor what mercy from heaven 
 the taste for work had really returned to her she bought a took pleasure in surveying in it her youth her beautiful hair her fine teeth she forgot many things she thought only of cosette and of the possible future and was almost happy she hired a little room and furnished on credit on the strength of her future lingering trace of her improvident ways as she was not able to say that she was married she took good care as we have seen not to mention her little girl 
 at first as the reader has seen she paid the thenardiers promptly as she only knew how to sign her name she was obliged to write through a public 
 she wrote often and this was noticed 
 it began to be said in an undertone in the workroom that fantine wrote letters and that she had ways about her 
 there is no one for spying on actions like those who are not concerned in them 
 why does that gentleman never come except at nightfall 
 why does mr never hang his key on its nail on tuesday 
 why does he always take the narrow streets why does madame always descend from her before reaching her house 
 why does she send out to purchase six sheets of note paper when she has a whole shop full of it etc 
 there exist beings who for the sake of obtaining the key to these enigmas which are moreover of no consequence whatever to them spend more money waste more time take more trouble than would be required for ten good actions and that gratuitously for their own pleasure without receiving any other payment for their curiosity than curiosity 
 they will follow up such and such a man or woman for whole days they will do sentry duty for hours at a time on the corners of the streets under doors at night in cold and rain they will bribe they will make the drivers of and lackeys tipsy buy a suborn a porter 
 why 
 for no reason a pure passion for seeing knowing and penetrating into things a pure itch for talking 
 and often these secrets once known these mysteries made public these enigmas illuminated by the light of day bring on catastrophies duels failures the ruin of families and broken lives to the great joy of those who have found out everything without any interest in the matter and by pure instinct 
 a sad thing 
 certain persons are malicious solely through a necessity for talking their conversation the chat of the gossip of the anteroom is like those chimneys which consume wood rapidly they need a great amount of combustibles and their combustibles are furnished by their neighbors 
 so fantine was watched 
 in addition many a one was jealous of her golden hair and of her white teeth 
 it was remarked that in the workroom she often turned aside in the midst of the rest to wipe away a tear 
 these were the moments when she was thinking of her child perhaps also of the man whom she had loved 
 breaking the gloomy bonds of the past is a mournful task 
 it was observed that she wrote twice a month at least and that she paid the carriage on the letter 
 they managed to obtain the address monsieur monsieur thenardier at montfermeil the public writer a good old man who could not fill his stomach with red wine without emptying his pocket of secrets was made to talk in the in short it was discovered that fantine had a child she must be a pretty sort of a woman 
 an old gossip was found who made the trip to montfermeil talked to the thenardiers and said on her return 
 for my five and thirty francs i have freed my mind i have seen the child 
 the gossip who did this thing was a gorgon named madame victurnien the guardian and of every virtue madame victurnien was and the mask of ugliness with the mask of age 
 a quavering voice a whimsical mind this old dame had once been fact 
 in her youth in she had married a monk who had fled from his cloister in a red cap and passed from the bernardines to the jacobins she was dry rough peevish sharp captious almost venomous all this in memory of her monk whose widow she was and who had ruled over her masterfully and bent her to his will she was a nettle in which the rustle of the cassock was visible at the restoration she had turned bigot and that with so much energy that the priests had forgiven her her monk 
 she had a small property which she bequeathed with much ostentation to a religious community she was in high favor at the episcopal palace of arras 
 so this madame victurnien went to montfermeil and returned with the remark i have seen the child 
 all this took time 
 fantine had been at the factory for more than a year when one morning the superintendent of the workroom handed her fifty francs from the mayor told her that she was no longer employed in the shop and requested her in the name to leave the neighborhood 
 this was the very month when the thenardiers after having demanded twelve francs instead of six had just exacted fifteen francs instead of twelve 
 fantine was overwhelmed 
 she could not leave the neighborhood she was in debt for her rent and furniture 
 fifty francs was not sufficient to cancel this debt 
 she stammered a few supplicating words the superintendent ordered her to leave the shop on the instant besides fantine was only a moderately good workwoman overcome with shame even more than with despair she quitted the shop and returned to her room 
 so her fault was now known to every one 
 she no longer felt strong enough to say a word 
 she was advised to see the mayor she did not dare 
 the mayor had given her fifty francs because he was good and had dismissed her because he was just she bowed before the decision

 book two 
 chapter xx 
 
 the infantry regiments that had been caught unawares in the outskirts of the wood ran out of it the different companies getting mixed and retreated as a disorderly crowd one soldier in his fear uttered the senseless cry cut off that is so terrible in battle and that word infected the whole crowd with a feeling of panic 
 surrounded cut off lost shouted the fugitives 
 the moment he heard the firing and the cry from behind the general realized that something dreadful had happened to his regiment and the thought that he an exemplary officer of many years service who had never been to blame might be held responsible at headquarters for negligence or inefficiency so staggered him that forgetting the recalcitrant cavalry colonel his own dignity as a general and above all quite forgetting the danger and all regard for he clutched the crupper of his saddle and spurring his horse galloped to the regiment under a hail of bullets which fell around but fortunately missed him his one desire was to know what was happening and at any cost correct or remedy the mistake if he had made one so that he an exemplary officer of years service who had never been censured should not be held to blame 
 having galloped safely through the french he reached a field behind the copse across which our men regardless of orders were running and descending the valley that moment of moral hesitation which decides the fate of battles had arrived would this disorderly crowd of soldiers attend to the voice of their commander or would they disregarding him continue their flight despite his desperate shouts that used to seem so terrible to the soldiers despite his furious purple countenance distorted out of all likeness to his former self and the flourishing of his saber the soldiers all continued to run talking firing into the air and disobeying orders the moral hesitation which decided the fate of battles was evidently culminating in a panic 
 the general had a fit of coughing as a result of shouting and of the powder smoke and stopped in despair everything seemed lost but at that moment the french who were attacking suddenly and without any apparent reason ran back and disappeared from the outskirts and russian sharpshooters showed themselves in the copse it was company which alone had maintained its order in the wood and having lain in ambush in a ditch now attacked the french unexpectedly timokhin armed only with a sword had rushed at the enemy with such a desperate cry and such mad drunken determination that taken by surprise the french had thrown down their muskets and run dolokhov running beside timokhin killed a frenchman at close quarters and was the first to seize the surrendering french officer by his collar our fugitives returned the battalions and the french who had nearly cut our left flank in half were for the moment repulsed our reserve units were able to join up and the fight was at an end the regimental commander and major ekonomov had stopped beside a bridge letting the retreating companies pass by them when a soldier came up and took hold of the stirrup almost leaning against him the man was wearing a bluish coat of broadcloth he had no knapsack or cap his head was bandaged and over his shoulder a french munition pouch was slung he had an sword in his hand the soldier was pale his blue eyes looked impudently into the face and his lips were smiling though the commander was occupied in giving instructions to major ekonomov he could not help taking notice of the soldier 
 your excellency here are two trophies said dolokhov pointing to the french sword and pouch i have taken an officer prisoner i stopped the company dolokhov breathed heavily from weariness and spoke in abrupt sentences the whole company can bear witness i beg you will remember this your excellency 
 all right all right replied the commander and turned to major ekonomov 
 but dolokhov did not go away he untied the handkerchief around his head pulled it off and showed the blood congealed on his hair 
 a bayonet wound i remained at the front remember your excellency 
 battery had been forgotten and only at the very end of the action did prince bagration still hearing the cannonade in the center send his orderly staff officer and later prince andrew also to order the battery to retire as quickly as possible when the supports attached to battery had been moved away in the middle of the action by order the battery had continued firing and was only not captured by the french because the enemy could not surmise that anyone could have the effrontery to continue firing from four quite undefended guns on the contrary the energetic action of that battery led the french to suppose that here in the center the main russian forces were concentrated twice they had attempted to attack this point but on each occasion had been driven back by grapeshot from the four isolated guns on the hillock 
 soon after prince bagration had left him tushin had succeeded in setting fire to schon grabern 
 look at them scurrying burning just see the smoke fine grand look at the smoke the smoke exclaimed the artillerymen brightening up 
 all the guns without waiting for orders were being fired in the direction of the conflagration as if urging each other on the soldiers cried at each shot fine good look at it grand the fire fanned by the breeze was rapidly spreading the french columns that had advanced beyond the village went back but as though in revenge for this failure the enemy placed ten guns to the right of the village and began firing them at battery 
 in their childlike glee aroused by the fire and their luck in successfully cannonading the french our artillerymen only noticed this battery when two balls and then four more fell among our guns one knocking over two horses and another tearing off a leg their spirits once roused were however not diminished but only changed character the horses were replaced by others from a reserve gun carriage the wounded were carried away and the four guns were turned against the battery companion officer had been killed at the beginning of the engagement and within an hour seventeen of the forty men of the guns crews had been disabled but the artillerymen were still as merry and lively as ever twice they noticed the french appearing below them and then they fired grapeshot at them 
 little tushin moving feebly and awkwardly kept telling his orderly to refill my pipe for that one and then scattering sparks from it ran forward shading his eyes with his small hand to look at the french 
 smack at em lads he kept saying seizing the guns by the wheels and working the screws himself 
 amid the smoke deafened by the incessant reports which always made him jump tushin not taking his pipe from his mouth ran from gun to gun now aiming now counting the charges now giving orders about replacing dead or wounded horses and harnessing fresh ones and shouting in his feeble voice so high pitched and irresolute his face grew more and more animated only when a man was killed or wounded did he frown and turn away from the sight shouting angrily at the men who as is always the case hesitated about lifting the injured or dead the soldiers for the most part handsome fellows and as is always the case in an artillery company a head and shoulders taller and twice as broad as their officer all looked at their commander like children in an embarrassing situation and the expression on his face was invariably reflected on theirs 
 owing to the terrible uproar and the necessity for concentration and activity tushin did not experience the slightest unpleasant sense of fear and the thought that he might be killed or badly wounded never occurred to him on the contrary he became more and more elated it seemed to him that it was a very long time ago almost a day since he had first seen the enemy and fired the first shot and that the corner of the field he stood on was and familiar ground though he thought of everything considered everything and did everything the best of officers could do in his position he was in a state akin to feverish delirium or drunkenness 
 from the deafening sounds of his own guns around him the whistle and thud of the cannon balls from the flushed and perspiring faces of the crew bustling round the guns from the sight of the blood of men and horses from the little puffs of smoke on the side always followed by a ball flying past and striking the earth a man a gun a horse from the sight of all these things a fantastic world of his own had taken possession of his brain and at that moment afforded him pleasure the guns were in his fancy not guns but pipes from which occasional puffs were blown by an invisible smoker 
 there puffing again muttered tushin to himself as a small cloud rose from the hill and was borne in a streak to the left by the wind 
 now look out for the ball throw it back 
 what do you want your honor asked an artilleryman standing close by who heard him muttering 
 nothing only a shell he answered 
 come along our matvevna he said to himself matvevna was the name his fancy gave to the farthest gun of the battery which was large and of an old pattern the french swarming round their guns seemed to him like ants in that world the handsome drunkard number one of the second crew was uncle tushin looked at him more often than at anyone else and took delight in his every movement the sound of musketry at the foot of the hill now diminishing now increasing seemed like breathing he listened intently to the ebb and flow of these sounds 
 daughter of matthew 
 ah breathing again breathing he muttered to himself 
 he imagined himself as an enormously tall powerful man who was throwing cannon balls at the french with both hands 
 now then matvevna dear old lady let me down he was saying as he moved from the gun when a strange unfamiliar voice called above his head captain tushin captain 
 tushin turned round in dismay it was the staff officer who had turned him out of the booth at grunth he was shouting in a gasping voice 
 are you mad you have twice been ordered to retreat and you 
 why are they down on me thought tushin looking in alarm at his superior 
 i he muttered holding up two fingers to his cap i 
 but the staff officer did not finish what he wanted to say a cannon ball flying close to him caused him to duck and bend over his horse he paused and just as he was about to say something more another ball stopped him he turned his horse and galloped off 
 retire all to retire he shouted from a distance 
 the soldiers laughed a moment later an adjutant arrived with the same order 
 it was prince andrew the first thing he saw on riding up to the space where guns were stationed was an unharnessed horse with a broken leg that lay screaming piteously beside the harnessed horses blood was gushing from its leg as from a spring among the limbers lay several dead men one ball after another passed over as he approached and he felt a nervous shudder run down his spine but the mere thought of being afraid roused him again i cannot be afraid thought he and dismounted slowly among the guns he delivered the order and did not leave the battery he decided to have the guns removed from their positions and withdrawn in his presence together with tushin stepping across the bodies and under a terrible fire from the french he attended to the removal of the guns 
 a staff officer was here a minute ago but skipped off said an artilleryman to prince andrew not like your honor 
 prince andrew said nothing to tushin they were both so busy as to seem not to notice one another when having limbered up the only two cannon that remained uninjured out of the four they began moving down the hill one shattered gun and one unicorn were left behind prince andrew rode up to tushin 
 well till we meet again he said holding out his hand to tushin 
 my dear fellow said tushin dear soul my dear fellow and for some unknown reason tears suddenly filled his eyes

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the elf of the rose 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 in the midst of a garden grew a in full blossom and in 
 the prettiest of all the roses lived an elf he was such a little 
 wee thing that no human eye could see him behind each leaf of the 
 rose he had a sleeping chamber he was as well formed and as beautiful as a little child could be and had wings that reached from his shoulders to his feet oh what sweet fragrance there was in his 
 chambers and how clean and beautiful were the walls for they were 
 the blushing leaves of the rose 
 
 during the whole day he enjoyed himself in the warm sunshine flew 
 from flower to flower and danced on the wings of the flying 
 butterflies then he took it into his head to measure how many steps 
 he would have to go through the roads and that are on 
 the leaf of a what we call the veins on a leaf he took 
 for roads ay and very long roads they were for him for before he 
 had half finished his task the sun went down he had commenced his 
 work too late it became very cold the dew fell and the wind blew 
 so he thought the best thing he could do would be to return home he 
 hurried himself as much as he could but he found the roses all closed 
 up and he could not get in not a single rose stood open the poor 
 little elf was very much frightened he had never before been out at 
 night but had always slumbered secretly behind the warm 
 oh this would certainly be his death at the other end 
 of the garden he knew there was an arbor overgrown with beautiful 
 the blossoms looked like large painted horns and he 
 thought to himself he would go and sleep in one of these till the 
 morning he flew thither but hush two people were in the arbor a 
 handsome young man and a beautiful lady they sat side by side and 
 wished that they might never be obliged to part they loved each other much more than the best child can love its father and mother 
 
 but we must part said the young man your brother does not 
 like our engagement and therefore he sends me so far away on 
 business over mountains and seas farewell my sweet bride for so 
 you are to me 
 
 and then they kissed each other and the girl wept and gave him a 
 rose but before she did so she pressed a kiss upon it so fervently 
 that the flower opened then the little elf flew in and leaned his 
 head on the delicate fragrant walls here he could plainly hear 
 them say farewell farewell and he felt that the rose had been 
 placed on the young breast oh how his heart did beat the 
 little elf could not go to sleep it thumped so loudly the young 
 man took it out as he walked through the dark wood alone and kissed the flower so often and so violently that the little elf was almost crushed he could feel through the leaf how hot the lips of the 
 young man were and the rose had opened as if from the heat of the 
 noonday sun 
 
 there came another man who looked gloomy and wicked he was the wicked brother of the beautiful maiden he drew out a sharp knife and while the other was kissing the rose the wicked man stabbed him to death then he cut off his head and buried it with the body in the 
 soft earth under the 
 
 now he is gone and will soon be forgotten thought the wicked 
 brother he will never come back again he was going on a long 
 journey over mountains and seas it is easy for a man to lose his life 
 in such a journey my sister will suppose he is dead for he cannot 
 come back and she will not dare to question me about him 
 then he scattered the dry leaves over the light earth with his 
 foot and went home through the darkness but he went not alone as he thought the little elf accompanied him he sat in a dry 
 which had fallen from the tree on to the wicked 
 head as he was digging the grave the hat was on the head now 
 which made it very dark and the little elf shuddered with fright 
 and indignation at the wicked deed 
 
 it was the dawn of morning before the wicked man reached home 
 he took off his hat and went into his room there lay the 
 beautiful blooming girl dreaming of him whom she loved so and who was now she supposed travelling far away over mountain and sea 
 
 her wicked brother stopped over her and laughed hideously as 
 fiends only can laugh the dry leaf fell out of his hair upon the 
 counterpane but he did not notice it and went to get a little 
 sleep during the early morning hours but the elf slipped out of the 
 withered leaf placed himself by the ear of the sleeping girl and 
 told her as in a dream of the horrid murder described the place 
 where her brother had slain her lover and buried his body and told 
 her of the in full blossom that stood close by 
 
 that you may not think this is only a dream that i have told 
 you he said you will find on your bed a withered leaf 
 
 then she awoke and found it there oh what bitter tears she 
 shed and she could not open her heart to any one for relief 
 
 the window stood open the whole day and the little elf could 
 easily have reached the roses or any of the flowers but he could not 
 find it in his heart to leave one so afflicted in the window stood 
 a bush bearing monthly roses he seated himself in one of the flowers and gazed on the poor girl her brother often came into the room and would be quite cheerful in spite of his base conduct so she dare not say a word to him of her grief 
 
 as soon as night came on she slipped out of the house and went 
 into the wood to the spot where the stood and after 
 removing the leaves from the earth she turned it up and there 
 found him who had been murdered oh how she wept and prayed that she also might die gladly would she have taken the body home with her but that was impossible so she took up the poor head with the closed eyes kissed the cold lips and shook the mould out of the 
 beautiful hair 
 
 i will keep this said she and as soon as she had covered the 
 body again with the earth and leaves she took the head and a little 
 sprig of jasmine that bloomed in the wood near the spot where he 
 was buried and carried them home with her as soon as she was in 
 her room she took the largest she could find and in 
 this she placed the head of the dead man covered it up with earth 
 and planted the twig of jasmine in it 
 
 farewell farewell whispered the little elf he could not any 
 longer endure to witness all this agony of grief he therefore flew 
 away to his own rose in the garden but the rose was faded only a few dry leaves still clung to the green hedge behind it 
 
 alas how soon all that is good and beautiful passes away 
 sighed the elf 
 
 after a while he found another rose which became his home for 
 among its delicate fragrant leaves he could dwell in safety every 
 morning he flew to the window of the poor girl and always found her 
 weeping by the flower pot the bitter tears fell upon the jasmine 
 twig and each day as she became paler and paler the sprig 
 appeared to grow greener and fresher one shoot after another sprouted forth and little white buds blossomed which the poor girl fondly kissed but her wicked brother scolded her and asked her if she was going mad he could not imagine why she was weeping over that and it annoyed him he did not know whose closed eyes were there nor what red lips were fading beneath the earth and one day she sat and leaned her head against the and the little elf of the rose found her asleep then he seated himself by her ear talked to her of that evening in the arbor of the sweet perfume of 
 the rose and the loves of the elves sweetly she dreamed and while 
 she dreamt her life passed away calmly and gently and her spirit was 
 with him whom she loved in heaven and the jasmine opened its large 
 white bells and spread forth its sweet fragrance it had no other way 
 of showing its grief for the dead but the wicked brother considered 
 the beautiful blooming plant as his own property left to him by his 
 sister and he placed it in his sleeping room close by his bed for 
 it was very lovely in appearance and the fragrance sweet and 
 delightful the little elf of the rose followed it and flew from 
 flower to flower telling each little spirit that dwelt in them the 
 story of the murdered young man whose head now formed part of the earth beneath them and of the wicked brother and the poor sister we know it said each little spirit in the flowers we know it for 
 have we not sprung from the eyes and lips of the murdered one we know it we know it and the flowers nodded with their heads in a peculiar manner the elf of the rose could not understand how they could rest so quietly in the matter so he flew to the bees who were gathering honey and told them of the wicked brother and the bees told it to their queen who commanded that the next morning they should go and kill the murderer but during the night the first after the 
 death while the brother was sleeping in his bed close to 
 where he had placed the fragrant jasmine every flower cup opened and invisibly the little spirits stole out armed with poisonous spears 
 
 they placed themselves by the ear of the sleeper told him dreadful 
 dreams and then flew across his lips and pricked his tongue with 
 their poisoned spears now have we revenged the dead said they and flew back into the white bells of the jasmine flowers when the 
 morning came and as soon as the window was opened the rose elf with the queen bee and the whole swarm of bees rushed in to kill him but he was already dead people were standing round the bed and saying that the scent of the jasmine had killed him then the elf of the rose understood the revenge of the flowers and explained it to the queen bee and she with the whole swarm buzzed about the the bees could not be driven away then a man took it up to remove it and one of the bees stung him in the hand so that he let the fall and it was broken to pieces then every one saw the whitened skull and they knew the dead man in the bed was a murderer and the queen bee hummed in the air and sang of the revenge of the flowers and of the elf of the rose and said that behind the smallest leaf dwells one who can discover evil deeds and punish them also

 of suitors 
 many ill matters and projects are undertaken and private suits do putrefy the public 
 good many good matters are undertaken with bad minds i mean not only corrupt minds but crafty minds that intend not performance some embrace suits which never mean to deal effectually in them but if they see there may be life in the matter by some other mean they will be content to win a thank or take a second reward or at least to make use in the mean time of the hopes 
 some take hold of suits only for an occasion to cross some other or to make an information whereof they could not otherwise have apt pretext without care what become of the suit when that turn is served or generally to make other business a kind of entertainment to bring in their own nay some undertake suits with a full purpose to let them fall to the end to gratify the adverse party or competitor 
 surely there is in some sort a right in every suit either a right of equity if it be a suit of controversy or a right of desert if it be a suit of petition if affection lead a man to favour the wrong side in justice let him rather use his countenance to compound the matter than to carry it if affection lead a man to favour the less worthy in desert let him do it without depraving or disabling the better deserver in suits which a man doth not well understand it is good to refer them to some friend of trust and judgement that may report whethe he may deal in them with honour but let him choose well his referendaries for else he may be led by the nose 
 suitors are so distasted with delays and abuses that plain dealing in denying to deal in suits at first and reporting the success barely and in challenging no more thanks than one hath deserved is grown not only honourable but also gracious in suits of favour the first coming ought to take little place so far forth consideration may be had of his trust that if intelligence of the matter could not otherwise have been had but by him advantage be not taken of the note but the party left to his other means and in some sort recompensed for his discovery to be ignorant of the value of a suit is simplicity as well as to be ignorant of the right thereof is want of conscience 
 secrecy in suits is a great mean of obtaining for voicing them to be in forwardness may discourage some kind of suitors but doth quicken and awake others but timing of the suit is the principal timing i say not only in respect of the person that should grant it but in respect of those which are like to cross it let a man in the choice of his mean rather choose the fittest mean man the greatest mean and rather them that deal in certain things than those that are general the reparation of a denial is sometimes equal to the first grant if a man show himself neither dejected nor discontented imqwsmpetas utaeqwmferas is a good rule where a man haul strength of favour but otherwise a man were better rise in his suit for he that would have ventured at first to have lost the suitor will not in the conclusion lose both the suitor and his own former favour nothing is thought so basic a request to a great person as his letter and yet if it be not in a good cause it is so much out of his reputation there are no worse instruments than these general contrivers of suits for they are but a kind of poison and infection to public proceedings

 madame success 
 so the widow was good for something 
 but m madeleine had heard nothing of all this 
 life is full of just such combinations of events 
 m madeleine was in the habit of almost never entering the workroom 
 at the head of this room he had placed an elderly spinster whom the priest had provided for him and he had full confidence in this truly respectable person firm equitable upright full of the charity which consists in giving but not having in the same degree that charity which consists in understanding and in forgiving 
 m madeleine relied wholly on her 
 the best men are often obliged to delegate their authority 
 it was with this full power and the conviction that she was doing right that the superintendent had instituted the suit judged condemned and executed fantine 
 as regards the fifty francs she had given them from a fund which m madeleine had intrusted to her for charitable purposes and for giving assistance to the workwomen and of which she rendered no account 
 fantine tried to obtain a situation as a servant in the neighborhood 
 she went from house to house 
 no one would have her 
 she could not leave town 
 the dealer to whom she was in debt for her what to her if you leave i will have you arrested as a thief 
 the householder whom she owed for her rent said to her you are young and pretty you can pay 
 she divided the fifty francs between the landlord and the returned to the latter of his goods kept only necessaries and found herself without work without a trade with nothing but her bed and still about fifty francs in debt 
 she began to make coarse shirts for soldiers of the garrison and earned twelve sous a day 
 her daughter cost her ten 
 it was at this point that she began to pay the thenardiers irregularly 
 however the old woman who lighted her candle for her when she returned at night taught her the art of living in misery back of living on little there is the living on nothing these are the two chambers the first is dark the second is black 
 fantine learned how to live without fire entirely in the winter how to give up a bird which eats a half a worth of millet every two days how to make a coverlet of petticoat and a petticoat of coverlet how to save candle by taking meals by the light of the opposite window no one knows all that certain feeble creatures who have grown old in privation and honesty can get out of a sou 
 it ends by being a talent 
 fantine acquired this sublime talent and regained a little courage 
 at this epoch she said to a neighbor bah 
 i say to myself by only sleeping five hours and working all the rest of the time at my sewing i shall always manage to nearly earn my bread 
 and then when one is sad one eats less 
 well sufferings uneasiness a little bread on one hand trouble on the this will support me 
 it would have been a great happiness to have her little girl with her in this distress 
 she thought of having her come 
 but what then make her share her own destitution 
 and then she was in debt to the thenardiers 
 how could she pay them 
 and the journey how pay for that 
 the old woman who had given her lessons in what may be called the life of indigence was a sainted spinster named marguerite who was pious with a true piety poor and charitable towards the poor and even towards the rich knowing how to write just sufficiently to sign herself marguerite and believing in god which is science 
 there are many such virtuous people in this lower world some day they will be in the world above 
 this life has a morrow 
 at first fantine had been so ashamed that she had not dared to go out 
 when she was in the street she divined that people turned round behind her and pointed at her every one stared at her and no one greeted her the cold and bitter scorn of the penetrated her very flesh and soul like a north wind 
 it seems as though an unfortunate woman were utterly bare beneath the sarcasm and the curiosity of all in small towns 
 in paris at least no one knows you and this obscurity is a garment oh how she would have liked to betake herself to paris 
 impossible 
 she was obliged to accustom herself to disrepute as she had accustomed herself to indigence 
 gradually she decided on her course at the expiration of two or three months she shook off her shame and began to go about as though there were nothing the matter it is all the same to me she said 
 she went and came bearing her head well up with a bitter smile and was conscious that she was becoming 
 madame victurnien sometimes saw her passing from her window noticed the distress of that creature who thanks to her had been put back in her proper place and congratulated herself the happiness of the is black 
 excess of toil wore out fantine and the little dry cough which troubled her increased 
 she sometimes said to her neighbor marguerite just feel how hot my hands are 
 nevertheless when she combed her beautiful hair in the morning with an old broken comb and it flowed about her like floss silk she experienced a moment of happy coquetry

 book two 
 chapter xxi 
 
 the wind had fallen and black clouds merging with the powder smoke hung low over the field of battle on the horizon it was growing dark and the glow of two conflagrations was the more conspicuous the cannonade was dying down but the rattle of musketry behind and on the right sounded oftener and nearer as soon as tushin with his guns continually driving round or coming upon wounded men was out of range of fire and had descended into the dip he was met by some of the staff among them the staff officer and zherkov who had been twice sent to battery but had never reached it interrupting one another they all gave and transmitted orders as to how to proceed reprimanding and reproaching him tushin gave no orders and silently fearing to speak because at every word he felt ready to weep without knowing why rode behind on his artillery nag though the orders were to abandon the wounded many of them dragged themselves after troops and begged for seats on the gun carriages the jaunty infantry officer who just before the battle had rushed out of wattle shed was laid with a bullet in his stomach on carriage at the foot of the hill a pale hussar cadet supporting one hand with the other came up to tushin and asked for a seat 
 captain for sake hurt my arm he said timidly for sake i walk for sake 
 it was plain that this cadet had already repeatedly asked for a lift and been refused he asked in a hesitating piteous voice 
 tell them to give me a seat for sake 
 give him a seat said tushin lay a cloak for him to sit on lad he said addressing his favorite soldier and where is the wounded officer 
 he has been set down he died replied someone 
 help him up sit down dear fellow sit down spread out the cloak antonov 
 the cadet was rostov with one hand he supported the other he was pale and his jaw trembled shivering feverishly he was placed on matvevna the gun from which they had removed the dead officer the cloak they spread under him was wet with blood which stained his breeches and arm 
 what are you wounded my lad said tushin approaching the gun on which rostov sat 
 no a sprain 
 then what is this blood on the gun carriage inquired tushin 
 it was the officer your honor stained it answered the artilleryman wiping away the blood with his coat sleeve as if apologizing for the state of his gun 
 it was all that they could do to get the guns up the rise aided by the infantry and having reached the village of gruntersdorf they halted it had grown so dark that one could not distinguish the uniforms ten paces off and the firing had begun to subside suddenly near by on the right shouting and firing were again heard flashes of shot gleamed in the darkness this was the last french attack and was met by soldiers who had sheltered in the village houses they all rushed out of the village again but guns could not move and the artillerymen tushin and the cadet exchanged silent glances as they awaited their fate the firing died down and soldiers talking eagerly streamed out of a side street 
 not hurt petrov asked one 
 given it em hot mate they make another push now said another 
 you see a thing how they shot at their own fellows nothing could be seen brother there something to drink 
 the french had been repulsed for the last time and again and again in the complete darkness guns moved forward surrounded by the humming infantry as by a frame 
 in the darkness it seemed as though a gloomy unseen river was flowing always in one direction humming with whispers and talk and the sound of hoofs and wheels amid the general rumble the groans and voices of the wounded were more distinctly heard than any other sound in the darkness of the night the gloom that enveloped the army was filled with their groans which seemed to melt into one with the darkness of the night after a while the moving mass became agitated someone rode past on a white horse followed by his suite and said something in passing what did he say where to now halt is it did he thank us came eager questions from all sides the whole moving mass began pressing closer together and a report spread that they were ordered to halt evidently those in front had halted all remained where they were in the middle of the muddy road 
 fires were lighted and the talk became more audible captain tushin having given orders to his company sent a soldier to find a dressing station or a doctor for the cadet and sat down by a bonfire the soldiers had kindled on the road rostov too dragged himself to the fire from pain cold and damp a feverish shivering shook his whole body drowsiness was irresistibly mastering him but he kept awake kept awake by an excruciating pain in his arm for which he could find no satisfactory position he kept closing his eyes and then again looking at the fire which seemed to him dazzlingly red and at the feeble figure of tushin who was sitting like a turk beside him large kind intelligent eyes were fixed with sympathy and commiseration on rostov who saw that tushin with his whole heart wished to help him but could not 
 from all sides were heard the footsteps and talk of the infantry who were walking driving past and settling down all around the sound of voices the tramping feet the horses hoofs moving in mud the crackling of wood fires near and afar merged into one tremulous rumble 
 it was no longer as before a dark unseen river flowing through the gloom but a dark sea swelling and gradually subsiding after a storm rostov looked at and listened listlessly to what passed before and around him an infantryman came to the fire squatted on his heels held his hands to the blaze and turned away his face 
 you mind your honor he asked tushin lost my company your honor i know where such bad luck 
 with the soldier an infantry officer with a bandaged cheek came up to the bonfire and addressing tushin asked him to have the guns moved a trifle to let a wagon go past after he had gone two soldiers rushed to the campfire they were quarreling and fighting desperately each trying to snatch from the other a boot they were both holding on to 
 you picked it up i dare say very smart one of them shouted hoarsely 
 then a thin pale soldier his neck bandaged with a bloodstained leg band came up and in angry tones asked the artillerymen for water 
 must one die like a dog said he 
 tushin told them to give the man some water then a cheerful soldier ran up begging a little fire for the infantry 
 a nice little hot torch for the infantry good luck to you fellow countrymen thanks for the fire return it with interest said he carrying away into the darkness a glowing stick 
 next came four soldiers carrying something heavy on a cloak and passed by the fire one of them stumbled 
 who the devil has put the logs on the road snarled he 
 dead why carry him said another 
 shut up 
 and they disappeared into the darkness with with their load 
 still aching tushin asked rostov in a whisper 
 yes 
 your honor wanted by the general he is in the hut here said a gunner coming up to tushin 
 coming friend 
 tushin rose and buttoning his greatcoat and pulling it straight walked away from the fire 
 not far from the artillery campfire in a hut that had been prepared for him prince bagration sat at dinner talking with some commanding officers who had gathered at his quarters the little old man with the eyes was there greedily gnawing a mutton bone and the general who had served blamelessly for years flushed by a glass of vodka and the dinner and the staff officer with the signet ring and zherkov uneasily glancing at them all and prince andrew pale with compressed lips and feverishly glittering eyes 
 in a corner of the hut stood a standard captured from the french and the accountant with the naive face was feeling its texture shaking his head in perplexity perhaps because the banner really interested him perhaps because it was hard for him hungry as he was to look on at a dinner where there was no place for him in the next hut there was a french colonel who had been taken prisoner by our dragoons our officers were flocking in to look at him prince bagration was thanking the individual commanders and inquiring into details of the action and our losses the general whose regiment had been inspected at braunau was informing the prince that as soon as the action began he had withdrawn from the wood mustered the men who were woodcutting and allowing the french to pass him had made a bayonet charge with two battalions and had broken up the french troops 
 when i saw your excellency that their first battalion was disorganized i stopped in the road and thought let them come on and will meet them with the fire of the whole battalion and what i did 
 the general had so wished to do this and was so sorry he had not managed to do it that it seemed to him as if it had really happened perhaps it might really have been so could one possibly make out amid all that confusion what did or did not happen 
 by the way your excellency i should inform you he continued remembering conversation with kutuzov and his last interview with the that private dolokhov who was reduced to the ranks took a french officer prisoner in my presence and particularly distinguished himself 
 i saw the pavlograd hussars attack there your excellency chimed in zherkov looking uneasily around he had not seen the hussars all that day but had heard about them from an infantry officer they broke up two squares your excellency 
 several of those present smiled at words expecting one of his usual jokes but noticing that what he was saying redounded to the glory of our arms and of the work they assumed a serious expression though many of them knew that what he was saying was a lie devoid of any foundation prince bagration turned to the old colonel 
 gentlemen i thank you all all arms have behaved heroically infantry cavalry and artillery how was it that two guns were abandoned in the center he inquired searching with his eyes for someone prince bagration did not ask about the guns on the left flank he knew that all the guns there had been abandoned at the very beginning of the action i think i sent you he added turning to the staff officer on duty 
 one was damaged answered the staff officer and the other i understand i was there all the time giving orders and had only just left it is true that it was hot there he added modestly 
 someone mentioned that captain tushin was bivouacking close to the village and had already been sent for 
 oh but you were there said prince bagration addressing prince andrew 
 of course we only just missed one another said the staff officer with a smile to bolkonski 
 i had not the pleasure of seeing you said prince andrew coldly and abruptly 
 all were silent tushin appeared at the threshold and made his way timidly from behind the backs of the generals as he stepped past the generals in the crowded hut feeling embarrassed as he always was by the sight of his superiors he did not notice the staff of the banner and stumbled over it several of those present laughed 
 how was it a gun was abandoned asked bagration frowning not so much at the captain as at those who were laughing among whom zherkov laughed loudest 
 only now when he was confronted by the stern authorities did his guilt and the disgrace of having lost two guns and yet remaining alive present themselves to tushin in all their horror he had been so excited that he had not thought about it until that moment the officers laughter confused him still more he stood before bagration with his lower jaw trembling and was hardly able to mutter i know your excellency i had no men your excellency 
 you might have taken some from the covering troops 
 tushin did not say that there were no covering troops though that was perfectly true he was afraid of getting some other officer into trouble and silently fixed his eyes on bagration as a schoolboy who has blundered looks at an examiner 
 the silence lasted some time prince bagration apparently not wishing to be severe found nothing to say the others did not venture to intervene prince andrew looked at tushin from under his brows and his fingers twitched nervously 
 your excellency prince andrew broke the silence with his abrupt voice you were pleased to send me to captain battery i went there and found two thirds of the men and horses knocked out two guns smashed and no supports at all 
 prince bagration and tushin looked with equal intentness at bolkonski who spoke with suppressed agitation 
 and if your excellency will allow me to express my opinion he continued we owe success chiefly to the action of that battery and the heroic endurance of captain tushin and his company and without awaiting a reply prince andrew rose and left the table 
 prince bagration looked at tushin evidently reluctant to show distrust in emphatic opinion yet not feeling able fully to credit it bent his head and told tushin that he could go prince andrew went out with him 
 thank you you saved me my dear fellow said tushin 
 prince andrew gave him a look but said nothing and went away he felt sad and depressed it was all so strange so unlike what he had hoped 
 who are they why are they here what do they want and when will all this end thought rostov looking at the changing shadows before him the pain in his arm became more and more intense irresistible drowsiness overpowered him red rings danced before his eyes and the impression of those voices and faces and a sense of loneliness merged with the physical pain it was they these soldiers wounded and unwounded it was they who were crushing weighing down and twisting the sinews and scorching the flesh of his sprained arm and shoulder to rid himself of them he closed his eyes 
 for a moment he dozed but in that short interval innumerable things appeared to him in a dream his mother and her large white hand thin little shoulders eyes and laughter denisov with his voice and mustache and telyanin and all that affair with telyanin and bogdanich that affair was the same thing as this soldier with the harsh voice and it was that affair and this soldier that were so agonizingly incessantly pulling and pressing his arm and always dragging it in one direction he tried to get away from them but they would not for an instant let his shoulder move a breadth it would not ache it would be well if only they did not pull it but it was immpossible to get rid of them 
 he opened his eyes and looked up the black canopy of night hung less than a yard above the glow of the charcoal flakes of falling snow were fluttering in that light tushin had not returned the doctor had not come he was alone now except for a soldier who was sitting naked at the other side of the fire warming his thin yellow body 
 nobody wants me thought rostov there is no one to help me or pity me yet i was once at home strong happy and loved he sighed and doing so groaned involuntarily 
 eh is anything hurting you asked the soldier shaking his shirt out over the fire and not waiting for an answer he gave a grunt and added what a lot of men have been crippled today frightful 
 rostov did not listen to the soldier he looked at the snowflakes fluttering above the fire and remembered a russian winter at his warm bright home his fluffy fur coat his quickly gliding sleigh his healthy body and all the affection and care of his family and why did i come here he wondered 
 next day the french army did not renew their attack and the remnant of detachment was reunited to army

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the elfin hill 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 a few large lizards were running nimbly about in the clefts of 
 an old tree they could understand one another very well for they 
 spoke the lizard language 
 
 what a buzzing and a rumbling there is in the elfin hill said 
 one of the lizards i have not been able to close my eyes for two 
 nights on account of the noise i might just as well have had the 
 toothache for that always keeps me awake 
 
 there is something going on within there said the other lizard 
 
 they propped up the top of the hill with four red posts till 
 this morning so that it is thoroughly aired and the 
 elfin girls have learnt new dances there is something 
 
 i spoke about it to an of my acquaintance said a 
 third lizard the had just come from the elfin hill where 
 he has been groping about in the earth day and night he has heard a 
 great deal although he cannot see poor miserable creature yet he 
 understands very well how to wriggle and lurk about they expect 
 friends in the elfin hill grand company too but who they are the 
 would not say or perhaps he really did not know all the are ordered to be there to hold a torch dance as it is called the silver and gold which is plentiful in the hill will 
 be polished and placed out in the moonlight 
 
 who can the strangers be asked the lizards what can the 
 matter be hark what a buzzing and humming there is 
 
 just at this moment the elfin hill opened and an old elfin 
 maiden hollow behind came tripping out she was the old elf 
 housekeeper and a distant relative of the family therefore she 
 wore an amber heart on the middle of her forehead her feet moved very fast trip trip good gracious how she could trip right down to the sea to the 
 
 you are invited to the elf hill for this evening said she but 
 will you do me a great favor and undertake the invitations you 
 ought to do something for you have no housekeeping to attend to as 
 i have we are going to have some very grand people conjurors who 
 have always something to say and therefore the old elf king wishes to 
 make a great display 
 
 who is to be invited asked the raven 
 
 all the world may come to the great ball even human beings if 
 they can only talk in their sleep or do something after our 
 fashion but for the feast the company must be carefully selected 
 we can only admit persons of high rank i have had a dispute myself 
 with the elf king as he thought we could not admit ghosts the merman and his daughter must be invited first although it may not be 
 agreeable to them to remain so long on dry land but they shall have a 
 wet stone to sit on or perhaps something better so i think they will 
 not refuse this time we must have all the old demons of the first 
 class with tails and the hobgoblins and imps and then i think we 
 ought not to leave out the or the or even 
 the church dwarf although they do belong to the clergy and are not 
 reckoned among our people but that is merely their office they are 
 nearly related to us and visit us very frequently 
 
 croak said the as he flew away with the invitations 
 
 the elfin maidens already dancing on the elf hill and 
 they danced in shawls woven from moonshine and mist which look very pretty to those who like such things the large hall within the elf 
 hill was splendidly decorated the floor had been washed with 
 moonshine and the walls had been rubbed with magic ointment so 
 that they glowed like in the light in the kitchen were 
 frogs roasting on the spit and dishes preparing of snail skins 
 with fingers in them salad of mushroom seed hemlock 
 noses and marrow of mice beer from the marsh brewery and sparkling wine from the grave cellars these were all 
 substantial food rusty nails and glass formed the 
 dessert the old elf king had his gold crown polished up with powdered it was like that used by the first form and very 
 difficult for an elf king to obtain in the bedrooms curtains were 
 hung up and fastened with the slime of snails there was indeed a 
 buzzing and humming everywhere 
 
 now we must fumigate the place with burnt and 
 bristles and then i think i shall have done my part said the elf 
 
 
 father dear said the youngest daughter may i now hear who 
 our visitors are 
 
 well i suppose i must tell you now he replied two of my 
 daughters must prepare themselves to be married for the marriages 
 certainly will take place the old goblin from norway who lives in 
 the ancient dovre mountains and who possesses many castles built of rock and freestone besides a gold mine which is better than all 
 so it is thought is coming with his two sons who are both seeking 
 a wife the old goblin is a honest old norwegian 
 graybeard cheerful and straightforward i knew him formerly when 
 we used to drink together to our good fellowship he came here once to fetch his wife she is dead now she was the daughter of the king of the at moen they say he took his wife from chalk i shall be delighted to see him again it is said that the boys are 
 forward lads but perhaps that is not quite correct and 
 they will become better as they grow older let me see that you know 
 how to teach them good manners 
 
 and when are they coming asked the daughter 
 
 that depends upon wind and weather said the elf king they 
 travel economically they will come when there is the chance of a 
 ship i wanted them to come over to sweden but the old man was not inclined to take my advice he does not go forward with the times and that i do not like 
 
 two came jumping in one quicker than the other 
 so of course one arrived first they are coming they are coming 
 he cried 
 
 give me my crown said the elf king and let me stand in the 
 moonshine 
 
 the daughters drew on their shawls and bowed down to the ground 
 there stood the old goblin from the dovre mountains with his crown of hardened ice and polished besides this he wore a 
 and great warm boots while his sons went with their 
 throats bare and wore no braces for they were strong men 
 
 is that a hill said the youngest of the boys pointing to the 
 elf hill we should call it a hole in norway 
 
 boys said the old man a hole goes in and a hill stands 
 out have you no eyes in your heads 
 
 another thing they wondered at was that they were able without 
 trouble to understand the language 
 
 take care said the old man or people will think you have 
 not been well brought up 
 
 then they entered the elfin hill where the select and grand 
 company were assembled and so quickly had they appeared that they 
 seemed to have been blown together but for each guest the neatest and pleasantest arrangement had been made the sea folks sat at table in great and they said it was just like being at home all 
 behaved themselves properly excepting the two young northern goblins they put their legs on the table and thought they were all right 
 feet off the said the old goblin they obeyed 
 but not immediately then they tickled the ladies who waited at table 
 with the which they carried in their pockets they took off 
 their boots that they might be more at ease and gave them to the 
 ladies to hold but their father the old goblin was very 
 different he talked pleasantly about the stately norwegian rocks and 
 told fine tales of the waterfalls which dashed over them with a 
 clattering noise like thunder or the sound of an organ spreading 
 their white foam on every side he told of the salmon that leaps in 
 the rushing waters while the plays on his golden harp he 
 spoke of the bright winter nights when the sledge bells are 
 ringing and the boys run with burning torches across the smooth 
 ice which is so transparent that they can see the fishes dart forward 
 beneath their feet he described everything so clearly that those who 
 listened could see it all they could see the going the 
 and the maidens singing songs and dancing a rattling 
 dance when all at once the old goblin gave the old elfin maiden a 
 kiss such a tremendous kiss and yet they were almost strangers to 
 each other 
 
 then the elfin girls had to dance first in the usual way and 
 then with stamping feet which they performed very well then followed the artistic and solo dance dear me how they did throw their legs about no one could tell where the dance begun or where it ended nor indeed which were legs and which were arms for they were all flying about together like the shavings in a and then they spun round so quickly that the and the became sick and giddy and were obliged to leave the table 
 
 stop cried the old goblin is that the only they 
 can perform can they do anything more than dance and throw about 
 their legs and make a whirlwind 
 
 you shall soon see what they can do said the elf king and then 
 he called his youngest daughter to him she was slender and fair as 
 moonlight and the most graceful of all the sisters she took a 
 white chip in her mouth and vanished instantly this was her 
 accomplishment but the old goblin said he should not like his wife to 
 have such an accomplishment and thought his boys would have the 
 same objection another daughter could make a figure like herself 
 follow her as if she had a shadow which none of the goblin folk ever 
 had the third was of quite a different sort she had learnt in the 
 of the moor witch how to lard elfin puddings with 
 
 
 she will make a good housewife said the old goblin and then 
 saluted her with his eyes instead of drinking her health for he did 
 not drink much 
 
 now came the fourth daughter with a large harp to play upon 
 and when she struck the first chord every one lifted up the left 
 leg for the goblins are and at the second chord they 
 found they must all do just what she wanted 
 
 that is a dangerous woman said the old goblin and the two sons 
 walked out of the hill they had had enough of it and what can the 
 next daughter do asked the old goblin 
 
 i have learnt everything that is norwegian said she and i 
 will never marry unless i can go to norway 
 
 then her youngest sister whispered to the old goblin that is 
 only because she has heard in a norwegian song that when the world shall decay the cliffs of norway will remain standing like monuments and she wants to get there that she may be safe for she is so afraid of sinking 
 
 ho ho said the old goblin is that what she means well what 
 can the seventh and last do 
 
 the sixth comes before the seventh said the elf king for he 
 could reckon but the sixth would not come forward 
 
 i can only tell people the truth said she no one cares for 
 me nor troubles himself about me and i have enough to do to sew my grave clothes 
 
 so the seventh and last came and what could she do why she 
 could tell stories as many as you liked on any subject 
 
 here are my five fingers said the old goblin now tell me a 
 story for each of them 
 
 so she took him by the wrist and he laughed till he nearly 
 choked and when she came to the fourth finger there was a gold 
 ring on it as if it knew there was to be a betrothal then the old 
 goblin said hold fast what you have this hand is yours for i 
 will have you for a wife myself 
 
 then the elfin girl said that the stories about the 
 and little peter playman had not yet been told 
 
 we will hear them in the winter said the old goblin and 
 also about the fir and the and the ghost stories and 
 of the tingling frost you shall tell your tales for no one over 
 there can do it so well and we will sit in the stone rooms where the 
 pine logs are burning and drink mead out of the golden of the old norwegian kings the has given me two and when we sit there nix comes to pay us a visit and will sing you all the songs of the mountain shepherdesses how merry we shall be 
 the salmon will be leaping in the waterfalls and dashing against the stone walls but he will not be able to come in it is indeed very pleasant to live in old norway but where are the lads 
 
 where indeed were they why running about the fields and blowing 
 out the who so came and brought 
 their torches 
 
 what tricks have you been playing said the old goblin i 
 have taken a mother for you and now you may take one of your aunts 
 
 but the youngsters said they would rather make a speech and 
 drink to their good fellowship they had no wish to marry then they 
 made speeches and drank toasts and tipped their glasses to show that they were empty then they took off their coats and lay down on the table to sleep for they made themselves quite at home but the old goblin danced about the room with his young bride and exchanged boots with her which is more fashionable than exchanging rings 
 
 the cock is crowing said the old elfin maiden who acted as 
 housekeeper now we must close the shutters that the sun may not 
 scorch us 
 
 then the hill closed up but the lizards continued to run up and 
 down the riven tree and one said to the other oh how much i was 
 pleased with the old goblin 
 
 the boys pleased me better said the but then the 
 poor miserable creature could not see 
 
 the end

the space shuttle challenger tragedy address 
 ronald reagan 
 delivered january 
 ladies and gentlemen planned to speak to you tonight to report on the state of the union but the events of earlier today have led me to change those plans today is a day for mourning and remembering nancy and i are pained to the core by the tragedy of the shuttle challenger we know we share this pain with all of the people of our country this is truly a national loss 
 nineteen years ago almost to the day we lost three astronauts in a terrible accident on the ground but never lost an astronaut in flight never had a tragedy like this and perhaps forgotten the courage it took for the crew of the shuttle but they the challenger seven were aware of the dangers but overcame them and did their jobs brilliantly we mourn seven heroes michael smith dick scobee judith resnik ronald mcnair ellison onizuka gregory jarvis and christa mcauliffe we mourn their loss as a nation together 
 for the families of the seven we cannot bear as you do the full impact of this tragedy but we feel the loss and thinking about you so very much your loved ones were daring and brave and they had that special grace that special spirit that says give me a challenge and meet it with joy they had a hunger to explore the universe and discover its truths they wished to serve and they did they served all of us 
 grown used to wonders in this century hard to dazzle us but for years the united states space program has been doing just that grown used to the idea of space and perhaps we forget that only just begun still pioneers they the members of the challenger crew were pioneers 
 and i want to say something to the schoolchildren of america who were watching the live coverage of the i know hard to understand but sometimes painful things like this happen all part of the process of exploration and discovery all part of taking a chance and expanding horizons the future belong to the fainthearted it belongs to the brave the challenger crew was pulling us into the future and continue to follow them 
 always had great faith in and respect for our space program and what happened today does nothing to diminish it we hide our space program we keep secrets and cover things up we do it all up front and in public the way freedom is and we change it for a minute 
 continue our quest in space there will be more shuttle flights and more shuttle crews and yes more volunteers more civilians more teachers in space nothing ends here our hopes and our journeys continue 
 i want to add that i wish i could talk to every man and woman who works for nasa or who worked on this mission and tell them your dedication and professionalism have moved and impressed us for decades and we know of your anguish we share it 
 a coincidence today on this day three hundred and ninety years ago the great explorer sir francis drake died aboard ship off the coast of panama in his lifetime the great frontiers were the oceans and a historian later said he lived by the sea died on it and was buried in it well today we can say of the challenger crew their dedication was like complete 
 the crew of the space shuttle challenger honored us by the manner in which they lived their lives we will never forget them nor the last time we saw them this morning as they prepared for their journey and waved goodbye and slipped the surly bonds of earth to touch the face of god 
 thank you 
 address to the greater houston ministerial association 
 john f kennedy 
 delivered september at the rice hotel in houston tx 
 reverend meza reverend reck grateful for your generous invitation to state my views 
 while the religious issue is necessarily and properly the chief topic here tonight i want to emphasize from the outset that i believe that we have far more critical issues in the campaign the spread of communist influence until it now festers only miles from the coast of florida the humiliating treatment of our president and vice president by those who no longer respect our power the hungry children i saw in west virginia the old people who cannot pay their doctors bills the families forced to give up their farms an america with too many slums with too few schools and too late to the moon and outer space these are the real issues which should decide this campaign and they are not religious issues for war and hunger and ignorance and despair know no religious barrier 
 but because i am a catholic and no catholic has ever been elected president the real issues in this campaign have been obscured perhaps deliberately in some quarters less responsible than this so it is apparently necessary for me to state once again not what kind of church i believe in for that should be important only to me but what kind of america i believe in 
 i believe in an america where the separation of church and state is absolute where no catholic prelate would tell the president should he be catholic how to act and no protestant minister would tell his parishioners for whom to vote where no church or church school is granted any public funds or political preference and where no man is denied public office merely because his religion differs from the president who might appoint him or the people who might elect him 
 i believe in an america that is officially neither catholic protestant nor jewish where no public official either requests or accept instructions on public policy from the pope the national council of churches or any other ecclesiastical source where no religious body seeks to impose its will directly or indirectly upon the general populace or the public acts of its officials and where religious liberty is so indivisible that an act against one church is treated as an act against all 
 for while this year it may be a catholic against whom the finger of suspicion is pointed in other years it has been and may someday be again a jew or a quaker or a unitarian or a baptist it was harassment of baptist preachers for example that led to statute of religious freedom today i may be the victim but tomorrow it may be you until the whole fabric of our harmonious society is ripped apart at a time of great national peril 
 finally i believe in an america where religious intolerance will someday end where all men and all churches are treated as equals where every man has the same right to attend or not to attend the church of his choice where there is no catholic vote no vote no bloc voting of any kind and where catholics protestants and jews at both the lay and the pastoral levels will refrain from those attitudes of disdain and division which have so often marred their works in the past and promote instead the american ideal of brotherhood 
 that is the kind of america in which i believe and it represents the kind of presidency in which i believe a great office that must be neither humbled by making it the instrument of any religious group nor tarnished by arbitrarily withholding its occupancy from the members of any one religious group i believe in a president whose views on religion are his own private affair neither imposed upon him by the nation nor imposed by the nation upon him sic as a condition to holding that office 
 i would not look with favor upon a president working to subvert the first guarantees of religious liberty nor would our system of checks and balances permit him to do so and neither do i look with favor upon those who would work to subvert article vi of the constitution by requiring a religious test even by indirection for if they disagree with that safeguard they should be out openly working to repeal it 
 i want a chief executive whose public acts are responsible to all and obligated to none who can attend any ceremony service or dinner his office may appropriately require of him to fulfill and whose fulfillment of his presidential office is not limited or conditioned by any religious oath ritual or obligation 
 this is the kind of america i believe in and this is the kind of america i fought for in the south pacific and the kind my brother died for in europe no one suggested then that we might have a divided loyalty that we did not believe in liberty or that we belonged to a disloyal group that threatened the freedoms for which our forefathers died 
 and in fact this is the kind of america for which our forefathers did when they fled here to escape religious test oaths that denied office to members of less favored churches when they fought for the constitution the bill of rights the virginia statute of religious freedom and when they fought at the shrine i visited today the alamo for side by side with bowie and crockett died fuentes and mccafferty and bailey and badillo and carey but no one knows whether they were catholics or not for there was no religious test there 
 i ask you tonight to follow in that tradition to judge me on the basis of years in the congress on my declared stands against an ambassador to the vatican against unconstitutional aid to parochial schools and against any boycott of the public schools which i attended myself and instead of doing this do not judge me on the basis of these pamphlets and publications we all have seen that carefully select quotations out of context from the statements of catholic church leaders usually in other countries frequently in other centuries and rarely relevant to any situation here and always omitting of course the statement of the american bishops in which strongly endorsed separation and which more nearly reflects the views of almost every american catholic 
 i do not consider these other quotations binding upon my public acts why should you 
 but let me say with respect to other countries that i am wholly opposed to the state being used by any religious group catholic or protestant to compel prohibit or prosecute the free exercise of any other religion and that goes for any persecution at any time by anyone in any country and i hope that you and i condemn with equal fervor those nations which deny their presidency to protestants and those which deny it to catholics and rather than cite the misdeeds of those who differ i would also cite the record of the catholic church in such nations as france and ireland and the independence of such statesmen as de gaulle and adenauer 
 but let me stress again that these are my views 
 for contrary to common newspaper usage i am not the catholic candidate for president 
 i am the democratic candidate for president who happens also to be a catholic 
 i do not speak for my church on public matters and the church does not speak for me whatever issue may come before me as president if i should be elected on birth control divorce censorship gambling or any other subject i will make my decision in accordance with these views in accordance with what my conscience tells me to be in the national interest and without regard to outside religious pressure or dictates and no power or threat of punishment could cause me to decide otherwise 
 but if the time should ever come and i do not concede any conflict to be remotely possible when my office would require me to either violate my conscience or violate the national interest then i would resign the office and i hope any conscientious public servant would do likewise 
 but i do not intend to apologize for these views to my critics of either catholic or protestant faith nor do i intend to disavow either my views or my church in order to win this election 
 if i should lose on the real issues i shall return to my seat in the senate satisfied that tried my best and was fairly judged 
 but if this election is decided on the basis that million americans lost their chance of being president on the day they were baptized then it is the whole nation that will be the loser in the eyes of catholics and around the world in the eyes of history and in the eyes of our own people 
 but if on the other hand i should win this election then i shall devote every effort of mind and spirit to fulfilling the oath of the presidency practically identical i might add with the oath i have taken for years in the congress for without reservation i can solemnly swear that i will faithfully execute the office of president of the united states and will to the best of my ability preserve protect and defend the constitution so help me god 
 
 an redundancy antimetabole kennedy probably meant to say neither imposed by him upon the nation nor imposed by the nation upon him 
 
 we shall overcome 
 lyndon baines johnson 
 delivered march 
 mr speaker mr president members of the congress 
 i speak tonight for the dignity of man and the destiny of democracy i urge every member of both parties americans of all religions and of all colors from every section of this country to join me in that cause 
 at times history and fate meet at a single time in a single place to shape a turning point in unending search for freedom so it was at lexington and concord so it was a century ago at appomattox so it was last week in selma alabama there men and women peacefully protested the denial of their rights as americans many were brutally assaulted one good man a man of god was killed 
 there is no cause for pride in what has happened in selma there is no cause for in the long denial of equal rights of millions of americans but there is cause for hope and for faith in our democracy in what is happening here tonight for the cries of pain and the hymns and protests of oppressed people have summoned into convocation all the majesty of this great government the government of the greatest nation on earth our mission is at once the oldest and the most basic of this country to right wrong to do justice to serve man 
 in our time we have come to live with the moments of great crisis our lives have been marked with debate about great issues issues of war and peace issues of prosperity and depression but rarely in any time does an issue lay bare the secret heart of america itself rarely are we met with a challenge not to our growth or abundance or our welfare or our security but rather to the values and the purposes and the meaning of our beloved nation 
 the issue of equal rights for american negroes is such an issue 
 and should we defeat every enemy and should we double our wealth and conquer the stars and still be unequal to this issue then we will have failed as a people and as a nation for with a country as with a person what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul 
 there is no negro problem there is no southern problem there is no northern problem there is only an american problem and we are met here tonight as americans not as democrats or republicans we are met here as americans to solve that problem 
 this was the first nation in the history of the world to be founded with a purpose the great phrases of that purpose still sound in every american heart north and south all men are created equal government by consent of the governed give me liberty or give me death well those are not just clever words or those are not just empty theories in their name americans have fought and died for two centuries and tonight around the world they stand there as guardians of our liberty risking their lives 
 those words are a promise to every citizen that he shall share in the dignity of man this dignity cannot be found in a possessions it cannot be found in his power or in his position it really rests on his right to be treated as a man equal in opportunity to all others it says that he shall share in freedom he shall choose his leaders educate his children provide for his family according to his ability and his merits as a human being to apply any other test to deny a man his hopes because of his color or race or his religion or the place of his birth is not only to do injustice it is to deny america and to dishonor the dead who gave their lives for american freedom 
 our fathers believed that if this noble view of the rights of man was to flourish it must be rooted in democracy the most basic right of all was the right to choose your own leaders the history of this country in large measure is the history of the expansion of that right to all of our people many of the issues of civil rights are very complex and most difficult but about this there can and should be no argument 
 every american citizen must have an equal right to vote 
 there is no reason which can excuse the denial of that right there is no duty which weighs more heavily on us than the duty we have to ensure that right 
 yet the harsh fact is that in many places in this country men and women are kept from voting simply because they are negroes every device of which human ingenuity is capable has been used to deny this right the negro citizen may go to register only to be told that the day is wrong or the hour is late or the official in charge is absent and if he persists and if he manages to present himself to the registrar he may be disqualified because he did not spell out his middle name or because he abbreviated a word on the application and if he manages to fill out an application he is given a test the registrar is the sole judge of whether he passes this test he may be asked to recite the entire constitution or explain the most complex provisions of state law and even a college degree cannot be used to prove that he can read and write 
 for the fact is that the only way to pass these barriers is to show a white skin experience has clearly shown that the existing process of law cannot overcome systematic and ingenious discrimination no law that we now have on the books and i have helped to put three of them there can ensure the right to vote when local officials are determined to deny it in such a case our duty must be clear to all of us the constitution says that no person shall be kept from voting because of his race or his color we have all sworn an oath before god to support and to defend that constitution we must now act in obedience to that oath 
 wednesday i will send to congress a law designed to eliminate illegal barriers to the right to vote 
 the broad principles of that bill will be in the hands of the democratic and republican leaders tomorrow after they have reviewed it it will come here formally as a bill i am grateful for this opportunity to come here tonight at the invitation of the leadership to reason with my friends to give them my views and to visit with my former colleagues had prepared a more comprehensive analysis of the legislation which i had intended to transmit to the clerk tomorrow but which i will submit to the clerks tonight but i want to really discuss with you now briefly the main proposals of this legislation 
 this bill will strike down restrictions to voting in all elections federal state and local which have been used to deny negroes the right to vote this bill will establish a simple uniform standard which cannot be used however ingenious the effort to flout our constitution it will provide for citizens to be registered by officials of the united states government if the state officials refuse to register them it will eliminate tedious unnecessary lawsuits which delay the right to vote finally this legislation will ensure that properly registered individuals are not prohibited from voting 
 i will welcome the suggestions from all of the members of congress i have no doubt that i will get some on ways and means to strengthen this law and to make it effective but experience has plainly shown that this is the only path to carry out the command of the constitution 
 to those who seek to avoid action by their national government in their own communities who want to and who seek to maintain purely local control over elections the answer is simple open your polling places to all your people 
 allow men and women to register and vote whatever the color of their skin 
 extend the rights of citizenship to every citizen of this land 
 there is no constitutional issue here the command of the constitution is plain there is no moral issue it is wrong deadly wrong to deny any of your fellow americans the right to vote in this country there is no issue of states rights or national rights there is only the struggle for human rights i have not the slightest doubt what will be your answer 
 but the last time a president sent a civil rights bill to the congress it contained a provision to protect voting rights in federal elections that civil rights bill was passed after eight long months of debate and when that bill came to my desk from the congress for my signature the heart of the voting provision had been eliminated this time on this issue there must be no delay or no hesitation or no compromise with our purpose 
 we cannot we must not refuse to protect the right of every american to vote in every election that he may desire to participate in and we ought not and we cannot and we must not wait another eight months before we get a bill we have already waited a hundred years and more and the time for waiting is gone 
 so i ask you to join me in working long hours nights and weekends if necessary to pass this bill and i make that request lightly for from the window where i sit with the problems of our country i recognize that from outside this chamber is the outraged conscience of a nation the grave concern of many nations and the harsh judgment of history on our acts 
 but even if we pass this bill the battle will not be over what happened in selma is part of a far larger movement which reaches into every section and state of america it is the effort of american negroes to secure for themselves the full blessings of american life their cause must be our cause too because not just negroes but really all of us who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice 
 and we shall overcome 
 as a man whose roots go deeply into southern soil i know how agonizing racial feelings are i know how difficult it is to reshape the attitudes and the structure of our society but a century has passed more than a hundred years since the negro was freed and he is not fully free tonight 
 it was more than a hundred years ago that abraham lincoln a great president of another party signed the emancipation proclamation but emancipation is a proclamation and not a fact a century has passed more than a hundred years since equality was promised and yet the negro is not equal a century has passed since the day of promise and the promise is 
 the time of justice has now come i tell you that i believe sincerely that no force can hold it back it is right in the eyes of man and god that it should come and when it does i think that day will brighten the lives of every american for negroes are not the only victims how many white children have gone uneducated how many white families have lived in stark poverty how many white lives have been scarred by fear because wasted our energy and our substance to maintain the barriers of hatred and terror 
 and so i say to all of you here and to all in the nation tonight that those who appeal to you to hold on to the past do so at the cost of denying you your future 
 this great rich restless country can offer opportunity and education and hope to all all black and white all north and south sharecropper and city dweller these are the enemies poverty ignorance disease our enemies not our fellow man not our neighbor and these enemies too poverty disease and ignorance we shall overcome 
 now let none of us in any section look with prideful righteousness on the troubles in another section or the problems of our neighbors really no part of america where the promise of equality has been fully kept in buffalo as well as in birmingham in philadelphia as well as selma americans are struggling for the fruits of freedom this is one nation what happens in selma or in cincinnati is a matter of legitimate concern to every american but let each of us look within our own hearts and our own communities and let each of us put our shoulder to the wheel to root out injustice wherever it exists 
 as we meet here in this peaceful historic chamber tonight men from the south some of whom were at iwo jima men from the north who have carried old glory to far corners of the world and brought it back without a stain on it men from the east and from the west are all fighting together without regard to religion or color or region in vietnam men from every region fought for us across the world twenty years ago 
 and now in these common dangers and these common sacrifices the south made its contribution of honor and gallantry no less than any other region in the great republic and in some instances a great many of them more 
 and i have not the slightest doubt that good men from everywhere in this country from the great lakes to the gulf of mexico from the golden gate to the harbors along the atlantic will rally now together in this cause to vindicate the freedom of all americans 
 for all of us owe this duty and i believe that all of us will respond to it your president makes that request of every american 
 the real hero of this struggle is the american negro his actions and protests his courage to risk safety and even to risk his life have awakened the conscience of this nation his demonstrations have been designed to call attention to injustice designed to provoke change designed to stir reform he has called upon us to make good the promise of america and who among us can say that we would have made the same progress were it not for his persistent bravery and his faith in american democracy 
 for at the real heart of battle for equality is a deep seated belief in the democratic process equality depends not on the force of arms or tear gas but depends upon the force of moral right not on recourse to violence but on respect for law and order 
 and there have been many pressures upon your president and there will be others as the days come and go but i pledge you tonight that we intend to fight this battle where it should be fought in the courts and in the congress and in the hearts of men 
 we must preserve the right of free speech and the right of free assembly but the right of free speech does not carry with it as has been said the right to holler fire in a crowded theater we must preserve the right to free assembly but free assembly does not carry with it the right to block public thoroughfares to traffic 
 we do have a right to protest and a right to march under conditions that do not infringe the constitutional rights of our neighbors and i intend to protect all those rights as long as i am permitted to serve in this office 
 we will guard against violence knowing it strikes from our hands the very weapons which we seek progress obedience to law and belief in american values 
 in selma as elsewhere we seek and pray for peace we seek order we seek unity but we will not accept the peace of stifled rights or the order imposed by fear or the unity that stifles protest for peace cannot be purchased at the cost of liberty 
 in selma tonight and we had a good day there as in every city we are working for a just and peaceful settlement and we must all remember that after this speech i am making tonight after the police and the fbi and the marshals have all gone and after you have promptly passed this bill the people of selma and the other cities of the nation must still live and work together and when the attention of the nation has gone elsewhere they must try to heal the wounds and to build a new community 
 this cannot be easily done on a battleground of violence as the history of the south itself shows it is in recognition of this that men of both races have shown such an outstandingly impressive responsibility in recent days last tuesday again today 
 the bill that i am presenting to you will be known as a civil rights bill but in a larger sense most of the program i am recommending is a civil rights program its object is to open the city of hope to all people of all races 
 because all americans just must have the right to vote and we are going to give them that right all americans must have the privileges of citizenship regardless of race and they are going to have those privileges of citizenship regardless of race 
 but i would like to caution you and remind you that to exercise these privileges takes much more than just legal right it requires a trained mind and a healthy body it requires a decent home and the chance to find a job and the opportunity to escape from the clutches of poverty 
 of course people cannot contribute to the nation if they are never taught to read or write if their bodies are stunted from hunger if their sickness goes untended if their life is spent in hopeless poverty just drawing a welfare check so we want to open the gates to opportunity but also going to give all our people black and white the help that they need to walk through those gates 
 my first job after college was as a teacher in cotulla texas in a small school few of them could speak english and i speak much spanish my students were poor and they often came to class without breakfast hungry and they knew even in their youth the pain of prejudice they never seemed to know why people disliked them but they knew it was so because i saw it in their eyes i often walked home late in the afternoon after the classes were finished wishing there was more that i could do but all i knew was to teach them the little that i knew hoping that it might help them against the hardships that lay ahead 
 and somehow you never forget what poverty and hatred can do when you see its scars on the hopeful face of a young child i never thought then in that i would be standing here in it never even occurred to me in my fondest dreams that i might have the chance to help the sons and daughters of those students and to help people like them all over this country 
 but now i do have that chance and let you in on a secret i mean to use it 
 and i hope that you will use it with me 
 this is the richest and the most powerful country which ever occupied this globe the might of past empires is little compared to ours but i do not want to be the president who built empires or sought grandeur or extended dominion 
 i want to be the president who educated young children to the wonders of their world 
 i want to be the president who helped to feed the hungry and to prepare them to be instead of 
 i want to be the president who helped the poor to find their own way and who protected the right of every citizen to vote in every election 
 i want to be the president who helped to end hatred among his fellow men and who promoted love among the people of all races and all regions and all parties 
 i want to be the president who helped to end war among the brothers of this earth 
 and so at the request of your beloved speaker and the senator from montana the majority leader the senator from illinois the minority leader mr mcculloch and other members of both parties i came here tonight not as president roosevelt came down one time in person to veto a bonus bill not as president truman came down one time to urge the passage of a railroad bill but i came down here to ask you to share this task with me and to share it with the people that we both work for i want this to be the congress republicans and democrats alike which did all these things for all these people 
 beyond this great chamber out yonder in fifty states are the people that we serve who can tell what deep and unspoken hopes are in their hearts tonight as they sit there and listen we all can guess from our own lives how difficult they often find their own pursuit of happiness how many problems each little family has they look most of all to themselves for their futures but i think that they also look to each of us 
 above the pyramid on the great seal of the united states it says in latin god has favored our undertaking god will not favor everything that we do it is rather our duty to divine his will 
 but i cannot help believing that he truly understands and that he really favors the undertaking that we begin here tonight 
 
 
 a tale of two cities 
 mario cuomo 
 delivered july to at democratic national convention san francisco 
 on behalf of the empire state and the family of new york i thank you for the great privilege of being able to address this convention please allow me to skip the stories and the poetry and the temptation to deal in nice but vague rhetoric let me instead use this valuable opportunity to deal immediately with questions that should determine this election and that we all know are vital to the american people 
 ten days ago president reagan admitted that although some people in this country seemed to be doing well nowadays others were unhappy even worried about themselves their families and their futures the president said that he understand that fear he said why this country is a shining city on a hill and the president is right in many ways we are a shining city on a hill 
 but the hard truth is that not everyone is sharing in this splendor and glory a shining city is perhaps all the president sees from the portico of the white house and the veranda of his ranch where everyone seems to be doing well but another city another part to the shining the city the part where some people pay their mortgages and most young people afford one where students afford the education they need and parents watch the dreams they hold for their children evaporate 
 in this part of the city there are more poor than ever more families in trouble more and more people who need help but find it even worse there are elderly people who tremble in the basements of the houses there and there are people who sleep in the city streets in the gutter where the glitter show there are ghettos where thousands of young people without a job or an education give their lives away to drug dealers every day there is despair mr president in the faces that you see in the places that you visit in your shining city 
 in fact mr president this is a nation mr president you ought to know that this nation is more a tale of two cities than it is just a shining city on a hill 
 maybe maybe mr president if you visited some more places maybe if you went to appalachia where some people still live in sheds maybe if you went to lackawanna where thousands of unemployed steel workers wonder why we subsidized foreign steel maybe maybe mr president if you stopped in at a shelter in chicago and spoke to the homeless there maybe mr president if you asked a woman who had been denied the help she needed to feed her children because you said you needed the money for a tax break for a millionaire or for a missile we afford to use 
 maybe maybe mr president but afraid not 
 because the truth is ladies and gentlemen that this is how we were warned it would be president reagan told us from very the beginning that he believed in a kind of social darwinism survival of the fittest government do everything we were told so it should settle for taking care of the strong and hope that economic ambition and charity will do the rest make the rich richer and what falls from their table will be enough for the middle class and those who are trying desperately to work their way into the middle class 
 you know the republicans called it when hoover tried it now they call it supply side but the same shining city for those relative few who are lucky enough to live in its good neighborhoods but for the people who are excluded for the people who are locked out all they can do is to stare from a distance at that glimmering towers 
 an old story as old as our history the difference between democrats and republicans has always been measured in courage and confidence the republicans believe that the wagon train will not make it to the frontier unless some of the old some of the young some of the weak are left behind by the side of the trail the strong the strong they tell us will inherit the land 
 we democrats believe in something else we democrats believe that we can make it all the way with the whole family intact and we have more than once ever since franklin roosevelt lifted himself from his wheelchair to lift this nation from its knees wagon train after wagon train to new frontiers of education housing peace the whole family aboard constantly reaching out to extend and enlarge that family lifting them up into the wagon on the way blacks and hispanics and people of every ethnic group and native americans all those struggling to build their families and claim some small share of america 
 for nearly years we carried them all to new levels of comfort and security and dignity even affluence and remember this some of us in this room today are here only because this nation had that kind of confidence and it would be wrong to forget that 
 so here we are at this convention to remind ourselves where we come from and to claim the future for ourselves and for our children today our great democratic party which has saved this nation from depression from fascism from racism from corruption is called upon to do it again this time to save the nation from confusion and division from the threat of eventual fiscal disaster and most of all from the fear of a nuclear holocaust 
 not going to be easy mo udall is exactly right not going to be easy in order to succeed we must answer our polished and appealing rhetoric with a more telling reasonableness and rationality 
 we must win this case on the merits we must get the american public to look past the glitter beyond the showmanship to reality to the hard substance of things and we will do that not so much with speeches that sound good as with speeches that are good and sound not so much with speeches that will bring people to their feet as with speeches that bring people to their senses we must make the american people hear our tale of two cities we must convince them that we have to settle for two cities that we can have one city indivisible shining for all of its people 
 now we will have no chance to do that if what comes out of this convention is a babel of arguing voices if heard throughout the campaign dissident voices from all sides we will have no chance to tell our message to succeed we will have to surrender small parts of our individual interests to build a platform we can all stand on at once comfortably proudly singing out the truth for the nation to hear in chorus its logic so clear and commanding that no slick commercial no amount of geniality no martial music will be able to muffle the sound of the truth we democrats must unite 
 we democrats must unite so that the entire nation can unite because surely the republicans bring this country together their policies divide the nation into the lucky and the into the royalty and the rabble the republicans are willing to treat that division as victory they would cut this nation in half into those temporarily better off and those worse off than before and they would call that division recovery 
 we should not we should not be embarrassed or dismayed or chagrined if the process of unifying is difficult even wrenching at times remember that unlike any other party we embrace men and women of every color every creed every orientation every economic class in our family are gathered everyone from the abject poor of essex county in new york to the enlightened affluent of the gold coasts at both ends of the nation and in between is the heart of our constituency the middle class the people not rich enough to be but not poor enough to be on welfare the middle class those people who work for a living because they have to not because some psychiatrist told them it was a convenient way to fill the interval between birth and eternity white collar and blue collar young professionals men and women in small business desperate for the capital and contracts that they need to prove their worth 
 we speak for the minorities who have not yet entered the mainstream we speak for ethnics who want to add their culture to the magnificent mosaic that is america we speak we speak for women who are indignant that this nation refuses to etch into its governmental commandments the simple rule thou shalt not sin against equality a rule so simple i was going to say and i perhaps dare not but i will a commandment so simple it can be spelled in three letters 
 we speak for young people demanding an education and a future we speak for senior citizens who are terrorized by the idea that their only security their social security is being threatened we speak for millions of reasoning people fighting to preserve our environment from greed and from stupidity and we speak for reasonable people who are fighting to preserve our very existence from a macho intransigence that refuses to make intelligent attempts to discuss the possibility of nuclear holocaust with our enemy they refuse they refuse because they believe we can pile missiles so high that they will pierce the clouds and the sight of them will frighten our enemies into submission 
 now proud of this diversity as democrats grateful for it we have to manufacture it the way the republicans will next month in dallas by propping up mannequin delegates on the convention floor but while proud of this diversity as democrats we pay a price for it the different people that we represent have different points of view and sometimes they compete and even debate and even argue what our primaries were all about but now the primaries are over and it is time when we pick our candidates and our platform here to lock arms and move into this campaign together if you need any more inspiration to put some small part of your own differences aside to create this consensus all you need to do is to reflect on what the republican policy of divide and cajole has done to this land since 
 now the president has asked us to judge him on whether or not fulfilled the promise he made four years ago i believe that as democrats we ought to accept that challenge and just for a moment let us consider what he has said and what done inflation is down since but not because of the supply side miracle promised to us by the president inflation was reduced the way with a recession the worst since we could have brought inflation down that way how did he do it thousand bankruptcies two years of massive unemployment two hundred thousand farmers and ranchers forced off the land more homeless than at any time since the great depression in more hungry in this nation of enormous affluence the united states of america more hungry more poor most of them women and he paid one more thing a nearly billion deficit threatening our future 
 now we must make the american people understand this deficit because they the deficit is a direct and dramatic repudiation of his promise to balance our budget by how large is it the deficit is the largest in the history of this universe president last budget had a deficit of less than of this deficit it is a deficit that according to the own fiscal adviser may grow as high as billion a year for as far as the eye can see 
 and ladies and gentlemen it is a debt so large that as much as of our revenue from the income tax goes just to pay the interest it is a mortgage on our future that can be paid only in pain and that could bring this nation to its knees 
 now take my word for it a democrat 
 ask the republican investment bankers on wall street what they think the chances of this recovery being permanent are you see if not too embarrassed to tell you the truth say that they are appalled and frightened by the deficit ask them what they think of our economy now that it has been driven by the distorted value of the dollar back to its colonial condition now exporting agricultural products and importing manufactured ones ask those republican investment bankers what they expect the rate of interest to be a year from now and ask them if they dare tell you the truth you will hear from them what they predict for the inflation rate a year from now because of the deficit 
 now how important is this question of the deficit 
 think about it practically what chance would the republican candidate have had in if he had told the american people that he intended to pay for his economic recovery with bankruptcies unemployment more homeless more hungry and the largest government debt known to humankind would american voters have signed the loan certificate for him on election day of course not that was an election won under false pretenses it was won with smoke and mirrors and illusions and the kind of recovery we have now as well 
 and what about foreign policy they said that they would make us and the whole world safer they say they have by creating the largest defense budget in history one that even they now admit is excessive by escalating to a frenzy the nuclear arms race by incendiary rhetoric by refusing to discuss peace with our enemies by the loss of young americans in lebanon in pursuit of a plan and a policy that no one can find or describe 
 we give money to latin american governments that murder nuns and then we lie about it we have been less than zealous in support of our only real friend it seems to me we have in the middle east the one democracy there our flesh and blood ally the state of israel our foreign policy drifts with no real direction other than an hysterical commitment to an arms race that leads nowhere if lucky and if not it could lead us into bankruptcy or war 
 of course we must have a strong defense 
 of course democrats are for a strong defense of course democrats believe that there are times when we must stand and fight and we have thousands of us have paid for freedom with our lives but always when this country has been at its best our purposes were clear now not now our allies are as confused as our enemies now we have no real commitment to our friends or to our ideals not to human rights not to the refuseniks not to sakharov not to bishop tutu and the others struggling for freedom in south africa 
 we have in the last few years spent more than we can afford we have pounded our chests and made bold speeches but we lost young americans in lebanon and we live behind sand bags in washington how can anyone say that we are stronger safer or better 
 that is the republican record 
 that its disastrous quality is not more fully understood by the american people i can only attribute to the amiability and the failure by some to separate the salesman from the product 
 and now up to us now now up to you and me to make the case to america and to remind americans that if they are not happy with all the president has done so far they should consider how much worse it will be if he is left to his radical proclivities for another four years unrestrained unrestrained 
 if july brings back ann gorsuch burford what can we expect of december where would another four years take us where would four years more take us how much larger will the deficit be how much deeper the cuts in programs for the struggling middle class and the poor to limit that deficit how high will the interest rates be how much more acid rain killing our forests and fouling our lakes and ladies and gentlemen the nation must think of this what kind of supreme court will we have we must ask ourselves what kind of court and country will be fashioned by the man who believes in having government mandate religion and morality 
 the man who believes that trees pollute the environment the man that believes that the laws against discrimination against people go too far the man who threatens social security and medicaid and help for the disabled how high will we pile the missiles how much deeper will the gulf be between us and our enemies and ladies and gentlemen will four years more make meaner the spirit of the american people 
 this election will measure the record of the past four years but more than that it will answer the question of what kind of people we want to be 
 we democrats still have a dream we still believe in this future and this is our answer to the question this is our credo 
 we believe in only the government we need but we insist on all the government we need we believe in a government that is characterized by fairness and reasonableness a reasonableness that goes beyond labels that distort or promise things that we know we believe in a government strong enough to use the words love and compassion and smart enough to convert our noblest aspirations into practical realities we believe in encouraging the talented but we believe that while survival of the fittest may be a good working description of the process of evolution a government of humans should elevate itself to a higher order 
 our government should be able to rise to the level to where it can fill the gaps left by chance or a wisdom we fully understand we would rather have laws written by the patron of this great city the man called the most sincere democrat st francis of assisi than laws written by darwin 
 we believe we believe as democrats that a society as blessed as ours the most affluent democracy in the history one that can spend trillions on instruments of destruction ought to be able to help the middle class in its struggle ought to be able to find work for all who can do it room at the table shelter for the homeless care for the elderly and infirm and hope for the destitute and we proclaim as loudly as we can the utter insanity of nuclear proliferation and the need for a nuclear freeze if only to affirm the simple truth that peace is better than war because life is better than death 
 we believe in firm but fair law and order we believe proudly in the union movement we believe in privacy for people openness by government we believe in civil rights and we believe in human rights we believe in a single fundamental idea that describes better than most textbooks and any speech that i could write what a proper government should be the idea of family mutuality the sharing of benefits and burdens for the good of all feeling one pain sharing one blessings reasonably honestly fairly without respect to race or sex or geography or political affiliation 
 we believe we must be the family of america recognizing that at the heart of the matter we are bound one to another that the problems of a retired school teacher in duluth are our problems that the future of the child in buffalo is our future that the struggle of a disabled man in boston to survive and live decently is our struggle that the hunger of a woman in little rock is our hunger that the failure anywhere to provide what reasonably we might to avoid pain is our failure 
 now for years for years we democrats created a better future for our children using traditional democratic principles as a fixed beacon giving us direction and purpose but constantly innovating adapting to new realities alphabet programs nato and the gi bill of rights intelligent tax incentives and the alliance for progress civil rights human rights and the nearly miraculous camp david peace accord 
 democrats did it democrats did it and democrats can do it again we can build a future that deals with our deficit remember this that years of progress under our principles never cost us what the last four years of stagnation have and we can deal with the deficit intelligently by shared sacrifice with all parts of the family contributing building partnerships with the private sector providing a sound defense without depriving ourselves of what we need to feed our children and care for our people 
 we can have a future that provides for all the young of the present by marrying common sense and compassion we know we can because we did it for nearly years before 
 and we can do it again if we do not forget if we do not forget that this entire nation has profited by these progressive principles that they helped lift up generations to the middle class and higher gave us a chance to work to go to college to raise a family to own a house to be secure in our old age and before that to reach heights that our own parents would not have dared dream of 
 that struggle to live with dignity is the real story of the shining city and a story ladies and gentlemen that i read in a book or learn in a classroom i saw it and lived it like many of you i watched a small man with thick calluses on both hands work and hours a day i saw him once literally bleed from the bottoms of his feet a man who came here uneducated alone unable to speak the language who taught me all i needed to know about faith and hard work by the simple eloquence of his example i learned about our kind of democracy from my father and i learned about our obligation to each other from him and from my mother they asked only for a chance to work and to make the world better for their children and they asked to be protected in those moments when they would not be able to protect themselves this nation and this government did that for them 
 and that they were able to build a family and live in dignity and see one of their children go from behind their little grocery store in south jamaica on the other side of the tracks where he was born to occupy the highest seat in the greatest state of the greatest nation in the only world we know is an ineffably beautiful tribute to the democratic process 
 and ladies and gentlemen on january it will happen again only on a much much grander scale we will have a new president of the united states a democrat born not to the blood of kings but to the blood of pioneers and immigrants and we will have first woman vice president the child of immigrants and she she she will open with one magnificent stroke a whole new frontier for the united states now it will happen 
 it will happen if we make it happen if you and i can make it happen 
 and i ask you now ladies and gentlemen brothers and sisters for the good of all of us for the love of this great nation for the family of america for the love of god please make this nation remember how futures are built 
 thank you and god bless you 


 
 
 
 part five 
 chapter 
 
 princess shcherbatskaia considered that it was out of the question for the wedding to take place before lent just five weeks off since not half the trousseau could possibly be ready by that time but she could not but agree with levin that to fix it for after lent would be putting it off too late as an old aunt of prince was seriously ill and might die and then the mourning would delay the wedding still longer and therefore deciding to divide the trousseau into two parts a larger and a smaller trousseau the princess consented to have the wedding before lent she determined that she would get the smaller part of the trousseau all ready now and the larger part should be sent on later and she was much vexed with levin because he was incapable of giving her a serious answer to the question whether he agreed to this arrangement or not the arrangement was the more suitable as immediately after the wedding the newly married couple were to go to the country where the belongings of the larger trousseau would not be wanted 
 levin still continued in the same delirious condition in which it seemed to him that he and his happiness constituted the chief and sole aim of all existence and that he need not now think or care about anything that everything was being done and would be done for him by others he had not even plans and aims for the future he left its arrangement to others knowing that everything would be delightful his brother sergei ivanovich and stepan arkadyevich and the princess guided him in doing what he had to do all he did was to agree entirely with everything suggested to him his brother raised money for him the princess advised him to leave moscow after the wedding stepan arkadyevich advised him to go abroad he agreed to everything do what you choose if it amuses you happy and my happiness can be no greater and no less because of anything you do he thought when he told kitty of stepan advice that they should go abroad he was much surprised that she did not agree to this and had some definite requirements of her own in regard to their future she knew levin had work he loved in the country she did not as he saw understand this work she did not even care to understand it but that did not prevent her from regarding it as a matter of great importance and therefore she knew their home would be in the country and she wanted to go not abroad where she was not going to live but to the place where their home would be this definitely expressed purpose astonished levin but since he did not care either way he immediately asked stepan arkadyevich as though it were his duty to go down to the country and to arrange everything there to the best of his ability with that taste of which he had so much 
 but i say stepan arkadyevich said to him one day after he had come back from the country where he had got everything ready for the young arrival have you a certificate of having been at confession 
 no but what of it 
 you be married without it 
 my my my cried levin why i believe nine years since taken the sacrament i never thought of it 
 a pretty fellow said stepan arkadyevich laughing and you call me a nihilist but this do you know you must take the sacrament 
 when there are four days left now 
 stepan arkadyevich arranged this also and levin had to prepare himself for the sacrament to levin as to any unbeliever who respects the beliefs of others it was exceedingly disagreeable to be present at and to take part in church ceremonies at this moment in his present softened state of feeling sensitive to everything this inevitable act of hypocrisy was not merely painful to levin it seemed to him utterly impossible now in the heyday of his highest glory his fullest flower he would have to be a liar or a blasphemer he felt incapable of being either but though he repeatedly plied stepan arkadyevich with questions as to the possibility of obtaining a certificate without actually communicating stepan arkadyevich maintained that it was out of the question 
 besides what is it to you two days and an awfully fine clever old fellow pull the tooth out for you so gently you notice it 
 standing at the first mass levin attempted to revive in himself his youthful recollections of the intense religious emotion he had passed through between the ages of sixteen and seventeen but he was at once convinced that it was utterly impossible to him he attempted to look at it all as an empty custom having no sort of meaning like the custom of paying calls but he felt that he could not do that either levin found himself like the majority of his contemporaries in the vaguest position in regard to religion believe he could not and at the same time he had no firm conviction that it was all wrong and consequently not being able to believe in the significance of what he was doing nor to regard it with indifference as an empty formality during the whole period of preparing for the sacrament he was conscious of a feeling of discomfort and shame at doing what he did not himself understand and what as an inner voice told him was therefore false and wrong 
 during the service he would first listen to the prayers trying to attach some meaning to them not discordant with his own views then feeling that he could not understand and must condemn them he tried not to listen to them but to attend to the thoughts observations and memories which floated through his brain with extreme vividness during this idle time of standing in church 
 he had stood through the mass the evening service and the midnight service and the next day he got up earlier than usual and without having tea went at eight in the morning to the church for the morning service and the confession 
 there was no one in church but a beggar soldier two old women and the churchmen a young deacon whose long back showed in two distinct halves through his thin undercassock met him and at once going to a little table at the wall read the exhortations during the reading especially at the frequent and rapid repetition of the same words lord have mercy on us which sounded like mercynuslor levin felt that his thought was shut and sealed up and that it must not be touched or stirred now or else confusion would be the result and so standing behind the deacon he went on thinking of his own affairs neither listening nor examining what was said wonderful what expression there is in her hand he thought remembering how they had been sitting the day before at a corner table they had nothing to talk about as was almost always the case at this time and laying her hand on the table she kept opening and shutting it and laughed herself as she watched her action he remembered how he had kissed her hand and then had examined the lines on the pink palm another mercynuslor thought levin crossing himself bowing and looking at the supple spring of the back bowing before him she took my hand then and examined the lines got a splendid hand she said and he looked at his own hand and the short hand of the deacon yes now it will soon be over he thought no it seems to be starting up again he thought listening to the prayers no just ending there he is bowing down to the ground always at the end 
 the hand in a plush cuff unobtrusively accepted a note and the deacon said he would put name down in the register and his new boots creaking jauntily over the flagstones of the empty church he went to the altar a moment later he peeped out thence and beckoned to levin thought till then locked up began to stir in head but he made haste to drive it away it will come right somehow he thought and went toward the ambo he went up the steps and turning to the right saw the priest the priest a little ancient with a scanty grizzled beard and weary eyes was standing at the lectern turning over the pages of a missal with a slight bow to levin he began immediately reading prayers in an accustomed voice when he had finished them he bowed down to the ground and turned facing levin 
 christ is present here unseen receiving your confession he said pointing to the crucifix do you believe in all the doctrines of the holy apostolic church the priest went on turning his eyes away from face and folding his hands under his stole 
 i have doubted i doubt everything said levin in a voice that jarred on himself and he ceased speaking 
 the priest waited a few seconds to see if he would not say more and closing his eyes he said quickly with a broad vladimirsky accent 
 doubt is natural to the weakness of mankind but we must pray that god in his mercy will strengthen us what are your special sins he added without the slightest interval as though anxious not to waste time 
 my chief sin is doubt i have doubts of everything and for the most part i am in doubt 
 doubt is natural to the weakness of mankind the priest repeated the same words what do you doubt about principally 
 i doubt everything i sometimes even have doubts of the existence of god levin could not help saying and he was horrified at the impropriety of what he was saying but words did not it seemed make much impression on the priest 
 what sort of doubt can there be of the existence of god he said hurriedly with a barely perceptible smile 
 levin did not speak 
 what doubt can you have of the creator when you behold his creation the priest went on in the rapid customary recitative who has decked the heavenly firmament with its lights who has clothed the earth in its beauty how explain it without the creator he said looking inquiringly at levin 
 levin felt that it would be improper to enter upon a metaphysical discussion with the priest and so he said in reply merely what was a direct answer to the question 
 i know he said 
 you know then how can you doubt that god created all the priest said with perplexity 
 i understand it at all said levin blushing and feeling that his words were stupid and that they could not be anything but stupid in such a position 
 pray to god and beseech him even the holy fathers had doubts and prayed to god to strengthen their faith the devil has great power and we must resist him pray to god beseech him pray to god he repeated hurriedly 
 the priest paused for some time as though meditating 
 you i hear are about to marry the daughter of my parishioner and son in the spirit prince shcherbatsky he resumed with a smile an excellent young lady 
 yes answered levin blushing for the priest what does he want to ask me about this at confession for he thought 
 and as though answering his thought the priest said to him 
 you are about to enter into holy matrimony and god may bless you with offspring are you well what sort of can you give your babes if you do not overcome the temptation of the devil enticing you to infidelity he said with gentle reproachfulness if you love your child as a good father you will not desire only wealth luxury honor for your infant you will be anxious for his salvation his spiritual enlightenment with the light of truth eh what answer will you make him when the innocent babe asks you papa who made all that enchants me in this world the earth the waters the sun the flowers the grass can you say to him i know you cannot but know since the lord god in his infinite mercy has revealed it to us or your child will ask you what awaits me in the life beyond the grave what will you say to him when you know nothing how will you answer him will you leave him to the allurements of the world and the devil not right he said and he stopped putting his head on one side and looking at levin with his kindly gentle eyes 
 levin made no answer this time not because he did not want to enter upon a discussion with the priest but because no one had ever asked him such questions and when his babes did ask him those questions it would be time enough to think about answering them 
 you are entering upon a time of life pursued the priest when you must choose your path and keep to it pray to god that he may in his mercy aid you and have mercy on you he concluded our lord and god jesus christ in the abundance and riches of his forgives this child and finishing the prayer of absolution the priest blessed him and dismissed him 
 on getting home that day levin had a delightful sense of relief at the awkward position being over and having been got through without his having to tell a lie apart from this there remained a vague memory that what the kind fine old fellow had said had not been at all as stupid as he had fancied at first and that there was something in it that must be cleared up 
 of course not now thought levin but at some later day levin felt more than ever now that there was something not clear and not clean in his soul and that in regard to religion he was in the same position which he perceived so clearly and disliked in others and for which he blamed his friend sviiazhsky 
 levin spent that evening with his betrothed at and was in very high spirits to explain to stepan arkadyevich the state of excitement in which he found himself he said that he was happy like a dog being trained to jump through a hoop who having at last caught the idea and done what was required of him whines and wags its tail and jumps up to the table and the window sills in its delight

 princess shcherbatskaia considered that it was out of the question for the wedding to take place before lent just five weeks off since not half the trousseau could possibly be ready by that time but she could not but agree with levin that to fix it for after lent would be putting it off too late as an old aunt of prince was seriously ill and might die and then the mourning would delay the wedding still longer and therefore deciding to divide the trousseau into two parts a larger and a smaller trousseau the princess consented to have the wedding before lent she determined that she would get the smaller part of the trousseau all ready now and the larger part should be sent on later and she was much vexed with levin because he was incapable of giving her a serious answer to the question whether he agreed to this arrangement or not the arrangement was the more suitable as immediately after the wedding the newly married couple were to go to the country where the belongings of the larger trousseau would not be wanted 
 levin still continued in the same delirious condition in which it seemed to him that he and his happiness constituted the chief and sole aim of all existence and that he need not now think or care about anything that everything was being done and would be done for him by others he had not even plans and aims for the future he left its arrangement to others knowing that everything would be delightful his brother sergei ivanovich and stepan arkadyevich and the princess guided him in doing what he had to do all he did was to agree entirely with everything suggested to him his brother raised money for him the princess advised him to leave moscow after the wedding stepan arkadyevich advised him to go abroad he agreed to everything do what you choose if it amuses you happy and my happiness can be no greater and no less because of anything you do he thought when he told kitty of stepan advice that they should go abroad he was much surprised that she did not agree to this and had some definite requirements of her own in regard to their future she knew levin had work he loved in the country she did not as he saw understand this work she did not even care to understand it but that did not prevent her from regarding it as a matter of great importance and therefore she knew their home would be in the country and she wanted to go not abroad where she was not going to live but to the place where their home would be this definitely expressed purpose astonished levin but since he did not care either way he immediately asked stepan arkadyevich as though it were his duty to go down to the country and to arrange everything there to the best of his ability with that taste of which he had so much 
 but i say stepan arkadyevich said to him one day after he had come back from the country where he had got everything ready for the young arrival have you a certificate of having been at confession 
 no but what of it 
 you be married without it 
 my my my cried levin why i believe nine years since taken the sacrament i never thought of it 
 a pretty fellow said stepan arkadyevich laughing and you call me a nihilist but this do you know you must take the sacrament 
 when there are four days left now 
 stepan arkadyevich arranged this also and levin had to prepare himself for the sacrament to levin as to any unbeliever who respects the beliefs of others it was exceedingly disagreeable to be present at and to take part in church ceremonies at this moment in his present softened state of feeling sensitive to everything this inevitable act of hypocrisy was not merely painful to levin it seemed to him utterly impossible now in the heyday of his highest glory his fullest flower he would have to be a liar or a blasphemer he felt incapable of being either but though he repeatedly plied stepan arkadyevich with questions as to the possibility of obtaining a certificate without actually communicating stepan arkadyevich maintained that it was out of the question 
 besides what is it to you two days and an awfully fine clever old fellow pull the tooth out for you so gently you notice it 
 standing at the first mass levin attempted to revive in himself his youthful recollections of the intense religious emotion he had passed through between the ages of sixteen and seventeen but he was at once convinced that it was utterly impossible to him he attempted to look at it all as an empty custom having no sort of meaning like the custom of paying calls but he felt that he could not do that either levin found himself like the majority of his contemporaries in the vaguest position in regard to religion believe he could not and at the same time he had no firm conviction that it was all wrong and consequently not being able to believe in the significance of what he was doing nor to regard it with indifference as an empty formality during the whole period of preparing for the sacrament he was conscious of a feeling of discomfort and shame at doing what he did not himself understand and what as an inner voice told him was therefore false and wrong 
 during the service he would first listen to the prayers trying to attach some meaning to them not discordant with his own views then feeling that he could not understand and must condemn them he tried not to listen to them but to attend to the thoughts observations and memories which floated through his brain with extreme vividness during this idle time of standing in church 
 he had stood through the mass the evening service and the midnight service and the next day he got up earlier than usual and without having tea went at eight in the morning to the church for the morning service and the confession 
 there was no one in church but a beggar soldier two old women and the churchmen a young deacon whose long back showed in two distinct halves through his thin undercassock met him and at once going to a little table at the wall read the exhortations during the reading especially at the frequent and rapid repetition of the same words lord have mercy on us which sounded like mercynuslor levin felt that his thought was shut and sealed up and that it must not be touched or stirred now or else confusion would be the result and so standing behind the deacon he went on thinking of his own affairs neither listening nor examining what was said wonderful what expression there is in her hand he thought remembering how they had been sitting the day before at a corner table they had nothing to talk about as was almost always the case at this time and laying her hand on the table she kept opening and shutting it and laughed herself as she watched her action he remembered how he had kissed her hand and then had examined the lines on the pink palm another mercynuslor thought levin crossing himself bowing and looking at the supple spring of the back bowing before him she took my hand then and examined the lines got a splendid hand she said and he looked at his own hand and the short hand of the deacon yes now it will soon be over he thought no it seems to be starting up again he thought listening to the prayers no just ending there he is bowing down to the ground always at the end 
 the hand in a plush cuff unobtrusively accepted a note and the deacon said he would put name down in the register and his new boots creaking jauntily over the flagstones of the empty church he went to the altar a moment later he peeped out thence and beckoned to levin thought till then locked up began to stir in head but he made haste to drive it away it will come right somehow he thought and went toward the ambo he went up the steps and turning to the right saw the priest the priest a little ancient with a scanty grizzled beard and weary eyes was standing at the lectern turning over the pages of a missal with a slight bow to levin he began immediately reading prayers in an accustomed voice when he had finished them he bowed down to the ground and turned facing levin 
 christ is present here unseen receiving your confession he said pointing to the crucifix do you believe in all the doctrines of the holy apostolic church the priest went on turning his eyes away from face and folding his hands under his stole 
 i have doubted i doubt everything said levin in a voice that jarred on himself and he ceased speaking 
 the priest waited a few seconds to see if he would not say more and closing his eyes he said quickly with a broad vladimirsky accent 
 doubt is natural to the weakness of mankind but we must pray that god in his mercy will strengthen us what are your special sins he added without the slightest interval as though anxious not to waste time 
 my chief sin is doubt i have doubts of everything and for the most part i am in doubt 
 doubt is natural to the weakness of mankind the priest repeated the same words what do you doubt about principally 
 i doubt everything i sometimes even have doubts of the existence of god levin could not help saying and he was horrified at the impropriety of what he was saying but words did not it seemed make much impression on the priest 
 what sort of doubt can there be of the existence of god he said hurriedly with a barely perceptible smile 
 levin did not speak 
 what doubt can you have of the creator when you behold his creation the priest went on in the rapid customary recitative who has decked the heavenly firmament with its lights who has clothed the earth in its beauty how explain it without the creator he said looking inquiringly at levin 
 levin felt that it would be improper to enter upon a metaphysical discussion with the priest and so he said in reply merely what was a direct answer to the question 
 i know he said 
 you know then how can you doubt that god created all the priest said with perplexity 
 i understand it at all said levin blushing and feeling that his words were stupid and that they could not be anything but stupid in such a position 
 pray to god and beseech him even the holy fathers had doubts and prayed to god to strengthen their faith the devil has great power and we must resist him pray to god beseech him pray to god he repeated hurriedly

 how happy i shall be when i hear that in love said levin please invite me to the wedding

 levin smiled the picture of his wife not letting him go was so pleasant that he was ready to renounce forever the delights of looking upon bears 
 still a pity they should get those two bears without you do you remember last time at khapilovo and now it would be a delightful hunt said chirikov 
 levin had not the heart to disillusion him of the notion that there could be something delightful apart from her and so said nothing 
 some sense in this custom of saying to bachelor life said sergei ivanovich however happy you may be you must regret your freedom 
 and confess there is a feeling that you want to jump out of the window like bridegroom 
 of course there is but he confess said katavassov and he broke into loud laughter 
 oh well the open start off this instant to tver a big one can go right up to the lair seriously go by the five and here let them do what they like said chirikov smiling

 awful a hopeless case said katavassov well drink to his recovery or wish that a hundredth part of his dreams may be realized and that would be happiness such as never has been seen on earth 
 soon after dinner the guests went away to dress in time for the wedding 
 when he was left alone and recalled the conversation of these bachelor friends levin asked himself had he in his heart that regret for his freedom of which they had spoken he smiled at the question freedom what is freedom for happiness is only in loving and wishing her wishes thinking her thoughts that is to say not freedom at all happiness 
 but do i know her thoughts her wishes her feelings some voice suddenly whispered to him the smile died away from his face and he grew thoughtful and suddenly a strange feeling came upon him there came over him a dread and doubt doubt of everything 
 what if she does not love me what if marrying me simply to be married what if she see herself what doing he asked himself she may come to her senses and only when she is being married realize that she does not and cannot love me and strange most evil thoughts of her began to come to him he was jealous of vronsky as he had been a year ago as though the evening he had seen her with vronsky had been yesterday he suspected she had not told him everything 
 he jumped up quickly no this go on he said to himself in despair go to her ask her say for the last time we are free and we better stay so better than endless misery disgrace unfaithfulness with despair in his heart and bitter anger against all men against himself against her he went out of the hotel and drove to her house 
 he found her in one of the rear rooms she was sitting on a chest and making some arrangements with her maid sorting over heaps of dresses of different colors spread on the backs of chairs and on the floor 
 ah she cried seeing him and beaming with delight kostia konstantin dmitrievich these latter days she used these names almost alternately i expect you going through my girlish wardrobe to see for whom 
 oh very lovely he said gloomily looking at the maid 
 you can go duniasha call you presently said kitty kostia the matter she asked definitely adopting this familiar name as soon as the maid had gone out she noticed his strange face agitated and gloomy and a panic came over her 
 kitty in torture i be in torture alone he said with despair in his voice standing before her and looking imploringly into her eyes he saw already from her loving truthful face that nothing could come of what he had meant to say but yet he wanted her to reassure him herself come to say that still time this can all be stopped and set right 
 what i understand what is the matter 
 what i have said a thousand times over and help thinking that not worthy of you you consent to marry me think a little made a mistake think it over thoroughly you love me if better say so he said without looking at her i shall be wretched let people say what they like better than misery far better now while still time

 i am thinking you love me what can you love me for 
 my god what can i do she said and burst into tears 
 oh what have i done he cried and kneeling before her he fell to kissing her hands 
 when the old princess came into the room five minutes later she found them completely reconciled kitty had not simply assured him that she loved him but had gone so far in answer to his question what she loved him for as to explain what for she told him that she loved him because she understood him completely because she knew what he would like and because everything he liked was good and this seemed to him perfectly clear when the princess came to them they were sitting side by side on the chest sorting the dresses and disputing over wanting to give duniasha the brown dress she had been wearing when levin proposed to her while he insisted that that dress must never be given away but that duniasha should have the blue one 
 how is it you see a brunette and it suit her worked it all out

 a crowd of people principally women was thronging round the church lighted up for the wedding those who had not succeeded in getting into the main entrance were crowding about the windows pushing wrangling and peeping through the gratings 
 more than twenty carriages had already been drawn up in ranks along the street by the police a police officer regardless of the frost stood at the entrance gorgeous in his uniform more carriages were continually driving up and ladies wearing flowers and carrying their trains and men taking off their kepis or black hats kept walking into the church inside the church both lusters were already lighted and all the candles before the icons the golden nimbus on the red ground of the ikonostasis and the gilt relief on the icons and the silver of the lusters and candlesticks and the and the rugs and the banners above in the choir and the steps of the ambo and the old blackened books and the cassocks and surplices all were flooded with light on the right side of the warm church in the crowd of evening dresses and white ties of uniforms and of silk velvet satin hair and flowers of bare shoulders and arms and long gloves there was discreet but lively conversation that echoed strangely in the high cupola every time there was heard the creak of the opened door the conversation in the crowd died away and everybody looked round expecting to see the bride and bridegroom come in but the door had opened more than ten times and each time it was either a belated guest or guests who joined the circle of the invited on the right or some spectator who had eluded or softened the police officer and went to join the crowd of outsiders on the left both the guests and the outside public had by now passed through all the phases of anticipation 
 at first they imagined that the bride and bridegroom would arrive immediately and attached no importance at all to their being late then they began to look more and more often toward the door and to talk of whether anything could have happened then the long delay began to be positively discomforting and relations and guests tried to look as if they were not thinking of the bridegroom at all but were engrossed in conversation 
 the protodeacon as though to remind them of the value of his time coughed impatiently making the windowpanes rattle in their frames in the choir the bored choristers could be heard trying their voices and blowing their noses the priest was continually sending first the church clerk and then the deacon to find out whether the bridegroom had not come more and more often he went himself in a lilac vestment and an embroidered sash to the side door expecting to see the bridegroom at last one of the ladies glancing at her watch said it really is strange though and all the guests became uneasy and began loudly expressing their wonder and dissatisfaction one of the best men went to find out what had happened kitty meanwhile had long ago been quite ready and in her white dress and long veil and wreath of orange blossoms was standing in the drawing room of the shcherbatskys house with her sister madame lvova who was her bridal mother she was looking out of the window and had been for over half an hour anxiously expecting to hear from her best man that her bridegroom was at the church 
 levin meanwhile in his trousers but without his coat and waistcoat was walking to and fro in his room at the hotel continually putting his head out of door and looking up and down the corridor but in the corridor there was no sign of the person he was looking for and he came back in despair and waving his hands addressed stepan arkadyevich who was smoking serenely 
 was ever a man in such a fearful position he said 
 yes it is stupid stepan arkadyevich assented smiling soothingly but worry be brought directly 
 no what is to be done said levin with smothered fury and these fool open waistcoats out of the question he said looking at the crumpled front of his shirt and what if the things have been taken on to the railway station he roared in desperation 
 then you must put on mine 
 i ought to have done so long ago if at all 
 not well to look ridiculous wait a bit it will come round 
 the point was that when levin asked for his evening suit kouzma his old servant had brought him the coat waistcoat and everything that was wanted 
 but the shirt cried levin 
 got a shirt on kouzma answered with a placid smile 
 kouzma had not thought of leaving out a clean shirt and on receiving instructions to pack up everything and send it round to the shcherbatskys house from which the young people were to set out the same evening he had done so packing everything but the dress suit the shirt worn since the morning was crumpled and out of the question with the fashionable open waistcoat it was a long way to send to the shcherbatskys they sent out to buy a shirt the servant came back everything was shut up it was sunday they sent to stepan and brought a shirt it was impossibly wide and short they sent finally to the shcherbatskys to unpack the things the bridegroom was expected at the church while he was pacing up and down his room like a wild beast in a cage peeping out into the corridor and with horror and despair recalling what absurd things he had said to kitty and what she might be thinking now 
 at last the guilty kouzma flew panting into the room with the shirt 
 only just in time they were just lifting it into the van said kouzma 
 three minutes later levin ran full speed into the corridor without looking at his watch for fear of aggravating his sufferings 
 you help matters like that said stepan arkadyevich with a smile hurrying with more deliberation after him it will come round it will come round i tell you

 chapter 
 
 come here he is which one rather young eh why my dear soul she looks more dead than alive were the comments in the crowd when levin meeting his bride in the entrance walked with her into the church 
 stepan arkadyevich told his wife the cause of the delay and the guests were whispering it with smiles to one another levin saw nothing and no one he did not take his eyes off his bride 
 everyone said she had lost her looks dreadfully of late and was not nearly as pretty on her wedding day as usual but levin did not think so he looked at her hair done up high with the long white veil and white flowers and the high scalloped de medici collar that in such a maidenly fashion hid her long neck at the sides and only showed it in front and her strikingly slender figure and it seemed to him that she looked better than ever not because these flowers this veil this gown from paris added anything to her beauty but because in spite of the elaborate sumptuousness of her attire the expression of her sweet face of her eyes of her lips was still her own characteristic expression of guileless truthfulness 
 i was beginning to think you meant to run away she said and smiled to him 
 what happened to me is so stupid ashamed to speak of it he said reddening and he was obliged to turn to sergei ivanovich who came up to him 
 this is a pretty story of yours about the shirt said sergei ivanovich shaking his head and smiling 
 yes yes answered levin without an idea of what they were talking about 
 now kostia you have to decide said stepan arkadyevich with an air of mock dismay a weighty question you are at this moment just in the humor to appreciate all its gravity they ask me are they to light the candles that have been lighted before or candles that have never been lighted a matter of ten roubles he added relaxing his lips into a smile i have decided but i was afraid you might not agree 
 levin saw it was a joke but he could not smile 
 well it to be then unused or used candles that is the question 
 yes yes unused ones 
 oh very glad the decided said stepan arkadyevich smiling how silly men become though in this situation he said to chirikov when levin after looking absently at him had moved back to his bride 
 kitty mind the first to step on the carpet said countess nordstone coming up a fine person she said to levin 
 you frightened eh said marya dmitrievna an old aunt 
 are you cold pale stop a minute stoop down said sister madame lvova and with her plump pretty hands she smilingly set straight the flowers on her head 
 dolly came up tried to say something but could not speak cried and then laughed naturally 
 kitty looked at all of them with the same absent eyes as levin 
 meanwhile the officiating clergy had got into their vestments and the priest and deacon came out to the lectern which stood in the porch of the church the priest turned to levin saying something levin did not hear what the priest said 
 take the hand and lead her up the best man said to levin 
 it was a long while before levin could make out what was expected of him for a long time they tried to set him right and made him begin again because he kept taking kitty by the wrong arm or with the wrong arm till he understood at last that what he had to do was without changing his position to take her right hand in his right hand when at last he had taken the hand in the correct way the priest walked a few paces in front of them and stopped at the lectern the crowd of friends and relations moved after them with a buzz of talk and a rustle of trains someone stooped down and straightened out the train the church became so still that the drops of wax could be heard falling from the candles 
 the little old priest in his calotte with his long locks of hair parted behind his ears was fumbling with something at the lectern putting out his little old hands from under the heavy silver vestment with the gold cross on the back of it 
 stepan arkadyevich approached him cautiously whispered something and giving a wink at levin walked back again 
 the priest lighted two candles wreathed with flowers and holding them sideways so that the wax dropped slowly from them he turned facing the bridal pair the priest was the same old man who had confessed levin he looked with weary and melancholy eyes at the bride and bridegroom sighed and putting his right hand out from under his vestment blessed the bridegroom with it and also with a shade of solicitous tenderness laid his crossed fingers on the bowed head of kitty then he gave them the candles and taking the censer moved slowly away from them 
 can it be true thought levin and he looked round at his bride looking down at her he saw her face in profile and from the scarcely perceptible quiver of her lips and eyelashes he knew she was aware of his eyes upon her she did not look round but the high scalloped collar that reached her little pink ear trembled faintly he saw that a sigh was held back in her throat and the little hand in the long glove shook as it held the candle 
 all the fuss of the shirt of being late all the talk of friends and relations their annoyance his ludicrous position all suddenly passed away and he was filled with joy and dread 
 the handsome stately protodeacon wearing a silver robe and his curly locks standing out at each side of his head stepped smartly forward and lifting his stole on two fingers stood opposite the priest 
 blessed be the name of the lord the solemn syllables rang out slowly one after another setting the air quivering with waves of sound 
 blessed is the name of our god from the beginning as now and forever and aye the little old priest answered in a submissive piping voice still fingering something at the lectern and the full chorus of the unseen choir rose up filling the whole church from the windows to the vaulted roof with broad waves of melody it grew stronger rested for an instant and slowly died away 
 they prayed as they always do for peace from on high and for salvation for the holy synod and for the czar they prayed too for the servants of god konstantin and ekaterina now plighting their troth 
 vouchsafe to them love made perfect peace and help o lord we beseech thee the whole church seemed to breathe with the voice of the protodeacon 
 levin heard the words and they impressed him how did they guess that it is help just help that one wants he thought recalling all his fears and doubts of late what do i know what can i do in this fearful business he thought without help yes it is help i want now 
 when the deacon had finished the liturgical prayer the priest turned to the bridal pair with his book eternal god who joinest together in love them that were separate he read in a gentle piping voice who hast ordained the union of holy wedlock that cannot be set asunder thou who didst bless isaac and rebecca and their descendants according to thy holy covenant bless thou thy servants konstantin and ekaterina leading them in the path of all good works for gracious and merciful art thou our lord and glory be to thee the father the son and the holy ghost now and forever and aye amen the unseen choir sent rolling again through the air 
 joinest together in love them that were separate what deep meaning in those words and how they correspond with what one feels at this moment thought levin is she feeling the same as i 
 and looking round he met her eyes and from their expression he concluded that she was understanding it just as he was but this was a mistake she almost completely missed the meaning of the words of the service she had not heard them in fact she could not listen to them and take them in so strong was the one feeling that filled her breast and grew stronger and stronger that feeling was joy at the completion of the process that for the last month and a half had been going on in her soul and had during those six weeks been a joy and a torture to her on the day when in the drawing room of the house in the arbat street she had gone up to him in her brown dress and had given herself to him without a word on that day at that hour there took place in her heart a complete severance from all her old life and a quite different new utterly strange life had begun for her while the old life was actually going on as before those six weeks had for her been a time of the utmost bliss and the utmost misery all her life all her desires and hopes were concentrated on this one man still uncomprehended by her to whom she was bound by a feeling of alternate attraction and repulsion even less comprehended than the man himself and all the while she was going on living in the outward conditions of her old life living the old life she was horrified at herself at her utter insurmountable callousness to all her own past to things to habits to the people she had loved who loved her to her mother who was wounded by her indifference to her kind tender father till then dearer than all the world at one moment she was horrified at this indifference at another she rejoiced at what had brought her to this indifference she could not frame a thought nor a wish apart from life with this man but this new life was not yet and she could not even picture it clearly to herself there was only anticipation the dread and joy of the new and the unknown and now behold anticipation and uncertainty and remorse at the abandonment of the old life all this was ending and the new was beginning this new life could not but have terrors for her by its obscurity but terrible or not the change had been wrought six weeks before in her soul and this was merely the final sanction of what had long been completed in her heart 
 turning again to the lectern the priest with some difficulty took little ring and asking levin for his hand put it on the first joint of his finger the servant of god konstantin plights his troth to the servant of god ekaterina and putting his big ring on touchingly weak pink tiny finger the priest said the same thing 
 and the bridal pair tried several times to understand what they had to do and each time made some mistake and were corrected by the priest in a whisper at last having duly performed the ceremony having made with the rings the sign of the cross over them the priest handed kitty the big ring and levin the little one again they were puzzled and passed the rings from hand to hand still without doing what was expected 
 dolly chirikov and stepan arkadyevich stepped forward to set them right there was an interval of hesitation whispering and smiles but the expression of solemn emotion on the faces of the betrothed pair did not change on the contrary in their perplexity over their hands they looked more grave and deeply moved than before and the smile with which stepan arkadyevich whispered to them that now they would each put on their own ring died away on his lips he had a feeling that any smile would jar on them 
 thou who didst from the beginning create male and female the priest read after the exchange of rings from thee woman was given to man to be a helpmeet to him and for the procreation of children o lord our god who hast poured down the blessings of thy truth according to thy holy covenant upon thy chosen servants our fathers from generation to generation bless thy servants konstantin and ekaterina and make their troth fast in faith and union of hearts and in truth and in love 
 levin felt more and more that all his ideas of marriage all his dreams of how he would order his life were mere childishness and that it was something he had not understood hitherto and now understood less than ever though it was being performed upon him the lump in his throat rose higher and higher tears that would not be checked came into his eyes

 chapter 
 
 in the church there was all moscow all the friends and relations and during the ceremony of plighting troth in the brilliantly lighted church there was an incessant flow of discreetly subdued talk in the circle of gaily dressed women and girls and men in white ties evening dress and uniform the talk was principally kept up by the men while the women were absorbed in watching every detail of the ceremony which always touches them so much 
 in the little group nearest the bride were her two sisters dolly and the younger one the beauty madame lvova who had just arrived from abroad 
 why is it in lilac as bad as black at a wedding said madame korsunskaia 
 with her complexion her one salvation responded madame drubetskaia i wonder why they had the wedding in the evening like shop people 
 so much prettier i was married in the evening too answered madame korsunskaia and she sighed remembering how charming she had been that day and how absurdly in love her husband was and how different it all was now 
 they say if anyone is best man more than ten times never be married i wanted to be one for the tenth time but the post was taken said count siniavin to the pretty princess charskaia who had designs on him 
 princess charskaia only answered with a smile she looked at kitty thinking how and when she would stand with count siniavin in place and how she would remind him then of his joke today 
 shcherbatsky told the old hoffraulein madame nikoleva that he meant to put the crown on chignon for luck 
 she ought not to have worn a chignon answered madame nikoleva who had long ago made up her mind that if the elderly widower she was angling for married her the wedding should be of the simplest i like such faste 
 sergei ivanovich was talking to darya dmitrievna jestingly assuring her that the custom of going away after the wedding was becoming common because newly married people always felt a little ashamed of themselves 
 your brother may feel proud of himself a marvel of sweetness i believe envious 
 oh got over that darya dmitrievna he answered and a melancholy and serious expression suddenly came over his face 
 stepan arkadyevich was telling his his joke about divorce 
 the wreath wants setting straight she answered without listening to him 
 what a pity lost her looks so countess nordstone said to madame lvova still not worth her little finger is he 
 oh i like him so not because my future answered madame lvova and how well behaving so difficult too to look well in such a position not to be ridiculous and not ridiculous and not affected one can see moved 
 you expected it i suppose 
 almost she always cared for him 
 well we shall see which of them will step on the rug first i warned kitty

 in the church there was all moscow all the friends and relations and during the ceremony of plighting troth in the brilliantly lighted church there was an incessant flow of discreetly subdued talk in the circle of gaily dressed women and girls and men in white ties evening dress and uniform the talk was principally kept up by the men while the women were absorbed in watching every detail of the ceremony which always touches them so much 
 in the little group nearest the bride were her two sisters dolly and the younger one the beauty madame lvova who had just arrived from abroad 
 why is it in lilac as bad as black at a wedding said madame korsunskaia 
 with her complexion her one salvation responded madame drubetskaia i wonder why they had the wedding in the evening like shop people 
 so much prettier i was married in the evening too answered madame korsunskaia and she sighed remembering how charming she had been that day and how absurdly in love her husband was and how different it all was now 
 they say if anyone is best man more than ten times never be married i wanted to be one for the tenth time but the post was taken said count siniavin to the pretty princess charskaia who had designs on him 
 princess charskaia only answered with a smile she looked at kitty thinking how and when she would stand with count siniavin in place and how she would remind him then of his joke today 
 shcherbatsky told the old hoffraulein madame nikoleva that he meant to put the crown on chignon for luck 
 she ought not to have worn a chignon answered madame nikoleva who had long ago made up her mind that if the elderly widower she was angling for married her the wedding should be of the simplest i like such faste 
 sergei ivanovich was talking to darya dmitrievna jestingly assuring her that the custom of going away after the wedding was becoming common because newly married people always felt a little ashamed of themselves 
 your brother may feel proud of himself a marvel of sweetness i believe envious 
 oh got over that darya dmitrievna he answered and a melancholy and serious expression suddenly came over his face 
 stepan arkadyevich was telling his his joke about divorce 
 the wreath wants setting straight she answered without listening to him 
 what a pity lost her looks so countess nordstone said to madame lvova still not worth her little finger is he 
 oh i like him so not because my future answered madame lvova and how well behaving so difficult too to look well in such a position not to be ridiculous and not ridiculous and not affected one can see moved 
 you expected it i suppose 
 almost she always cared for him 
 well we shall see which of them will step on the rug first i warned kitty 
 it will make no difference said madame lvova all obedient wives in our family 
 oh i stepped on the rug before vassilii on purpose and you dolly 
 dolly stood beside them she heard them but she did not answer she was deeply moved the tears stood in her eyes and she could not have spoken without crying she was rejoicing over kitty and levin going back in thought to her own wedding she glanced at the radiant figure of stepan arkadyevich forgot all the present and remembered only her own innocent love she recalled not herself only but all her women friends and acquaintances she thought of them on the one day of their triumph when they had stood like kitty under the wedding crown with love and hope and dread in their hearts renouncing the past and stepping forward into the mysterious future among the brides that came back to her memory she thought too of her darling anna of whose proposed divorce she had just been hearing and she had stood just as innocent in orange blossoms and bridal veil and now terribly strange she said to herself

 when the ceremony of plighting troth was over the sacristan spread before the lectern in the middle of the church a piece of pink silken stuff the choir sang a complicated and elaborate psalm in which the bass and tenor sang responses to one another and the priest turning round pointed the bridal pair to the pink silk rug though both had often heard a great deal about the saying that the one who steps first on the rug will be the head of the house neither levin nor kitty were capable of recollecting it as they took the few steps toward it they did not hear the loud remarks and disputes that followed some maintaining he had stepped on it first and others that both had stepped on it together 
 after the customary questions whether they desired to enter upon matrimony and whether they were pledged to anyone else and their answers which sounded strange to themselves a new ceremony began kitty listened to the words of the prayer trying to make out their meaning but she could not the feeling of triumph and radiant happiness flooded her soul more and more as the ceremony went on and deprived her of all power of attention 
 they prayed endow them with continence and fruitfulness and vouchsafe that their hearts may rejoice looking upon their sons and daughters they alluded to creation of a wife from rib and for this cause a man shall leave father and mother and cleave unto his wife and they two shall be one flesh and that this is a great mystery they prayed that god would make them fruitful and bless them like isaac and rebecca joseph moses and zipporah and that they might look upon their children all splendid thought kitty catching the words all just as it should be and a smile of happiness unconsciously reflected in everyone who looked at her beamed on her radiant face 
 put it on completely voices were heard urging when after the priest had put on their wedding crowns and shcherbatsky his hand shaking in its glove was holding the crown high above her head 
 put it on she whispered smiling 
 levin looked round at her and was struck by the joyful radiance on her face and unconsciously her feeling infected him he too like her felt joyous and happy 
 they enjoyed hearing the epistle read and the roll of the voice at the last verse awaited with such impatience by the outside public they enjoyed drinking out of the shallow cup of warm red wine and water and they were still more pleased when the priest flinging back his stole and taking both their hands in his led them round the lectern to the accompaniment of bass voices chanting isaiah rejoice shcherbatsky and chirikov supporting the crowns and stumbling over the train smiling too and seeming delighted at something were at one moment left behind at the next treading on the bridal pair as the priest came to a halt the spark of joy kindled in kitty seemed to have infected everyone in the church it seemed to levin that the priest and the deacon too wanted to smile just as he did 
 taking the crowns off their heads the priest read the last prayer and congratulated the young couple levin looked at kitty and he had never before seen her look as she did she was charming with the new radiance of happiness in her face levin longed to say something to her but he did not know whether it was all over the priest got him out of his difficulty he smiled his kindly smile and said gently kiss your wife and you kiss your husband and took the candles out of their hands 
 levin kissed her smiling lips with timid care gave her his arm and with a new strange sense of closeness walked out of the church he did not believe he could not believe that it was true it was only when their wondering and timid eyes met that he believed in it because he felt that they were one

 chapter 
 
 vronsky and anna had been traveling for three months together in europe they had visited venice rome and naples and had just arrived at a small italian town where they meant to stay some time 
 a handsome headwaiter with thick pomaded hair parted from the neck upward wearing an evening coat a broad white cambric shirt front and a bunch of watch charms dangling above his small bay window stood with his hands in his pockets looking contemptuously from under his eyelids while he gave some frigid reply to a gentleman who had stopped still catching the sound of footsteps coming from the other side of the entry toward the staircase the headwaiter turned round and seeing the russian count who had taken their best rooms he took his hands out of his pockets deferentially and with a bow informed him that a courier had come and that the business about the palazzo had been arranged the steward was prepared to sign the agreement 
 ah glad to hear it said vronsky is madame at home or not 
 madame has been out for a walk but has returned now answered the waiter 
 vronsky took off his soft hat and passed his handkerchief over his heated brow and hair which had grown half over his ears and was brushed back covering the bald patch on his head and glancing casually at the gentleman who still stood there gazing intently at him he would have gone on 
 this gentleman is a russian and was inquiring after you said the headwaiter 
 with mingled feelings of annoyance at never being able to get away from acquaintances anywhere and longing to find some sort of diversion from the monotony of his life vronsky looked once more at the gentleman who had retreated and stood still again and at the same moment a light came into the eyes of both 
 golenishchev 
 vronsky 
 it really was golenishchev a comrade of in the corps of pages in the corps golenishchev had belonged to the liberal party he left the corps without entering the army and had never taken office under the government vronsky and he had gone completely different ways on leaving the corps and had only met once since 
 at that meeting vronsky perceived that golenishchev had taken up a sort of lofty intellectually liberal line and was consequently disposed to look down upon interests and calling in life hence vronsky had met him with the chilling and haughty manner he so well knew how to assume the meaning of which was you may like or dislike my ways of life a matter of the most perfect indifference to me you will have to treat me with respect if you want to know me golenishchev had been contemptuously indifferent to the tone taken by vronsky that meeting might have been expected to estrange them still more but now they beamed and exclaimed with delight on recognizing one another vronsky would never have expected to be so pleased to see golenishchev but probably he was not himself aware how bored he was he forgot the disagreeable impression of their last meeting and with a face of frank delight held out his hand to his old comrade the same expression of delight replaced the look of uneasiness on face 
 how glad i am to meet you said vronsky showing his strong white teeth in a friendly smile 
 i heard the name vronsky but i know which one very very glad 
 go in come tell me what doing 
 been living here for two years working 
 ah said vronsky with sympathy go in 
 and with the habit common among russians instead of saying in russian what he wanted to keep from the servants he began to speak in french 
 do you know madame karenina we are traveling together i am going to see her now he said in french carefully scrutinizing face 
 ah i did not know though he did know golenishchev answered carelessly have you been here long he added 
 three days vronsky answered once more scrutinizing his face intently 
 yes a decent fellow and will look at the thing properly vronsky said to himself catching the significance of face and the change of subject i can introduce him to anna he looks at it properly 
 during the three months that vronsky had spent abroad with anna he had always on meeting new people asked himself how the new person would look at his relations with anna and for the most part in men he had met with the proper way of looking at it but if he had been asked and those who looked at it properly had been asked exactly how they did look at it both he and they would have been greatly puzzled to answer 
 in reality those who in opinion had the proper view had no sort of view at all but behaved in general as persons do behave in regard to all the complex and insoluble problems with which life is encompassed on all sides they behaved with propriety avoiding allusions and unpleasant questions they assumed an air of fully comprehending the import and force of the situation of accepting and even approving of it but of considering it superfluous and to put all this into words 
 vronsky at once divined that golenishchev was of this class and therefore was doubly pleased to see him and in fact manner to madame karenina when he was taken to call on her was all that vronsky could have desired obviously without the slightest effort he steered clear of all subjects which might lead to embarrassment 
 he had never met anna before and was struck by her beauty and still more by the naturalness with which she accepted her position she blushed when vronsky brought in golenishchev and he was extremely charmed by this childish blush overspreading her candid and handsome face but what he liked particularly was the way in which at once as though on purpose so that there might be no misunderstanding with an outsider she called vronsky simply alexei and said they were moving into a house they had just taken what was here called a palazzo golenishchev liked this direct and simple attitude to her own position looking at manner of simplehearted spirited gaiety and knowing alexei alexandrovich and vronsky golenishchev fancied that he understood her perfectly he fancied that he understood what she was utterly unable to understand how it was that having made her husband wretched having abandoned him and her son and lost her good name she yet felt full of spirits gaiety and happiness 
 in the guidebook said golenishchev referring to the palazzo vronsky had taken a tintoretto there one of his latest period 
 i tell you what a lovely day go and have another look at it said vronsky addressing anna 
 i shall be very glad to go and put on my hat would you say hot she said stopping short in the doorway and looking inquiringly at vronsky and again a vivid flush overspread her face 
 vronsky saw from her eyes that she did not know on what terms he cared to be with golenishchev and so was afraid of not behaving as he would wish 
 he bestowed a long tender look at her 
 no not very he said 
 and it seemed to her that she understood everything most of all that he was pleased with her and smiling to him she walked with her rapid step out of the door 
 the friends glanced at one another and a look of hesitation came into both faces as though golenishchev unmistakably admiring her would have liked to say something about her and could not find the right thing to say while vronsky desired and dreaded his doing so 
 well then vronsky began to start a conversation of some sort so settled here still at the same work then he went on recalling that he had been told golenishchev was writing something 
 yes writing the second part of the two elements said golenishchev coloring with pleasure at the question that is to be exact i am not writing it yet i am preparing collecting materials it will be of far wider scope and will touch on almost all questions we in russia refuse to see that we are the heirs of byzantium and he launched into a long and heated explanation of his views 
 vronsky at the first moment felt embarrassed at not even knowing of the first part of the two elements of which the author spoke as something well known but as golenishchev began to lay down his opinions and vronsky was able to follow them even without knowing the two elements he listened to him with some interest for golenishchev spoke well but vronsky was startled and annoyed by the nervous irascibility with which golenishchev talked of the subject that engrossed him as he went on talking his eyes glittered more and more angrily he was more and more hurried in his replies to imaginary opponents and his face grew more and more excited and worried remembering golenishchev a thin lively and boy always at the head of the class vronsky could not make out the reason for his irritability and he did not like it what he particularly disliked was that golenishchev a man belonging to a good set should put himself on a level with some scribbling fellows with whom he was irritated and angry was it worth it vronsky disliked it yet he felt that golenishchev was unhappy and was sorry for him unhappiness almost mental derangement was visible on his mobile rather handsome face as without even noticing coming in he went on hurriedly and hotly expressing his views 
 when anna came in in her hat and cape her lovely hand rapidly swinging her parasol and stood beside him it was with a feeling of relief that vronsky broke away from the plaintive eyes of golenishchev which fastened persistently upon him and with a fresh rush of love looked at his charming companion full of life and happiness golenishchev recovered himself with an effort and at first was dejected and gloomy but anna disposed as she was at that time to feel friendly with everyone soon revived his spirits by her direct and lively manner after trying various subjects of conversation she got him upon painting of which he talked very well and she listened to him attentively they walked to the house they had taken and looked over it 
 i am very glad of one thing said anna to golenishchev when they were on their way back alexei will have a capital atelier you must certainly take that room she said to vronsky in russian using the affectionately familiar form as though she saw that golenishchev would become intimate with them in their isolation and that there was no need of reserve before him 
 do you paint said golenishchev turning round quickly to vronsky 
 yes i used to study long ago and now i have begun to do a little said vronsky reddening 
 he has great talent said anna with a delighted smile no judge of course but good judges have said the same

 chapter

 vronsky meanwhile in spite of the complete realization of what he had so long desired was not perfectly happy he soon felt that the realization of his desires gave him no more than a grain of sand out of the mountain of happiness he had expected it showed him the mistake men make in picturing to themselves happiness as the realization of their desires for a time after joining his life to hers and putting on civilian dress he had felt all the delight of freedom in general of which he had known nothing before and of freedom in his love and he was content but not for long he was soon aware that there was springing up in his heart a desire for desires longing without conscious intention he began to clutch at every passing caprice taking it for a desire and an object sixteen hours of the day must be occupied in some way since they were living abroad in complete freedom outside the conditions of social life which filled up time in peterburg as for the amusements of bachelor existence which had provided vronsky with entertainment on previous tours abroad they could not be thought of since the sole attempt of the sort had led to a sudden attack of depression in anna quite out of proportion with the cause a late supper with bachelor friends relations with the society of the place foreign and russian were equally out of the question owing to the irregularity of their position the inspection of objects of interest apart from the fact that everything had been seen already had not for vronsky a russian and a sensible man the inexplicable significance englishmen are able to attach to that pursuit

 as he had ever since he was a child a taste for painting and as not knowing what to spend his money on he had begun collecting engravings he came to a stop at painting began to take interest in it and concentrated upon it the unoccupied fund of desires which demanded satisfaction 
 as he had a capacity for understanding art and for true and tasteful imitation in the art of painting he supposed himself to have the real thing essential for an artist and after hesitating for some time which style of painting to select religious historical realistic or genre painting he set to work to paint he appreciated all kinds and could have felt inspired by any one of them but he had no conception of the possibility of knowing nothing at all of any school of painting and of being inspired directly by what is within the soul without caring whether what is painted will belong to any recognized school since he knew nothing of this and drew his inspiration not directly from life but indirectly from life embodied in art his inspiration came very quickly and easily and as quickly and easily came his success in painting something very similar to the sort of painting he was trying to imitate 
 more than any other style he liked the french graceful and effective and in that style he began to paint portrait in italian costume and the portrait seemed to him and to everyone who saw it extremely successful

 the old neglected palazzo with its lofty plastic plafonds and frescoes on the walls with its floors of mosaic with its heavy yellow stuff curtains on the windows with its vases on pedestals and its open fireplaces its carved doors and gloomy reception rooms hung with pictures this palazzo did much by its very appearance after they had moved into it to confirm in vronsky the agreeable illusion that he was not so much a russian country gentleman a retired officer of the life guards as an enlightened amateur and patron of the arts himself a modest artist who had renounced the world his connections and his ambition for the sake of the woman he loved 
 the pose chosen by vronsky with their removal into the palazzo was completely successful and having through golenishchev made the acquaintance of a few interesting people for a time he was satisfied he painted studies from nature under the guidance of an italian professor of painting and studied medieval italian life medieval italian life so fascinated vronsky that even his hat and a plaid flung over his shoulder were worn in the medieval style which indeed was extremely becoming to him 
 here we live and know nothing of going on vronsky said to golenishchev when the latter came to see him one morning have you seen picture he said handing him a russian gazette he had received that morning and pointing to an article on a russian artist living in the very same town and just finishing a picture which had long been talked about and had been bought beforehand the article reproached the government and the academy for letting so remarkable an artist be left without encouragement and support 
 seen it answered golenishchev of course not without talent but all in a wrong direction all the attitude to christ and to religious painting 
 what is the subject of the picture asked anna 
 christ before pilate christ is represented as a jew with all the realism of the new school 
 and the question of the subject of the picture having brought him to one of his favorite theories golenishchev launched forth into a disquisition on it 
 i understand how they can fall into such a gross mistake christ always has his definite embodiment in the art of the great masters and therefore if they want to depict not god but a revolutionist or a sage let them take from history a socrates a franklin a charlotte corday but not christ they take the very figure which cannot be taken for their art and then 
 and is it true that this mikhailov is in such poverty asked vronsky thinking that as a russian maecenas it was his duty to assist the artist regardless of whether the picture were good or bad 
 hardly a remarkable portrait painter have you ever seen his portrait of madame vassilkova but i believe he care about painting any more portraits and so likely as not he may be in want i maintain that 
 we ask him to paint a portrait of anna arkadyevna said vronsky 
 why mine said anna after yours i want another portrait better have one of annie so she called her baby girl here she is she added looking out of the window at the handsome italian nurse who was carrying the child out into the garden and immediately glancing unperceived at vronsky the handsome nurse from whom vronsky was painting a head for his picture was the one hidden grief in life he painted with her as his model admired her beauty and medievalism and anna dared not confess to herself that she was afraid of becoming jealous of this nurse and was for that reason particularly gracious and condescending both to her and her little son 
 vronsky too glanced out of the window and into eyes and turning at once to golenishchev he said 
 do you know this mikhailov 
 i have met him but a queer fish and quite without breeding you know one of those savage new people one is forever coming across nowadays one of those freethinkers you know who are reared in theories of atheism negation and materialism in former days said golenishchev not observing or not willing to observe that both anna and vronsky wanted to speak in former days the freethinker was a man who had been brought up in ideas of religion law and morality and only through conflict and struggle came to free thought but now there has sprung up a new type of native freethinker who grows up without even having heard of principles of morality or of religion of the existence of authorities who grows up directly in ideas of negation in everything that is to say a savage well of that class the son it appears of some moscow butler and has never had any sort of when he got into the academy and made his reputation he tried as no fool to educate himself and he turned to what seemed to him the very source of culture the magazines in old times you see a man who wanted to educate himself a frenchman for instance would have set to work to study all the classics theologians and tragedians and historians and philosophers and you see all the intellectual work that came in his way but in our day he goes straight for the literature of negation very quickly assimilates all the extracts of the science of negation and all set and not all twenty years ago he would have found in that literature traces of conflict with authorities with the creeds of the ages he would have perceived from this conflict that there was something else but now he comes at once upon a literature in which the old creeds do not even furnish matter for discussion but it is stated baldly that there is nothing else just evolution natural selection the struggle for existence and all in my article 
 i tell you what said anna who had for a long while been exchanging wary glances with vronsky and knew that he was not in the least interested in the education of this artist but was simply absorbed by the idea of assisting him and ordering a portrait of him i tell you what she said resolutely interrupting golenishchev who was still talking away go and see him 
 golenishchev recovered his and readily agreed but as the artist lived in a remote ward of the town it was decided to take a carriage 
 an hour later anna with golenishchev by her side and vronsky on the front seat of the carriage facing them drove up to an ugly new house in a remote ward on learning from the wife who came out to them that mikhailov saw visitors at his studio but that at that moment he was in his lodging only a couple of steps off they sent her to him with their cards asking permission to see his pictures

 the artist mikhailov was as always at work when the cards of count vronsky and golenishchev were brought to him in the morning he had been working in his studio at his big picture on getting home he flew into a rage with his wife for not having managed to put off the landlady who had been asking for money 
 said it to you twenty times enter into details fool enough at all times and when you start explaining things in italian a triple fool he said after a long dispute 
 let it run so long not my fault if i had the money 
 leave me in peace for sake mikhailov shrieked with tears in his voice and stopping his ears he went off into his working room on the other side of a partition wall and closed the door after him no sense in her he said to himself sat down to the table and opening a portfolio he set to work at once with peculiar fervor at a sketch he had begun 
 never did he work with such fervor and success as when things went ill with him and especially when he quarreled with his wife oh damn them all he thought as he went on working he was making a sketch for the figure of a man in a violent rage a sketch had been made before but he was dissatisfied with it no that one was better where is it he went back to his wife and scowling and not looking at her asked his eldest little girl where was that piece of paper he had given them the paper with the discarded sketch on it was found but it was dirty and spotted with candle grease still he took the sketch laid it on his table and moving a little away screwing up his eyes he fell to gazing at it all at once he smiled and gesticulated gleefully 
 it it he said and at once picking up the pencil he began drawing rapidly the spot of tallow had given the man a new pose 
 he had sketched this new pose when all at once he recalled the face of a shopkeeper of whom he had bought cigars a vigorous face with a prominent chin and he sketched this very face this chin on to the figure of the man he laughed aloud with delight the figure from a lifeless imagined thing had become living and such that it could never be changed that figure lived and was clearly and unmistakably defined the sketch might be corrected in accordance with the requirements of the figure the legs indeed could and must be put differently and the position of the left hand must be quite altered the hair too might be thrown back but in making these corrections he was not altering the figure but simply getting rid of what concealed the figure he was as it were stripping off the veils which hindered it from being distinctly seen each new feature only brought out the whole figure in all its force and vigor as it had suddenly come to him from the spot of tallow he was carefully finishing the figure when the cards were brought him 
 coming coming 
 he went in to his wife 
 come sasha be cross he said smiling timidly and affectionately at her you were to blame i was to blame make it all right and having made peace with his wife he put on an overcoat with a velvet collar and a hat and went toward his studio the successful figure he had already forgotten now he was delighted and excited at the visit of these people of consequence russians who had come in their carriage 
 of his picture the one that stood now on his easel he had at the bottom of his heart one conviction that no one had ever painted a picture like it he did not believe that this picture was better than all the pictures of raphael but he knew that what he tried to convey in that picture no one ever had conveyed this he knew positively and had known a long while ever since he had begun to paint it but other criticisms whatever they might be had yet immense consequence in his eyes and they agitated him to the depths of his soul any remark the most insignificant which showed that the critic saw even the tiniest part of what he himself saw in the picture agitated him to the depths of his soul he always attributed to his judges a more profound comprehension than he had himself and always expected from them something he did not himself see in the picture and often in their criticisms he fancied that he found this 
 he walked rapidly to the door of his studio and in spite of his excitement he was struck by the soft light on figure as she stood in the shade of the entrance listening to golenishchev who was eagerly telling her something while she evidently wanted to look round at the artist he was himself unconscious how as he approached them he seized on this impression and absorbed it as he had the chin of the shopkeeper who had sold him the cigars and put it away somewhere to be brought out when he wanted it the visitors not agreeably impressed beforehand by account of the artist were still less so by his personal appearance thickset and of middle height with nimble movements with his brown hat coat and narrow trousers though wide trousers had been a long while in fashion most of all with the ordinariness of his broad face and the combined expression of timidity and anxiety to keep up his dignity mikhailov made an unpleasant impression 
 please step in he said trying to look indifferent and going into the passage he took a key out of his pocket and opened the door

 on entering the studio mikhailov once more scanned his visitors and noted down in his imagination expression too and especially his jaws although his artistic sense was unceasingly at work collecting materials although he felt a continually increasing excitement as the moment of criticizing his work drew nearer he rapidly and subtly formed from imperceptible signs a mental image of these three persons that fellow golenishchev was a russian living here mikhailov did not remember his surname nor where he had met him nor what he had said to him he only remembered his face as he remembered all the faces he had ever seen but he remembered too that it was one of the faces laid by in his memory in the immense class of the falsely consequential and poor in expression the abundant hair and very open forehead gave an appearance of consequence to the face which had only one expression a petty childish peevish expression concentrated just above the bridge of the narrow nose vronsky and madame karenina must be mikhailov supposed distinguished and wealthy russians knowing nothing about art like all those wealthy russians but posing as amateurs and connoisseurs most likely already looked at all the antiques and now making the round of the studios of the new people the german humbug and the cracked english fellow and have only come to me to make the point of view complete he thought he was well acquainted with the way dilettanti have the cleverer they were the worse he found them of looking at the works of contemporary artists with the sole object of being in a position to say that art is lost and the more one sees of the new men the more one sees how inimitable the works of the great old masters have remained he expected all this he saw it all in their faces he saw it in the careless indifference with which they talked among themselves stared at the lay figures and busts and walked about in leisurely fashion waiting for him to uncover his picture but in spite of this while he was turning over his studies pulling up the blinds and taking off the sheet he was in intense excitement especially as in spite of his conviction that all distinguished and wealthy russians were certain to be beasts and fools he liked vronsky and still more anna 
 here if you please he said moving on one side with his nimble gait and pointing to his picture the exhortation by pilate matthew chapter he said feeling his lips were beginning to tremble with emotion he moved away and stood behind them 
 for the few seconds during which the visitors were gazing at the picture in silence mikhailov too gazed at it with the indifferent eye of an outsider for those few seconds he was sure in anticipation that a higher juster criticism would be uttered by them by those very visitors whom he had been despising so a moment before he forgot all he had thought about his picture before during the three years he had been painting it he forgot all its qualities which had been absolutely certain to him he saw the picture with their indifferent new outside eyes and saw nothing good in it he saw in the foreground irritated face and the serene face of christ and in the background the figures of retinue and the face of john watching what was happening every face that with such exertion such blunders and corrections had grown up within him with its special character every face that had given him such torments and such raptures and all these faces so many times transposed for the sake of the harmony of the whole all the shades of color and tones that he had attained with such labor all of this together seemed to him now looking at it with their eyes the merest vulgarity something that had been done a thousand times over the face dearest to him the face of christ the center of the picture which had given him such ecstasy as it unfolded itself to him was utterly lost to him when he glanced at the picture with their eyes he saw a no not even that he distinctly saw now a mass of defects repetition of those endless christs of titian raphael rubens and the same soldiers and pilate it was all common poor and stale and badly painted weak and motley they would be justified in repeating hypocritically courteous speeches in the presence of the painter and pitying him and laughing at him when they were alone again 
 the silence though it lasted no more than a minute became too intolerable to him to break it and to show he was not agitated he made an effort and addressed golenishchev 
 i think had the pleasure of meeting you he said looking uneasily first at anna then at vronsky in fear of losing any shade of their expression 
 to be sure we met at do you remember at that soiree when that italian lady recited the new rachel golenishchev answered easily removing his eyes without the slightest regret from the picture and turning to the artist 
 noticing however that mikhailov was expecting a criticism of the picture he said 
 your picture has got on a great deal since i saw it last time and what strikes me particularly now as it did then is the figure of pilate one so knows the man a capital fellow but an official through and through who knows not what he doth but i fancy 
 all of mobile face beamed at once his eyes sparkled he tried to say something but he could not speak for excitement and pretended to be coughing low as was his opinion of capacity for understanding art trifling as was the true remark upon the fidelity of the expression of pilate as an official and offensive as might have seemed the utterance of so unimportant an observation while nothing was said of more serious points mikhailov was in an ecstasy of delight at this observation he had himself thought about figure just what golenishchev had said the fact that this reflection was but one of millions of reflections which as mikhailov knew for certain would be true did not diminish for him the significance of remark his heart warmed to golenishchev for this remark and from a state of depression he suddenly passed to ecstasy at once the whole of his picture lived before him in all the indescribable complexity of everything living mikhailov again tried to say that that was how he understood pilate but his lips quivered intractably and he could not pronounce the words vronsky and anna too said something in that subdued voice which partly to avoid hurting the feelings and partly to avoid giving loud utterance to something silly so easily done when talking of art people use at exhibitions of pictures mikhailov fancied that the picture had made an impression on them too he went up to them 
 how marvelous expression is said anna of all she saw she liked that expression most of all and she felt that it was the center of the picture and so praise of it would be pleasant to the artist one can see that he is pitying pilate 
 this again was one of the million true reflections that could be found in his picture and in the figure of christ she said that he was pitying pilate in expression there ought to be indeed an expression of pity since there is an expression of love of unearthly peace of preparedness for death and a sense of the vanity of words of course there is the expression of an official in pilate and of pity in christ considering that one is the incarnation of the fleshly and the other of the spiritual life all this and much more flashed into thoughts and his face beamed with delight again 
 yes and how that figure is done what atmosphere one can walk round it said golenishchev unmistakably betraying by this remark that he did not approve of the meaning and idea of the figure 
 yes a wonderful mastery said vronsky how those figures in the background stand out there you have technique he said addressing golenishchev alluding to a conversation between them about despair of attaining this technique 
 yes yes marvelous golenishchev and anna assented 
 in spite of the excited condition in which he was the sentence about technique had sent a pang to heart and looking angrily at vronsky he suddenly scowled he had often heard this word technique and was utterly unable to understand what was meant by it he knew that by this term was meant a mechanical dexterity for painting or drawing entirely apart from its subject he had noticed often that even in actual praise technique was opposed to essential quality as though one could paint well something that was bad he knew that a great deal of attention and care was necessary in taking off the veils to avoid injuring the creation itself and to take off all the veils but there was no art of painting no technique of any sort about it if to a little child or to his cook were revealed what he saw either would have been able to peel the veils off what was seen and the most experienced and adroit painter could not by mere mechanical faculty paint anything if the lines of the subject were not revealed to him first besides he saw that if it came to talking about technique it was impossible to praise him for it in all he had painted he saw faults that hurt his eyes coming from want of care in taking off the veils faults he could not correct now without spoiling the whole and in almost all the figures and faces he saw too remnants of the veils not perfectly removed that spoiled the picture 
 one thing might be said if you will allow me to make the remark observed golenishchev 
 oh i shall be delighted i beg of you to do so said mikhailov with a forced smile 
 that is you make him the and not the but i know that was what you meant to do 
 i cannot paint a christ that is not in my heart said mikhailov morosely 
 yes but in that case if you will allow me to say what i think your picture is so fine that my observation cannot detract from it and besides it is only my personal opinion with you it is different your very motive is different but let us take ivanov i imagine that if christ is brought down to the level of an historical character it would have been better for ivanov to select some other historical subject fresh untouched 
 but if this is the greatest subject presented to art 
 if one looked one would find others but the point is that art cannot suffer doubt and discussion and before the picture of ivanov the question arises for the believer and the unbeliever alike is it god or is it not god and the unity of the impression is destroyed 
 why so i think that for educated people said mikhailov the question cannot exist 
 golenishchev did not agree with this and confounded mikhailov by his support of his first idea of the unity of the impression being essential to art 
 mikhailov was greatly perturbed but he could say nothing in defense of his own idea

 anna and vronsky had long been exchanging glances regretting their flow of cleverness at last vronsky without waiting for the artist walked away to another small picture 
 oh how exquisite what a lovely thing a gem how exquisite they cried with one voice 
 what is it so pleased with thought mikhailov he had positively forgotten that picture he had painted three years ago he had forgotten all the agonies and the ecstasies he had lived through with that picture when for several months it had been the one thought haunting him day and night he had forgotten as he always forgot the pictures he had finished he did not even like to look at it and had only brought it out because he was expecting an englishman who wanted to buy it 
 oh only an old study he said 
 how fine said golenishchev he too with unmistakable sincerity falling under the spell of the picture 
 two boys were angling in the shade of a willow tree the elder had just dropped in the hook and was carefully pulling the float from behind a bush entirely absorbed in what he was doing the other a little younger was lying in the grass leaning on his elbows with his tangled flaxen head in his hands staring at the water with his dreamy blue eyes what was he thinking of 
 the enthusiasm over this picture stirred some of the old feeling for it in mikhailov but he feared and disliked this waste of feeling for things past and so even though this praise was grateful to him he tried to draw his visitors away to a third picture 
 but vronsky asked whether the picture was for sale to mikhailov at that moment excited by visitors it was extremely distasteful to speak of money matters 
 it is put up there to be sold he answered scowling gloomily 
 when the visitors had gone mikhailov sat down opposite the picture of pilate and christ and in his mind went over what had been said and what though not said had been implied by those visitors and strange to say what had had such weight with him while they were there and while he mentally put himself at their point of view suddenly lost all importance for him he began to look at his picture with all his own full vision and was soon in that mood of conviction of the perfectibility and so of the significance of his picture a conviction essential to the intensest fervor excluding all other interests in which alone he could work 
 foreshortened leg was not right though he took his palette and began to work as he corrected the leg he looked continually at the figure of john in the background which his visitors had not even noticed but which he knew was beyond perfection when he had finished the leg he wanted to touch that figure but he felt too much excited for that he was equally unable to work when he was cold and when he was too much affected and saw everything too clearly there was only one stage in the transition from coldness to inspiration at which work was possible today he was too much agitated he would have covered the picture but he stopped holding the cloth in his hand and smiling blissfully gazed a long while at the figure of john at last tearing himself away with evident regret he dropped the cloth and exhausted but happy went home 
 vronsky anna and golenishchev on their way home were particularly lively and cheerful they talked of mikhailov and his pictures the word talent by which they meant an inborn almost physical aptitude apart from brain and heart and in which they tried to find an expression for all the artist had gained from life recurred particularly often in their talk as though it were necessary for them to sum up what they had no conception of though they wanted to talk of it they said that there was no denying his talent but that his talent could not develop for want of education the common defect of our russian artists but the picture of the boys had imprinted itself on their memories and they were continually coming back to it what an exquisite thing how he has succeeded in it and how simply he even comprehend how good it is yes i let it slip i must buy it said vronsky

 mikhailov sold vronsky his picture and agreed to paint a portrait of anna on the day fixed he came and began the work 
 from the fifth sitting the portrait impressed everyone especially vronsky not only by its resemblance but by its characteristic beauty it was strange how mikhailov could have discovered precisely the beauty characteristic of her one needs to know and love her as i have loved her to discover the very sweetest expression of her soul vronsky thought though it was only from this portrait that he had himself learned this sweetest expression of her soul but the expression was so true that he and others too fancied they had long known it 
 i have been struggling on for ever so long without doing anything he said of his own portrait of her and he just looked and painted it where technique comes in 
 that will come was the consoling reassurance given him by golenishchev in whose view vronsky had both talent and what was most important education giving him an exalted outlook on art faith in talent was propped up by his own need of sympathy and approval for his own essays and ideas and he felt that the praise and support must be mutual 
 in another house and especially in palazzo mikhailov was quite a different man from what he was in his studio he behaved with hostile deference as though he were afraid of coming closer to people he did not respect he called vronsky your excellency and notwithstanding and invitations he would never stay to dinner nor come except for the sittings anna was even more friendly to him than to other people and was very grateful for her portrait vronsky was more than courteous with him and was obviously interested to know the opinion of his picture golenishchev never let slip an opportunity of instilling sound ideas about art into mikhailov but mikhailov remained equally chilly to all of these people anna was aware from his eyes that he liked to look at her but he avoided conversation with her talk about his painting he met with stubborn silence and he was as stubbornly silent when he was shown picture he was unmistakably bored by conversation and he did not attempt to oppose him 
 altogether mikhailov with his reserved and disagreeable and apparently hostile attitude was quite disliked by them as they got to know him better and they were glad when the sittings were over and they were left with a magnificent portrait in their possession and he gave up coming 
 golenishchev was the first to give expression to an idea that had occurred to all of them which was that mikhailov was simply envious of vronsky 
 not envious let us say since he has talent but it annoys him that a wealthy man of the highest society and a count too you know these fellows detest all that can without any particular trouble do as well if not better than he who has devoted all his life to it and more than all a question of education which he lacks 
 vronsky defended mikhailov but at the bottom of his heart he believed this because in his view a man of a different lower world would be sure to be envious 
 portrait the same subject painted from nature both by him and by mikhailov ought to have shown vronsky the difference between him and mikhailov but he did not see it only after portrait was painted did he leave off painting his own portrait of anna deciding that it was no longer needed his picture of medieval life he went on with and he himself and golenishchev and still more anna thought it very good because it was far more like the celebrated pictures they knew than picture 
 mikhailov meanwhile although portrait greatly fascinated him was even more glad than they were when the sittings were over and he had no longer to listen to disquisitions upon art and could forget about painting he knew that vronsky could not be prevented from amusing himself with painting he knew that he and all dilettanti had a perfect right to paint what they liked but it was distasteful to him a man could not be prevented from making himself a big wax doll and kissing it but if the man were to come with the doll and sit before a man in love and begin caressing his doll as the lover caressed the woman he loved it would be distasteful to the lover just such a distasteful sensation was what mikhailov felt at the sight of painting he felt it both ludicrous and irritating both pitiable and offensive 
 interest in painting and the middle ages did not last long he had enough taste for painting to be unable to finish his picture the picture came to a standstill he was vaguely aware that its defects inconspicuous at first would be glaring if he were to go on with it the same experience befell him as golenishchev who felt that he had nothing to say and continually deceived himself with the theory that his idea was not yet mature that he was working it out and collecting material this exasperated and tortured golenishchev but vronsky was incapable of deceiving and torturing himself and even more incapable of exasperation with his characteristic decision without explanation or apology he simply ceased work at painting 
 but without this occupation the life of vronsky and of anna who wondered at his loss of interest in it struck them as intolerably tedious in an italian town the palazzo suddenly seemed so obtrusively old and dirty the spots on the curtains the cracks in the floors the broken plaster on the cornices became so disagreeably obvious and the everlasting sameness of golenishchev and the italian professor and the german traveler became so wearisome that they had to make some change they resolved to go to russia to the country in peterburg vronsky intended to arrange a partition of the land with his brother while anna meant to see her son the summer they intended to spend on great family estate

 mikhailov meanwhile although portrait greatly fascinated him was even more glad than they were when the sittings were over and he had no longer to listen to disquisitions upon art and could forget about painting he knew that vronsky could not be prevented from amusing himself with painting he knew that he and all dilettanti had a perfect right to paint what they liked but it was distasteful to him a man could not be prevented from making himself a big wax doll and kissing it but if the man were to come with the doll and sit before a man in love and begin caressing his doll as the lover caressed the woman he loved it would be distasteful to the lover just such a distasteful sensation was what mikhailov felt at the sight of painting he felt it both ludicrous and irritating both pitiable and offensive 
 interest in painting and the middle ages did not last long he had enough taste for painting to be unable to finish his picture the picture came to a standstill he was vaguely aware that its defects inconspicuous at first would be glaring if he were to go on with it the same experience befell him as golenishchev who felt that he had nothing to say and continually deceived himself with the theory that his idea was not yet mature that he was working it out and collecting material this exasperated and tortured golenishchev but vronsky was incapable of deceiving and torturing himself and even more incapable of exasperation with his characteristic decision without explanation or apology he simply ceased work at painting 
 but without this occupation the life of vronsky and of anna who wondered at his loss of interest in it struck them as intolerably tedious in an italian town the palazzo suddenly seemed so obtrusively old and dirty the spots on the curtains the cracks in the floors the broken plaster on the cornices became so disagreeably obvious and the everlasting sameness of golenishchev and the italian professor and the german traveler became so wearisome that they had to make some change they resolved to go to russia to the country in peterburg vronsky intended to arrange a partition of the land with his brother while anna meant to see her son the summer they intended to spend on great family estate

 levin had been married two months he was happy but not at all in the way he had expected to be at every step he found disenchantment in his former dreams and new unexpected enchantment he was happy but on entering upon family life he saw at every step that it was utterly different from what he had imagined at every step he experienced what a man would experience who after admiring the smooth happy course of a little boat on a lake should get himself into that little boat he saw that it was not all sitting still and floating smoothly that one had to think too not for an instant forgetting where one was floating and that there was water under one and that one must row and that his unaccustomed hands would be sore and that it was only easy to look at but that doing it though very delightful was very difficult 
 as a bachelor when he had watched other married life had seen the petty cares the squabbles the jealousy he had only smiled contemptuously in his heart in his future married life there could be he was convinced nothing of that sort even the external forms indeed he fancied must be utterly unlike the life of others in everything and all of a sudden instead of his life with his wife being made on an individual pattern it was on the contrary entirely made up of the pettiest details which he had so despised before but which now by no will of his own had gained an extraordinary and indisputable importance and levin saw that the organization of all these details was by no means so easy as he had fancied before although levin believed himself to have the most exact conceptions of domestic life unconsciously like all men he pictured domestic life only as enjoyment of love with nothing to hinder and no petty cares to distract he ought as he conceived the position to do his work and to find repose from it in the happiness of love she ought to be beloved and nothing more but like all men he forgot that she too would want work and he was surprised that she his poetic exquisite kitty could not merely in the first weeks but even in the first days of their married life think remember and busy herself about tablecloths and furniture about mattresses for visitors about a tray about the cook and the dinner and so on while they were still engaged he had been struck by the definiteness with which she had declined the tour abroad and decided to go into the country as though she knew of something she wanted and could still think of something outside her love this had jarred upon him then and now her trivial cares and anxieties jarred upon him several times but he saw that this was essential for her and loving her as he did though he did not understand the reason for them and jeered at these domestic pursuits he could not help admiring them he jeered at the way in which she arranged the furniture they had brought from moscow rearranged their rooms hung up curtains prepared rooms for visitors and for dolly saw after an abode for her new maid ordered dinner of the old cook came into collision with agathya mikhailovna taking from her the charge of the stores he saw how the old cook smiled admiring her and listening to her inexperienced impossible orders how mournfully and tenderly agathya mikhailovna shook her head over the young new arrangements in the pantry he saw that kitty was extraordinarily sweet when laughing and crying she came to tell him that her maid masha was used to looking upon her as her young lady and so no one obeyed her it seemed to him sweet but strange and he thought it would have been better without this 
 he did not know how great a sense of change she was experiencing she who at home had sometimes wanted some pickled cabbage or sweets without the possibility of getting either now could order what she liked buy pounds of sweets spend as much money as she liked and order any cakes she pleased 
 she was dreaming with delight now of coming to them with her children especially because she would order for the children their favorite cakes and dolly would appreciate all her new housekeeping she did not know herself why and wherefore but the arranging of her house had an irresistible attraction for her instinctively feeling the approach of spring and knowing that there would be days of rough weather too she built her nest as best she could and was in haste at the same time to build and to learn how to do it 
 this care for domestic details in kitty so opposed to ideal of exalted happiness was at first one of the disenchantments and this sweet care of her household the aim of which he did not understand but could not help loving was one of the new enchantments 
 another disenchantment and enchantment consisted of their quarrels levin could never have conceived that between him and his wife any relations could arise other than tender respectful and loving and all at once in the very early days they quarreled so that she said he did not care for her that he cared for no one but himself burst into tears and waved her hands 
 this first quarrel arose from having gone out to a new grange and having been away half an hour too long because he had tried to get home by a short cut and had lost his way he drove home thinking of nothing but her of her love of his own happiness and the nearer he drew to home the warmer was his tenderness for her he ran into the room with the same feeling with an even stronger feeling than he had had when he reached the shcherbatskys house to propose and suddenly he was met by a lowering expression he had never seen in her he would have kissed her she pushed him away 
 what is it 
 been enjoying yourself she began trying to be calm and spiteful 
 but as soon as she opened her mouth she burst into a stream of reproach of senseless jealousy of all that had been torturing her during that which she had spent sitting motionless at the window it was only then for the first time that he clearly understood what he had not understood when he led her out of the church after the wedding he felt now that he was not simply close to her but that he did not know where he ended and she began he felt this from the agonizing sensation of division that he experienced at that instant he was offended for the first instant but the very same second he felt that he could not be offended by her that she was himself he felt for the first moment as a man feels when having suddenly received a violent blow from behind he turns round angry and eager to avenge himself to look for his antagonist and finds that it is he himself who has accidentally struck himself that there is no one to be angry with and that he must put up with and try to soothe the pain 
 never afterward did he feel it with such intensity but this first time he could not for a long while get over it his natural feeling urged him to defend himself to prove to her she was wrong but to prove her wrong would mean irritating her still more and making the rupture greater that was the cause of all his suffering one habitual feeling impelled him to get rid of the blame and to pass it on her another feeling even stronger impelled him as quickly as possible to smooth over the rupture without letting it grow greater to remain under such undeserved reproach was wretched but to make her suffer by justifying himself was worse still like a man in an agony of pain he wanted to tear out to fling away the seat of pain and coming to his senses he felt that the seat of pain was himself he could do nothing but try to help the seat of pain bear it and this he tried to do 
 they made peace she recognizing that she was wrong though she did not say so became tenderer to him and they experienced new redoubled happiness in their love but that did not prevent such quarrels from happening again and exceedingly often too on the most unexpected and trivial grounds these quarrels frequently arose from the fact that they did not yet know what was of importance to each and that all this early period they were both often in a bad temper when one was in a good temper and the other in a bad temper the peace was not broken but when both happened to be in an quarrels sprang up from such incomprehensibly trifling causes that they could never remember afterward what they had quarreled about it is true that when they were both in a good temper their enjoyment of life was redoubled but still this first period of their married life was a difficult time for them 
 during all this early period they had a peculiarly vivid sense of tension as it were a tugging in opposite directions of the chain by which they were bound altogether their honeymoon that is to say the month after their wedding from which through tradition levin had expected so much was not merely not a time of sweetness but remained in the memories of both as the bitterest and most humiliating period in their lives they both alike tried in later life to blot out from their memories all the monstrous shameful incidents of that morbid period when both were rarely in a normal frame of mind when both were rarely quite themselves

 they had just come back from moscow and were glad to be alone he was sitting at the writing table in his study writing she wearing the dark lilac dress she had worn during the first days of their married life and put on again today a dress particularly remembered and loved by him was sitting on the sofa the same leather sofa which had always stood in the study in and days she was sewing at broderie anglaise he thought and wrote never losing the happy consciousness of her presence his work both on the land and on the book in which the principles of the new land system were to be laid down had not been abandoned but just as formerly his work and ideas had seemed to him petty and trivial in comparison with the darkness that overspread all life now they seemed as unimportant and petty in comparison with the life that lay before him suffused with the brilliant light of happiness he went on with his work but he felt now that the center of gravity of his attention had passed to something else and that consequently he looked at his work quite differently and more clearly formerly this work had been for him an escape from life formerly he had felt that without this work his life would be too gloomy now this work was necessary for him so that life might not be too uniformly bright taking up his manuscript reading through what he had written he found with pleasure that the work was worth his working at many of his old ideas seemed to him superfluous and extreme but many blanks became distinct to him when he reviewed the whole thing in his memory he was writing now a new chapter on the causes of the present disadvantageous condition of agriculture in russia he maintained that the poverty of russia arises not merely from the anomalous distribution of landed property and from misdirected reforms but that what had contributed of late years to this result was a civilization from without abnormally grafted upon russia especially facilities of communication such as railways leading to centralization in towns the development of luxury and the consequent development of manufactures credit and its accompaniment of speculation all to the detriment of agriculture it seemed to him that in a normal development of wealth in a state all these phenomena would arise only when a considerable amount of labor had been put into agriculture when it had come under regular or at least definite conditions that the wealth of a country ought to increase proportionally and especially in such a way that other sources of wealth should not outstrip agriculture that in harmony with a certain stage of agriculture there should be means of communication corresponding to it and that in our unsettled condition of the land railways called into being by political and not by economic needs were premature and instead of promoting agriculture as was expected of them they were competing with agriculture and promoting the development of manufactures and credit and so arresting its progress and that just as the and premature development of one organ in an animal would hinder its general development so in the general development of wealth in russia credit facilities of communication manufacturing activity indubitably necessary in europe where they had arisen in their proper time had with us only done harm by throwing into the background the chief question next in turn of the organization of agriculture

 chapter 
 
 when levin went upstairs his wife was sitting near the new silver samovar and the new tea service and having settled old agathya mikhailovna at a little table with a full cup of tea was reading a letter from dolly with whom they were in continual and frequent correspondence 
 you see your settled me here told me to sit a bit with her said agathya mikhailovna smiling amicably at kitty 
 in these words of agathya mikhailovna levin read the final act of the drama which had been enacted of late between her and kitty he saw that in spite of agathya feelings being hurt by a new mistress taking the reins of government out of her hands kitty had yet conquered her and made her love her 
 here i opened your letter too said kitty handing him an illiterate letter from that woman i think your she said i did not read it through this is from my people and from dolly fancy dolly took tania and grisha to a ball at the sarmatskys tania was a french marquise 
 but levin did not hear her flushing he took the letter from marya nikolaevna his former mistress and began to read it this was the second letter he had received from marya nikolaevna in the first letter marya nikolaevna wrote that his brother had sent her packing for no fault of hers and with touching simplicity added that though she was in want again she asked for nothing and wished for nothing but was only tormented by the thought that nikolai dmitrievich would come to grief without her owing to the weak state of his health and begged his brother to look after him now she wrote quite differently she had found nikolai dmitrievich had again made it up with him in moscow and had moved with him to a provincial town where he had received a post in the government service but she wrote he had quarreled with the head official and was on his way back to moscow only he had been taken so ill on the road that it was doubtful if he would ever leave his bed again always of you he has talked and besides he has no more money left 
 read this dolly writes about you kitty was beginning with a smile but she stopped suddenly noticing the changed expression on her face what is it the matter 
 she writes to me that nikolai my brother is at door i shall go to him 
 face changed at once thoughts of tania as a marquise of dolly all had vanished 
 when are you going she said 
 tomorrow 
 and i will go with you may i she said

 when levin went upstairs his wife was sitting near the new silver samovar and the new tea service and having settled old agathya mikhailovna at a little table with a full cup of tea was reading a letter from dolly with whom they were in continual and frequent correspondence 
 you see your settled me here told me to sit a bit with her said agathya mikhailovna smiling amicably at kitty 
 in these words of agathya mikhailovna levin read the final act of the drama which had been enacted of late between her and kitty he saw that in spite of agathya feelings being hurt by a new mistress taking the reins of government out of her hands kitty had yet conquered her and made her love her 
 here i opened your letter too said kitty handing him an illiterate letter from that woman i think your she said i did not read it through this is from my people and from dolly fancy dolly took tania and grisha to a ball at the sarmatskys tania was a french marquise 
 but levin did not hear her flushing he took the letter from marya nikolaevna his former mistress and began to read it this was the second letter he had received from marya nikolaevna in the first letter marya nikolaevna wrote that his brother had sent her packing for no fault of hers and with touching simplicity added that though she was in want again she asked for nothing and wished for nothing but was only tormented by the thought that nikolai dmitrievich would come to grief without her owing to the weak state of his health and begged his brother to look after him now she wrote quite differently she had found nikolai dmitrievich had again made it up with him in moscow and had moved with him to a provincial town where he had received a post in the government service but she wrote he had quarreled with the head official and was on his way back to moscow only he had been taken so ill on the road that it was doubtful if he would ever leave his bed again always of you he has talked and besides he has no more money left 
 read this dolly writes about you kitty was beginning with a smile but she stopped suddenly noticing the changed expression on her face what is it the matter 
 she writes to me that nikolai my brother is at door i shall go to him 
 face changed at once thoughts of tania as a marquise of dolly all had vanished 
 when are you going she said 
 tomorrow

 the hotel of the provincial town where nikolai levin was lying ill was one of those provincial hotels which are constructed on the newest model of modern improvements with the best intentions of cleanliness comfort and even elegance but owing to the public that patronizes them are with astounding rapidity transformed into filthy taverns with a pretension of modern improvement and made by the very pretension worse than the honestly filthy hotels this hotel had already reached that stage and the soldier in a filthy uniform smoking in the entry supposed to stand for a hall porter and the perforated somber and disagreeable staircase and the free and easy waiter in a filthy dress coat and the common dining room with a dusty bouquet of wax flowers adorning the table and filth dust and disorder everywhere and at the same time the sort of modern railway uneasiness of this hotel aroused a most painful feeling in levin after their fresh young life especially because the impression of falsity made by the hotel was so out of keeping with what awaited them 
 as is invariably the case after they had been asked at what price they wanted rooms it appeared that there was not one decent room for them one decent room had been taken by the inspector of railroads another by a lawyer from moscow a third by princess astafieva just arrived from the country there remained only one filthy room next to which they promised that another should be empty by the evening feeling angry with his wife because what he had expected had come to pass that at the moment of arrival when his heart throbbed with emotion and anxiety to know how his brother was getting on he should have to be seeing after her instead of rushing straight to his brother levin conducted her to the room assigned them 
 go do go she said looking at him with timid and guilty eyes 
 he went out of the door without a word and at once stumbled over marya nikolaevna who had heard of his arrival and had not dared to go in to see him she was just the same as when he had seen her in moscow the same woolen gown and bare arms and neck and the same stupid face only a little plumper 
 well how is he how is he 
 very bad he get up he has been expecting you all this while he are you with your wife 
 levin did not for the first moment understand what confused her but she immediately enlightened him 
 go away go down to the kitchen she brought out nikolai dmitrievich will be delighted he heard about it and knows her and remembers her abroad 
 levin realized that she meant his wife and did not know what answer to make 
 come along come along to him he said 
 but as soon as he moved the door of his room opened and kitty peeped out levin crimsoned both from shame and anger at his wife who had put herself and him in such a difficult position but marya nikolaevna crimsoned still more she positively shrank together and flushed to the point of tears and clutching the ends of her shawl in both hands twisted them in her red fingers without knowing what to say and what to do 
 for the first instant levin saw an expression of eager curiosity in the eyes with which kitty looked at this incomprehensible to her awful woman but it lasted only a single instant 
 well how is he she turned to her husband and then to her 
 but one go on talking in the passage like this levin said looking angrily at a gentleman who walked jauntily at that instant across the corridor as though about his affairs 
 well then come in said kitty turning to marya nikolaevna who had recovered herself but noticing her face of dismay or go on go and then come for me she said and went back into the room levin went to his room 
 he had not in the least expected what he saw and felt in his room he had expected to find him in the same state of which he had heard was so frequent with the consumptive and which had struck him so much during his visit in the autumn he had expected to find the physical signs of the approach of death more marked greater weakness greater emaciation but still almost the same condition of things he had expected himself to feel the same distress at the loss of the brother he loved and the same horror in face of death as he had felt then only in a greater degree and he had prepared himself for this but he found something utterly different 
 in a little dirty room with the painted panels of its walls filthy with spittle with conversation audible from the next room through the thin partition in a stifling atmosphere saturated with impurities on a bedstead moved away from the wall there lay covered with a quilt a body one arm of this body was above the quilt and the wrist huge as a rake handle was attached inconceivably it seemed to the thin long bobbin smooth from the beginning to the middle the head lay sideways on the pillow levin could see the scanty locks wet with sweat on the temples and the tensed seemingly transparent forehead 
 it cannot be that that fearful body was my brother nikolai thought levin but he went closer saw the face and doubt became impossible in spite of the terrible change in the face levin had only to glance at those eager eyes at his approach only to catch the faint movement of the mouth under the sticky mustache to realize the terrible truth that this dead body was his living brother 
 the glittering eyes looked sternly and reproachfully at the brother as he drew near and immediately this glance established a living relationship between living men levin immediately felt the reproach in the eyes fixed on him and felt remorse at his own happiness 
 when konstantin took him by the hand nikolai smiled the smile was faint scarcely perceptible and in spite of the smile the stern expression of the eyes was unchanged 
 you did not expect to find me like this he articulated with effort 
 yes no said levin hesitating over his words how was it you let me know before that is at the time of my wedding i made inquiries in all directions 
 he had to talk so as not to be silent and he did not know what to say especially as his brother made no reply and simply stared without dropping his eyes and apparently penetrated to the inner meaning of each word levin told his brother that his wife had come with him nikolai expressed pleasure but said he was afraid of frightening her by his condition a silence followed suddenly nikolai stirred and began to say something levin expected something of peculiar gravity and importance from the expression of his face but nikolai began speaking of his health he found fault with the doctor regretting he had not a celebrated moscow doctor levin saw that he still had hopes 
 seizing the first moment of silence levin got up anxious to escape if only for an instant from his agonizing emotion and said that he would go and fetch his wife 
 very well and tell masha to tidy up here dirty and stinking here i expect masha clear up the room the sick man said with effort and when cleared up you go away he added looking inquiringly at his brother 
 levin made no answer going out into the corridor he stopped short he had said he would fetch his wife but now taking stock of the emotion he was feeling he decided that on the contrary he would try to persuade her not to go in to the sick man why should she suffer as i am suffering he thought 
 well how is he kitty asked with a frightened face 
 oh awful awful what did you come for said levin 
 kitty was silent for a few seconds looking timidly and ruefully at her husband then she went up and took him by the elbow with both hands 
 kostia take me to him it will be easier for us to bear it together only take me take me to him please and go away she said you must understand that for me to see you and not to see him is far more painful there i might be a help to you and to him please let me she besought her husband as though the happiness of her life depended on it 
 levin was obliged to agree and regaining his composure and completely forgetting about marya nikolaevna by now he went again in to his brother with kitty 
 stepping lightly and continually glancing at her husband showing him a valorous and sympathetic face kitty went into the sickroom and turning without haste noiselessly closed the door with inaudible steps she went quickly to the sick bedside and going up so that he would not have to turn his head she immediately clasped in her fresh young hand the skeleton of his huge hand pressed it and began speaking with that soft eagerness sympathetic and inoffensive which is peculiar merely to women 
 we have met though we were not acquainted at soden she said you never thought i was to be your sister 
 you would not have recognized me he said with a smile which had become radiant at her entrance 
 yes i should what a good thing you let us know not a day has passed that kostia has not mentioned you and been anxious 
 but the sick interest did not last long 
 before she had finished speaking there had come back into his face the stern reproachful expression of the dying envy of the living 
 i am afraid you are not quite comfortable here she said turning away from his fixed stare and looking about the room we must ask about another room she said to her husband so that we might be nearer

 levin could not look calmly at his brother he could not himself be natural and calm in his presence when he went in to the sick man his eyes and his attention were unconsciously dimmed and he did not see and did not distinguish the details of his position he smelt the awful odor saw the dirt disorder and miserable condition and heard the groans and felt that nothing could be done to help it never entered his head to analyze the details of the sick situation to consider how that body was lying under the quilt how those emaciated legs and thighs and spine were lying huddled up and whether they could not be made more comfortable whether anything could not be done to make things if not better at least not so bad it made his blood run cold when he began to think of all these details he was absolutely convinced that nothing could be done to prolong his life or to relieve his suffering but a consciousness of regarding all aid as out of the question was felt by the sick man and exasperated him and this made it still more painful for levin to be in the sickroom was agony to him not to be there was still worse and he was continually on various pretexts going out of the room and coming in again because he was unable to remain alone 
 but kitty thought and felt and acted quite differently on seeing the sick man she pitied him and pity in her womanly heart did not arouse at all that feeling of horror and loathing that it aroused in her husband but a desire to act to find out all the details of his state and to remedy them and since she had not the slightest doubt that it was her duty to help him she had no doubt either that it was possible and immediately set to work the very details the mere thought of which reduced her husband to terror immediately engaged her attention she sent for the doctor sent to the set the maid who had come with her and marya nikolaevna to sweep and dust and scrub she herself washed up something washed out something else laid something under the quilt something was by her direction brought into the sickroom something else was carried out she herself went several times to her room regardless of the men she met in the corridor got out and brought in sheets pillowcases towels and shirts 
 the waiter who was busy with a party of engineers dining in the dining hall came several times with an irate countenance in answer to her summons and could not avoid carrying out her orders as she gave them with such gracious insistence that there was no evading her levin did not approve of all this he did not believe it would be of any good to the patient above all he was afraid the patient would be angry at it but the sick man though he seemed to be indifferent about it was not angry but only abashed and on the whole seemed interested in what she was doing with him coming back from the doctor to whom kitty had sent him levin on opening the door came upon the sick man at the instant when by direction they were changing his linen the long white ridge of his spine with the huge prominent shoulder blades and jutting ribs and vertebrae was bare and marya nikolaevna and the waiter were struggling with the sleeve of the nightshirt and could not get the long limp arm into it kitty hurriedly closing the door after levin did not look in that direction but the sick man groaned and she moved rapidly toward him 
 come a little quicker she said 
 oh you come said the sick man angrily do it myself 
 what did you say queried marya nikolaevna 
 but kitty heard and saw he was ashamed and uncomfortable at being naked before her 
 not looking not looking she said putting the arm in marya nikolaevna you come this side you do it she added 
 please run over for me a little bottle in my small bag she said turning to her husband you know in the side pocket bring it please and meanwhile finish clearing up here 
 returning with the bottle levin found the sick man settled comfortably and everything about him completely changed the heavy smell was replaced by the smell of aromatic vinegar which kitty with pouting lips and rosy cheeks was squirting through a small tube there was no dust visible anywhere a rug was laid by the bedside on the table stood medicine bottles and decanters tidily arranged and the linen needed was folded up there and broderie anglaise on the other table by the bed there were candles and drink and powders the sick man himself washed and combed lay in clean sheets on high raised pillows in a clean nightshirt with a white collar about his astoundingly thin neck and with a new expression of hope was looking fixedly at kitty 
 the doctor brought by levin and found by him at the club was not the one who had been attending nikolai levin and whom he disliked the new doctor took up a stethoscope and sounded the patient shook his head prescribed medicine and with extreme minuteness explained first how to take the medicine and then what diet was to be adhered to he advised eggs raw or hardly cooked and seltzer water with new milk at a certain temperature when the doctor had gone away the sick man said something to his brother of which levin could distinguish only the last words your katia by the expression with which he gazed at her levin saw that he was praising her he beckoned to him katia as he called her 
 much better already he said why with you i should have got well long ago how fine everything is he took her hand and drew it toward his lips but as though afraid she would dislike it he changed his mind let it go and only stroked it kitty took his hand in both of hers and squeezed it 
 now turn me over on the left side and go to bed he said 
 no one could make out what he said but kitty she alone understood she understood because she was all the while mentally keeping watch on what he needed 
 on the other side she said to her husband he always sleeps on that side turn him over so disagreeable calling the servants not strong enough can you she said to marya nikolaevna 
 afraid answered marya nikolaevna 
 terrible as it was to levin to put his arms round that terrible body to take hold under the quilt of that of which he preferred to know nothing under his influence he made his resolute face that she knew so well and putting his arms into the bed took hold of the body but in spite of his own strength he was struck by the strange heaviness of those powerless limbs while he was turning him over conscious of the huge emaciated arm about his neck kitty swiftly and noiselessly turned the pillow beat it up and settled in it the sick head smoothing back his hair which was sticking again to his moist brow 
 the sick man kept his hand in his own levin felt that he meant to do something with his hand and was pulling it somewhere levin yielded with a sinking heart yes he drew it to his mouth and kissed it levin shaking with sobs and unable to articulate a word went out of the room

 the waiter who was busy with a party of engineers dining in the dining hall came several times with an irate countenance in answer to her summons and could not avoid carrying out her orders as she gave them with such gracious insistence that there was no evading her levin did not approve of all this he did not believe it would be of any good to the patient above all he was afraid the patient would be angry at it but the sick man though he seemed to be indifferent about it was not angry but only abashed and on the whole seemed interested in what she was doing with him coming back from the doctor to whom kitty had sent him levin on opening the door came upon the sick man at the instant when by direction they were changing his linen the long white ridge of his spine with the huge prominent shoulder blades and jutting ribs and vertebrae was bare and marya nikolaevna and the waiter were struggling with the sleeve of the nightshirt and could not get the long limp arm into it kitty hurriedly closing the door after levin did not look in that direction but the sick man groaned and she moved rapidly toward him 
 come a little quicker she said 
 oh you come said the sick man angrily do it myself 
 what did you say queried marya nikolaevna 
 but kitty heard and saw he was ashamed and uncomfortable at being naked before her 
 not looking not looking she said putting the arm in marya nikolaevna you come this side you do it she added 
 please run over for me a little bottle in my small bag she said turning to her husband you know in the side pocket bring it please and meanwhile finish clearing up here 
 returning with the bottle levin found the sick man settled comfortably and everything about him completely changed the heavy smell was replaced by the smell of aromatic vinegar which kitty with pouting lips and rosy cheeks was squirting through a small tube there was no dust visible anywhere a rug was laid by the bedside on the table stood medicine bottles and decanters tidily arranged and the linen needed was folded up there and broderie anglaise on the other table by the bed there were candles and drink and powders the sick man himself washed and combed lay in clean sheets on high raised pillows in a clean nightshirt with a white collar about his astoundingly thin neck and with a new expression of hope was looking fixedly at kitty 
 the doctor brought by levin and found by him at the club was not the one who had been attending nikolai levin and whom he disliked the new doctor took up a stethoscope and sounded the patient shook his head prescribed medicine and with extreme minuteness explained first how to take the medicine and then what diet was to be adhered to he advised eggs raw or hardly cooked and seltzer water with new milk at a certain temperature when the doctor had gone away the sick man said something to his brother of which levin could distinguish only the last words your katia by the expression with which he gazed at her levin saw that he was praising her he beckoned to him katia as he called her 
 much better already he said why with you i should have got well long ago how fine everything is he took her hand and drew it toward his lips but as though afraid she would dislike it he changed his mind let it go and only stroked it kitty took his hand in both of hers and squeezed it 
 now turn me over on the left side and go to bed he said 
 no one could make out what he said but kitty she alone understood she understood because she was all the while mentally keeping watch on what he needed 
 on the other side she said to her husband he always sleeps on that side turn him over so disagreeable calling the servants not strong enough can you she said to marya nikolaevna 
 afraid answered marya nikolaevna 
 terrible as it was to levin to put his arms round that terrible body to take hold under the quilt of that of which he preferred to know nothing under his influence he made his resolute face that she knew so well and putting his arms into the bed took hold of the body but in spite of his own strength he was struck by the strange heaviness of those powerless limbs while he was turning him over conscious of the huge emaciated arm about his neck kitty swiftly and noiselessly turned the pillow beat it up and settled in it the sick head smoothing back his hair which was sticking again to his moist brow 
 the sick man kept his hand in his own levin felt that he meant to do something with his hand and was pulling it somewhere levin yielded with a sinking heart yes he drew it to his mouth and kissed it levin shaking with sobs and unable to articulate a word went out of the room

 thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent and hast revealed them unto babes so levin thought about his wife as he talked to her that evening 
 levin thought of the text not because he considered himself wise and prudent he did not consider himself wise and prudent but he could not help knowing that he had more intellect than his wife and agathya mikhailovna and he could not help knowing that when he thought of death he thought with all the force of his intellect he knew too that the brains of many great men whose thoughts he had read had brooded over death and yet knew not a hundredth part of what his wife and agathya mikhailovna knew about it different as those two women were agathya mikhailovna and katia as his brother nikolai had called her and as levin particularly liked to call her now they were quite alike in this both knew without a shade of doubt what sort of thing life was and what was death and though neither of them could have answered and would not even have understood the questions that presented themselves to levin both had no doubt of the significance of this event and were precisely alike in their way of looking at it which they shared with millions of people the proof that they knew for a certainty the nature of death lay in the fact that they knew without a second of hesitation how to deal with the dying and were not frightened by them levin and other men like him though they could have said a great deal about death obviously did not know this since they were afraid of death and were absolutely at a loss what to do when people were dying if levin had been alone now with his brother nikolai he would have looked at him with terror and with still greater terror waited and would not have known what else to do 
 more than that he did not know what to say how to look how to move to talk of outside things seemed to him shocking impossible to talk of death and depressing subjects also impossible to be silent was also impossible if i look at him he will think i am studying him i am afraid of him if i look at him think thinking of other things if i walk on tiptoe he will be vexed to tread firmly ashamed kitty evidently did not think of herself and had no time to think about herself she was thinking about him because she knew something and all went well she even told him about herself and about her wedding and smiled and sympathized with him and petted him and talked of cases of recovery and all went well therefore she must know the proof that her behavior and agathya was not instinctive animal irrational lay in that apart from the physical treatment the relief of suffering both agathya mikhailovna and kitty required for the dying man something else more important than the physical treatment and something which had nothing in common with physical conditions agathya mikhailovna speaking of a man recently dead had said well thank god he took the sacrament and received extreme unction god grant each one of us such a death katia in just the same way besides all her care about linen bedsores drink found time the very first day to persuade the sick man of the necessity of taking the sacrament and receiving extreme unction 
 on getting back from the sickroom to their own two rooms for the night levin sat with hanging head not knowing what to do to say nothing of supper of preparing for bed of considering what they were going to do he could not even talk to his wife he was ashamed to kitty on the contrary was more active than usual she was even livelier than usual she ordered supper to be brought herself unpacked their things and herself helped to make the beds and did not even forget to sprinkle them with persian insecticide she showed that alertness that swiftness of reflection which comes out in men before a battle in conflict in the dangerous and decisive moments of life those moments when a man shows once and for all his value and that all his past has not been wasted but has been a preparation for these moments 
 everything went rapidly in her hands and before it was twelve all their things were arranged tidily and orderly in such a way that the hotel rooms seemed like home like her rooms the beds were made brushes combs looking glasses were put out table napkins were spread 
 levin felt that it was unpardonable to eat to sleep to talk even now and it seemed to him that every movement he made was unseemly she arranged the brushes but she did it all so that there was nothing shocking in it 
 they could neither of them eat however and for a long while they could not sleep and did not even go to bed 
 i am very glad i persuaded him to receive extreme unction tomorrow she said sitting in her dressing jacket before her folding looking glass combing her soft fragrant hair with a comb i have never seen it but i know mamma has told me there are prayers said for recovery 
 do you suppose he can possibly recover said levin watching a slender tress at the back of her round little head that was continually hidden when she passed the comb through the front 
 i asked the doctor he said he live more than three days but can they be sure very glad anyway that i persuaded him she said looking askance at her husband through her hair anything is possible she added with that peculiar rather sly expression that was always in her face when she spoke of religion 
 since their conversation about religion during their engagement neither of them had ever started a discussion of the subject but she performed all the ceremonies of going to church saying her prayers and so on always with the unvarying conviction that this ought to be so in spite of his assertion to the contrary she was firmly persuaded that he was as much a christian as she and indeed a far better one and all that he said about it was simply one of his absurd masculine freaks just as he would say about her broderie anglaise that good people patch holes but that she cut them out on purpose and so on 
 yes you see this woman marya nikolaevna did not know how to manage all this said levin and i must own very very glad you came you are such purity that he took her hand and did not kiss it to kiss her hand in such closeness to death seemed to him improper he merely squeezed it with a penitent air looking at her brightening eyes 
 it would have been miserable for you to be alone she said and lifting her hands which hid her cheeks flushing with pleasure twisted her coil of hair on the nape of her neck and pinned it there no she went on she did not know how luckily i learned lot at soden 
 surely there are no people there so ill 
 worse 
 so awful to me is that i but see him as he was when he was young you would not believe how charming he was as a youth but i did not understand him then 
 i can quite quite believe it how i feel that we might have been friends she said and distressed at what she had said she looked round at her husband and tears came into her eyes 
 yes might have been he said mournfully just one of those people of whom they say that they are not for this world 
 but we have many days before us we must go to bed said kitty glancing at her tiny watch

 death 
 the next day the sick man received the sacrament and extreme unction during the ceremony nikolai levin prayed fervently his great eyes fastened on the holy icon that was set out on a card table covered with a colored napkin expressed such passionate prayer and hope that it was awful to levin to see it levin knew that this passionate prayer and hope would only make him feel more bitterly the parting from the life he so loved levin knew his brother and the workings of his intellect he knew that his unbelief came not from life being easier for him without faith but had grown up because step by step the contemporary scientific interpretation of natural phenomena crushed out the possibility of faith and so he knew that his present return was not a legitimate one brought about by way of the same working of his intellect but simply a temporary interested return to faith in a desperate hope of recovery levin knew too that kitty had strengthened his hope by accounts of the marvelous recoveries she had heard of levin knew all this and it was agonizingly painful to him to behold the supplicating hopeful eyes and the emaciated wrist lifted with difficulty making the sign of the cross on the tense brow and the prominent shoulders and hollow gasping chest which one could not feel consistent with the life the sick man was praying for during the sacrament levin offered prayers and did what he an unbeliever had done a thousand times he said addressing god if thou dost exist make this man recover of course this same thing has been repeated many times and thou wilt save him and me 
 after extreme unction the sick man became suddenly much better he did not cough once in the course of an hour smiled kissed hand thanking her with tears and said he was comfortable free from pain and that he felt strong and had an appetite he even raised himself when his soup was brought and asked for a cutlet as well hopelessly ill as he was obvious as it was at the first glance that he could not recover levin and kitty were for that hour both in the same state of excitement happy though fearful of being mistaken 
 is he better yes much wonderful nothing wonderful in it anyway better they said in a whisper smiling to one another 
 this was not of long duration the sick man fell into a quiet sleep but he was waked up half an hour later by his cough and all at once every hope vanished in those about him and in himself the reality of his suffering crushed all hopes in levin and kitty and in the sick man himself leaving no doubt no memory even of past hopes 
 without referring to what he had believed in half an hour before as though ashamed even to recall it he asked for iodine to inhale in a bottle covered with perforated paper levin gave him the bottle and the same look of passionate hope with which he had taken the sacrament was now fastened on his brother demanding from him the confirmation of the words that inhaling iodine worked wonders 
 katia here he gasped looking round while levin reluctantly assented to the words no then i can say it it was for her sake i went through that farce so sweet but you and i deceive ourselves this is what i believe in he said and squeezing the bottle in his bony hand he began breathing over it 
 at eight in the evening levin and his wife were drinking tea in their room when marya nikolaevna ran in to them breathlessly she was pale and her lips were quivering he is dying she whispered afraid he will die right away 
 both of them ran to him he was sitting raised up with one elbow on the bed his long back bent and his head hanging low 
 how do you feel levin asked in a whisper after a silence 
 i feel setting off nikolai said with difficulty but with extreme distinctness deliberately squeezing the words out of himself he did not raise his head but simply turned his eyes upward without their reaching his face katia go away he added 
 levin jumped up and with a peremptory whisper made her go out 
 setting off he said again 
 why do you think so said levin so as to say something 
 because setting off he repeated as though he had a liking for the phrase the end 
 marya nikolaevna went up to him 
 you had better lie down be easier she said 
 i shall lie down soon enough he pronounced slowly when dead he said sarcastically wrathfully well you can put me down if you like 
 levin laid his brother on his back sat down beside him and gazed at his face holding his breath the dying man lay with closed eyes but the muscles twitched from time to time on his forehead as with one thinking deeply and intensely levin involuntarily thought with him of what it was that was happening to him now but in spite of all his mental efforts to keep him company he saw by the expression of that calm stern face and by the playing muscle above his brow that for the dying man there was growing clearer and clearer all that was still as dark as ever for levin 
 yes yes so the dying man articulated slowly at intervals wait a little he was silent again right he pronounced all at once reassuringly as though all were solved for him o lord he murmured and sighed deeply 
 marya nikolaevna felt his feet getting cold she whispered 
 for a long while a very long while it seemed to levin the sick man lay motionless but he was still alive and from time to time he sighed levin by now was exhausted from mental strain he felt that with no mental effort could he understand what it was that was right he felt that he could not follow the dying thinking he could not even think of the problem of death itself but with no will of his own thoughts kept coming to him of what he had to do next closing the dead eyes dressing him ordering the coffin and strange to say he felt utterly cold and was not conscious of sorrow nor of loss less still of pity for his brother if he had any feeling for his brother at that moment it was rather envy for the knowledge the dying man had now which he could not have 
 a long time more he sat over him so continually expecting the end but the end did not come the door opened and kitty appeared levin got up to stop her but at the moment he was getting up he caught the sound of the dying man stirring 
 go away said nikolai and held out his hand levin gave him his and angrily waved to his wife to go away 
 with the dying hand in his hand he sat for half an hour an hour another hour he did not think of death at all now he wondered what kitty was doing who lived in the next room whether the doctor lived in a house of his own he longed for food and for sleep he cautiously drew away his hand and felt the feet the feet were cold but the sick man was still breathing levin tried once more to move away on tiptoe but the sick man stirred again and said go 
 the dawn came the sick condition was unchanged levin stealthily withdrew his hand and without looking at the dying man went off to his own room and went to sleep when he woke up instead of news of his death which he expected he learned that the sick man had returned to his earlier condition he had begun sitting up again coughing had begun eating again talking again and again had ceased to talk of death again had begun to express hope of his recovery and had become more irritable and gloomier than ever no one neither his brother nor kitty could soothe him he was angry with everyone and said nasty things to everyone reproached everyone for his sufferings and insisted that they should get him a celebrated doctor from moscow to all inquiries made of him as to how he felt he made the same answer with an expression of vindictive reproachfulness suffering horribly intolerably the sick man was suffering more and more especially from bedsores which it was impossible now to remedy and grew more and more angry with everyone about him blaming them for everything and especially for not having brought him a doctor from moscow kitty tried in every possible way to relieve him to soothe him but it was all in vain and levin saw that she herself was exhausted both physically and morally though she would not admit it the sense of death which had been evoked in all by his taking leave of life on the night when he had sent for his brother was broken up everyone knew that he must inevitably die soon that he was already everyone wished for nothing but that he should die as soon as possible and everyone concealing this gave him medicines tried to find remedies and doctors and deceived him and themselves and one another all this was falsehood disgusting irreverent deceit and owing to the bent of his character and because he loved the dying man more than anyone else did levin was most painfully conscious of this deceit 
 levin who had long been possessed by the idea of reconciling his brothers at least in face of death had written to his brother sergei ivanovich and having received an answer from him he read this letter to the sick man sergei ivanovich wrote that he could not come himself and in touching terms he begged his forgiveness 
 the sick man said nothing 
 what am i to write to him said levin i hope you are not angry with him 
 no not in the least nikolai answered vexed at the question tell him to send me a doctor 
 three more days of agony followed the sick man was still in the same condition the sense of longing for his death was felt by everyone now who saw him by the waiters and the hotelkeeper and all the people staying in the hotel and the doctor and marya nikolaevna and levin and kitty the sick man alone did not express this feeling but on the contrary was furious at their not getting him doctors and went on taking medicine and talking of life only at rare moments when the opium gave him an relief from his pain he would sometimes utter what was ever more intense in his heart than in all the others oh if it were only the end or when will it be over 
 his sufferings steadily growing more intense did their work and prepared him for death there was no position in which he was not in pain there was not a minute in which he was unconscious of it not a limb not a part of his body that did not ache and cause him agony even the memories the impressions the thoughts of this body awakened in him now the same aversion as the body itself the sight of other people their remarks his own reminiscences everything was for him a source of agony those about him felt this and instinctively did not allow themselves to move freely to talk to express their wishes before him all his life was merged in the one feeling of suffering and desire to be rid of it 
 there was evidently coming over him that revulsion which would make him look upon death as the goal of his desires as happiness hitherto each individual desire aroused by suffering or privation such as hunger fatigue thirst had been satisfied by some bodily function giving pleasure but now no physical craving or suffering received relief and the effort to relieve them only caused fresh suffering and so all desires were merged in one the desire to be rid of all his sufferings and their source the body but he had no words to express this desire of deliverance and so he did not speak of it and from habit asked for the satisfaction of desires which could not now be satisfied turn me over on the other side he would say and immediately after he would ask to be turned back again as before give me some broth take away the broth talk of something why are you silent and directly they began to talk he would close his eyes and would show weariness indifference and loathing 
 on the tenth day from their arrival in the town kitty was unwell she suffered from headache and sickness and she could not get up all the morning 
 the doctor opined that the indisposition arose from fatigue and excitement and prescribed rest 
 after dinner however kitty got up and went as with her work to the sick man he looked at her sternly when she came in and smiled contemptuously when she said she had been unwell that day he was continually blowing his nose and groaning piteously 
 how do you feel she asked him 
 worse he articulated with difficulty in pain 
 in pain where 
 everywhere 
 it will be over today you will see said marya nikolaevna though it was said in a whisper the sick man whose hearing levin had noticed was very keen must have heard levin said hush to her and looked round at the sick man nikolai had heard but these words produced no effect on him his eyes had still the same intense reproachful look 
 why do you think so levin asked her when she had followed him into the corridor 
 he has begun picking at himself said marya nikolaevna 
 how do you mean 
 like this she said tugging at the folds of her woolen skirt levin noticed indeed that all that day the patient pulled at himself as it were trying to snatch something away 
 marya prediction came true toward night the sick man was not able to lift his hands and could only gaze before him with the same intensely concentrated expression in his eyes even when his brother or kitty bent over him so that he could see them he looked just the same kitty sent for the priest to read the prayer for the dying 
 while the priest was reading it the dying man did not show any sign of life his eyes were closed levin kitty and marya nikolaevna stood at the bedside the priest had not quite finished reading the prayer when the dying man stretched sighed and opened his eyes the priest on finishing the prayer put the cross to the cold forehead then slowly returned it to the stand and after standing in silence for two minutes more he touched the huge bloodless hand that was turning cold 
 he is gone said the priest and would have moved away but suddenly there was a faint stir in the mustaches of the dead man that seemed glued together and quite distinctly in the hush they heard from the bottom of the chest the sharply defined sounds 
 not quite soon 
 and a minute later the face brightened a smile came out under the mustaches and the women who had gathered round began carefully laying out the corpse 
 the sight of his brother and the nearness of death revived in levin that sense of horror in the face of the insolvable enigma together with the nearness and inevitability of death that had come upon him that autumn evening when his brother had come to him this feeling was now even stronger than before even less than before did he feel capable of apprehending the meaning of death and its inevitability rose up before him more terrible than ever but now thanks to his presence that feeling did not reduce him to despair in spite of death he felt the need of life and love he felt that love saved him from despair and that his love under the menace of despair had become still stronger and purer 
 the one mystery of death still unsolved had scarcely passed before his eyes when another mystery had arisen as insoluble urging him to love and to life 
 the doctor confirmed his former suppositions in regard to kitty her indisposition consisted of pregnancy

 without referring to what he had believed in half an hour before as though ashamed even to recall it he asked for iodine to inhale in a bottle covered with perforated paper levin gave him the bottle and the same look of passionate hope with which he had taken the sacrament was now fastened on his brother demanding from him the confirmation of the words that inhaling iodine worked wonders 
 katia here he gasped looking round while levin reluctantly assented to the words no then i can say it it was for her sake i went through that farce so sweet but you and i deceive ourselves this is what i believe in he said and squeezing the bottle in his bony hand he began breathing over it 
 at eight in the evening levin and his wife were drinking tea in their room when marya nikolaevna ran in to them breathlessly she was pale and her lips were quivering he is dying she whispered afraid he will die right away 
 both of them ran to him he was sitting raised up with one elbow on the bed his long back bent and his head hanging low 
 how do you feel levin asked in a whisper after a silence 
 i feel setting off nikolai said with difficulty but with extreme distinctness deliberately squeezing the words out of himself he did not raise his head but simply turned his eyes upward without their reaching his face katia go away he added 
 levin jumped up and with a peremptory whisper made her go out 
 setting off he said again 
 why do you think so said levin so as to say something 
 because setting off he repeated as though he had a liking for the phrase the end 
 marya nikolaevna went up to him 
 you had better lie down be easier she said 
 i shall lie down soon enough he pronounced slowly when dead he said sarcastically wrathfully well you can put me down if you like 
 levin laid his brother on his back sat down beside him and gazed at his face holding his breath the dying man lay with closed eyes but the muscles twitched from time to time on his forehead as with one thinking deeply and intensely levin involuntarily thought with him of what it was that was happening to him now but in spite of all his mental efforts to keep him company he saw by the expression of that calm stern face and by the playing muscle above his brow that for the dying man there was growing clearer and clearer all that was still as dark as ever for levin 
 yes yes so the dying man articulated slowly at intervals wait a little he was silent again right he pronounced all at once reassuringly as though all were solved for him o lord he murmured and sighed deeply 
 marya nikolaevna felt his feet getting cold she whispered 
 for a long while a very long while it seemed to levin the sick man lay motionless but he was still alive and from time to time he sighed levin by now was exhausted from mental strain he felt that with no mental effort could he understand what it was that was right he felt that he could not follow the dying thinking he could not even think of the problem of death itself but with no will of his own thoughts kept coming to him of what he had to do next closing the dead eyes dressing him ordering the coffin and strange to say he felt utterly cold and was not conscious of sorrow nor of loss less still of pity for his brother if he had any feeling for his brother at that moment it was rather envy for the knowledge the dying man had now which he could not have 
 a long time more he sat over him so continually expecting the end but the end did not come the door opened and kitty appeared levin got up to stop her but at the moment he was getting up he caught the sound of the dying man stirring 
 go away said nikolai and held out his hand levin gave him his and angrily waved to his wife to go away 
 with the dying hand in his hand he sat for half an hour an hour another hour he did not think of death at all now he wondered what kitty was doing who lived in the next room whether the doctor lived in a house of his own he longed for food and for sleep he cautiously drew away his hand and felt the feet the feet were cold but the sick man was still breathing levin tried once more to move away on tiptoe but the sick man stirred again and said go 
 the dawn came the sick condition was unchanged levin stealthily withdrew his hand and without looking at the dying man went off to his own room and went to sleep when he woke up instead of news of his death which he expected he learned that the sick man had returned to his earlier condition he had begun sitting up again coughing had begun eating again talking again and again had ceased to talk of death again had begun to express hope of his recovery and had become more irritable and gloomier than ever no one neither his brother nor kitty could soothe him he was angry with everyone and said nasty things to everyone reproached everyone for his sufferings and insisted that they should get him a celebrated doctor from moscow to all inquiries made of him as to how he felt he made the same answer with an expression of vindictive reproachfulness suffering horribly intolerably the sick man was suffering more and more especially from bedsores which it was impossible now to remedy and grew more and more angry with everyone about him blaming them for everything and especially for not having brought him a doctor from moscow kitty tried in every possible way to relieve him to soothe him but it was all in vain and levin saw that she herself was exhausted both physically and morally though she would not admit it the sense of death which had been evoked in all by his taking leave of life on the night when he had sent for his brother was broken up everyone knew that he must inevitably die soon that he was already everyone wished for nothing but that he should die as soon as possible and everyone concealing this gave him medicines tried to find remedies and doctors and deceived him and themselves and one another all this was falsehood disgusting irreverent deceit and owing to the bent of his character and because he loved the dying man more than anyone else did levin was most painfully conscious of this deceit 
 levin who had long been possessed by the idea of reconciling his brothers at least in face of death had written to his brother sergei ivanovich and having received an answer from him he read this letter to the sick man sergei ivanovich wrote that he could not come himself and in touching terms he begged his forgiveness 
 the sick man said nothing 
 what am i to write to him said levin i hope you are not angry with him 
 no not in the least nikolai answered vexed at the question tell him to send me a doctor 
 three more days of agony followed the sick man was still in the same condition the sense of longing for his death was felt by everyone now who saw him by the waiters and the hotelkeeper and all the people staying in the hotel and the doctor and marya nikolaevna and levin and kitty the sick man alone did not express this feeling but on the contrary was furious at their not getting him doctors and went on taking medicine and talking of life only at rare moments when the opium gave him an relief from his pain he would sometimes utter what was ever more intense in his heart than in all the others oh if it were only the end or when will it be over 
 his sufferings steadily growing more intense did their work and prepared him for death there was no position in which he was not in pain there was not a minute in which he was unconscious of it not a limb not a part of his body that did not ache and cause him agony even the memories the impressions the thoughts of this body awakened in him now the same aversion as the body itself the sight of other people their remarks his own reminiscences everything was for him a source of agony those about him felt this and instinctively did not allow themselves to move freely to talk to express their wishes before him all his life was merged in the one feeling of suffering and desire to be rid of it 
 there was evidently coming over him that revulsion which would make him look upon death as the goal of his desires as happiness hitherto each individual desire aroused by suffering or privation such as hunger fatigue thirst had been satisfied by some bodily function giving pleasure but now no physical craving or suffering received relief and the effort to relieve them only caused fresh suffering and so all desires were merged in one the desire to be rid of all his sufferings and their source the body but he had no words to express this desire of deliverance and so he did not speak of it and from habit asked for the satisfaction of desires which could not now be satisfied turn me over on the other side he would say and immediately after he would ask to be turned back again as before give me some broth take away the broth talk of something why are you silent and directly they began to talk he would close his eyes and would show weariness indifference and loathing 
 on the tenth day from their arrival in the town kitty was unwell she suffered from headache and sickness and she could not get up all the morning 
 the doctor opined that the indisposition arose from fatigue and excitement and prescribed rest 
 after dinner however kitty got up and went as with her work to the sick man he looked at her sternly when she came in and smiled contemptuously when she said she had been unwell that day he was continually blowing his nose and groaning piteously 
 how do you feel she asked him 
 worse he articulated with difficulty in pain 
 in pain where 
 everywhere 
 it will be over today you will see said marya nikolaevna though it was said in a whisper the sick man whose hearing levin had noticed was very keen must have heard levin said hush to her and looked round at the sick man nikolai had heard but these words produced no effect on him his eyes had still the same intense reproachful look 
 why do you think so levin asked her when she had followed him into the corridor 
 he has begun picking at himself said marya nikolaevna 
 how do you mean 
 like this she said tugging at the folds of her woolen skirt levin noticed indeed that all that day the patient pulled at himself as it were trying to snatch something away 
 marya prediction came true toward night the sick man was not able to lift his hands and could only gaze before him with the same intensely concentrated expression in his eyes even when his brother or kitty bent over him so that he could see them he looked just the same kitty sent for the priest to read the prayer for the dying 
 while the priest was reading it the dying man did not show any sign of life his eyes were closed levin kitty and marya nikolaevna stood at the bedside the priest had not quite finished reading the prayer when the dying man stretched sighed and opened his eyes the priest on finishing the prayer put the cross to the cold forehead then slowly returned it to the stand and after standing in silence for two minutes more he touched the huge bloodless hand that was turning cold 
 he is gone said the priest and would have moved away but suddenly there was a faint stir in the mustaches of the dead man that seemed glued together and quite distinctly in the hush they heard from the bottom of the chest the sharply defined sounds 
 not quite soon 
 and a minute later the face brightened a smile came out under the mustaches and the women who had gathered round began carefully laying out the corpse 
 the sight of his brother and the nearness of death revived in levin that sense of horror in the face of the insolvable enigma together with the nearness and inevitability of death that had come upon him that autumn evening when his brother had come to him this feeling was now even stronger than before even less than before did he feel capable of apprehending the meaning of death and its inevitability rose up before him more terrible than ever but now thanks to his presence that feeling did not reduce him to despair in spite of death he felt the need of life and love he felt that love saved him from despair and that his love under the menace of despair had become still stronger and purer 
 the one mystery of death still unsolved had scarcely passed before his eyes when another mystery had arisen as insoluble urging him to love and to life 
 the doctor confirmed his former suppositions in regard to kitty her indisposition consisted of pregnancy

 from the moment when alexei alexandrovich understood from his interviews with betsy and with stepan arkadyevich that all that was expected of him was to leave his wife in peace without burdening her with his presence and that his wife herself desired this he felt so distraught that he could come to no decision by himself he did not know himself what he wanted now and putting himself in the hands of those who were so pleased to interest themselves in his affairs he met everything with unqualified assent it was only when anna had left his house and the english governess sent to ask him whether she should dine with him or separately that for the first time he clearly comprehended his position and was appalled by it 
 most difficult of all in this position was the fact that he could not in any way connect and reconcile his past with the present it was not the past when he had lived happily with his wife that troubled him the transition from that past to a knowledge of his unfaithfulness he had already lived through miserably that state had been painful but he could understand it if his wife had then on declaring to him her unfaithfulness left him he would have been wounded unhappy but he would not have been in the hopeless position incomprehensible to himself in which he felt himself now he could not now reconcile his immediate past his tenderness his love for his sick wife and for the other child with what was now the case with the fact that seemingly in return for all this he now found himself alone put to shame a laughingstock needed by no one and despised by everyone 
 for the first two days after his departure alexei alexandrovich received petitioners and his head clerk drove to the committee and went down to dinner in the dining room as usual without giving himself a reason for what he was doing he strained every nerve of his being for those two days simply to preserve an appearance of composure and even of indifference answering inquiries about the disposition of anna rooms and belongings he had exercised immense to appear like a man in whose eyes what had occurred was not unforeseen nor out of the ordinary course of events and he attained his aim no one could have detected in him any signs of despair but on the second day after her departure when kornei gave him a bill from a fashionable shop which anna had forgotten to pay and announced that the shopman was waiting alexei alexandrovich told him to show the man up 
 excuse me your excellency for venturing to trouble you but if you direct us to apply to her excellency would you graciously oblige us with her address 
 alexei alexandrovich pondered as it seemed to the shopman and all at once turning round he sat down to the table burying his head in his hands he sat for a long while in that position made several attempts to speak and stopped short 
 kornei perceiving his emotion asked the shopman to call another time left alone alexei alexandrovich realized that he had not the strength to keep up the role of firmness and composure any longer he gave orders for the carriage that was awaiting him to be taken back and for no one to be admitted and he did not go down to dinner 
 he felt that he could not endure the weight of universal contempt and exasperation which he had distinctly seen in the faces of the shopman and of kornei and of everyone without exception whom he had met during these two days he felt that he could not turn aside from himself the hatred of men because that hatred did not come from his being bad in that case he could have tried to be better but from his being shamefully and repulsively unhappy he knew that for this for the very fact that his heart was torn with grief they would be merciless to him he felt that men would crush him as dogs strangle a mangled dog yelping with pain he knew that his sole means of security against people was to hide his wounds from them and instinctively he tried to do this for two days but now he felt incapable of keeping up the unequal struggle 
 his despair was even intensified by the consciousness that he was utterly alone in his sorrow in all peterburg there was not a human being to whom he could express what he was feeling who would feel for him not as a high official not as a member of society but simply as a suffering man indeed he had not such a one in the whole world

 alexei alexandrovich had forgotten the countess lidia ivanovna but she had not forgotten him at the bitterest moment of his lonely despair she came to him and without waiting to be announced walked straight into his study she found him as he was sitting with his head in both hands 
 forc la consigne she said walking in with rapid steps and breathing hard with excitement and rapid exertion i have heard all alexei alexandrovich dear friend she went on warmly squeezing his hand in both of hers and gazing with her fine pensive eyes into his 
 alexei alexandrovich frowning got up and disengaging his hand moved a chair up for her 
 you sit down countess seeing no one because unwell countess he said and his lips twitched 
 dear friend repeated countess lidia ivanovna never taking her eyes off his and suddenly her eyebrows rose at the inner corners describing a triangle on her forehead her ugly yellow face becoming still uglier but alexei alexandrovich felt that she was sorry for him and was preparing to cry and he too was softened he snatched her plump hand and proceeded to kiss it 
 dear friend she said in a voice breaking with emotion you ought not to give way to grief your sorrow is a great one but you ought to find consolation 
 i am crushed i am annihilated i am no longer a man said alexei alexandrovich letting go her hand but still gazing into her brimming eyes my position is so awful because i can find nowhere i cannot find within me strength to support me 
 you will find support seek it not in me though i beseech you to believe in my friendship she said with a sigh our support is love that love that he has vouchsafed us his burden is light she said with the look of ecstasy alexei alexandrovich knew so well he will be your support and your succor 
 although there was in these words a flavor of that sentimental emotion at her own lofty feelings and that new mystical fervor which had lately gained ground in peterburg and which seemed to alexei alexandrovich disproportionate still it was pleasant to him to hear this now 
 i am weak i am crushed i foresaw nothing and now i understand nothing 
 dear friend repeated lidia ivanovna 
 not the loss of what i no longer have not that pursued alexei alexandrovich i do not grieve for that but i cannot help feeling ashamed before other people for the position i am placed in it is wrong but i help it i help it 
 it was not you who performed that noble act of forgiveness at which i was moved to ecstasy and everyone else too but he working within your heart said countess lidia ivanovna raising her eyes rapturously and so you cannot be ashamed of your act 
 alexei alexandrovich knit his brows and crooking his hands he cracked his fingers 
 one must know all the details he said in his high voice a strength has its limits countess and i have reached my limits the whole day i have had to be making arrangements arrangements about household matters arising he emphasized the word arising from my new solitary position the servants the governess the accounts these pinpricks have stabbed me to the heart and i have not the strength to bear it at dinner yesterday i was almost getting up from the dinner table i could not bear the way my son looked at me he did not ask me the meaning of it all but he wanted to ask and i could not bear the look in his eyes he was afraid to look at me but that is not all alexei alexandrovich would have referred to the bill that had been brought him but his voice shook and he stopped that bill on blue paper for a hat and ribbons he could not recall without a rush of 
 i understand dear friend said lidia ivanovna i understand it all succor and comfort you will find not in me though i have come only to aid you if i can if i could take from off you all these petty humiliating cares i understand that a word a superintendence is needed you will intrust it to me 
 silently and gratefully alexei alexandrovich squeezed her hand 
 together we will take care of seriozha practical affairs are not my strong point but i will set to work i will be your housekeeper thank me i do it not from myself 
 i cannot help thanking you 
 but dear friend do not give way to the feeling of which you spoke being ashamed of what is the highest glory he who humbles himself shall be exalted and you cannot thank me you must thank him and pray to him for succor in him alone we find peace consolation salvation and love she said and turning her eyes heavenward she began praying as alexei alexandrovich gathered from her silence 
 alexei alexandrovich listened to her now and those expressions which had seemed to him if not distasteful at least exaggerated now seemed to him natural and consolatory alexei alexandrovich had disliked this new enthusiastic fervor he was a believer who was interested in religion primarily in its political aspect and the new doctrine which ventured upon several new interpretations just because it paved the way to discussion and analysis was in principle disagreeable to him he had hitherto taken up a cold and even antagonistic attitude to this new doctrine and with countess lidia ivanovna who had been carried away by it he had never argued but by silence had assiduously parried her attempts to provoke him into argument now for the first time he heard her words with pleasure and did not inwardly oppose them 
 i am very very grateful to you both for your deeds and for your words he said when she had finished praying 
 countess lidia ivanovna once more squeezed both of her hands 
 now i will enter upon my duties she said with a smile after a pause as she wiped away the traces of tears i am going to seriozha only in the last extremity shall i apply to you and she got up and went out 
 countess lidia ivanovna went into part of the house and dropping tears on the scared cheeks she told him that his father was a saint and his mother was dead 
 countess lidia ivanovna kept her promise she did actually take upon herself the care of the organization and management of alexei household but she had not overstated the case when saying that practical affairs were not her strong point all her arrangements had to be modified because they could not be carried out and they were modified by kornei alexei valet who though no one was aware of the fact now managed household and quietly and discreetly reported to his master while the latter was dressing all it was necessary for him to know but lidia help was none the less real she gave alexei alexandrovich moral support in the consciousness of her love and respect for him and still more as it was soothing to her to believe by having almost turned him to christianity that is from an indifferent and apathetic believer she had turned him into an ardent and steadfast adherent of the new interpretation of christian doctrine which had been gaining ground of late in peterburg it was easy for alexei alexandrovich to believe in this teaching alexei alexandrovich like lidia ivanovna indeed and others who shared their views was completely devoid of profundity of imagination that spiritual faculty in virtue of which the ideas evoked by the imagination become so actual that they must needs be in harmony with other ideas and with reality itself he saw nothing impossible and absurd in the idea that death though existing for unbelievers did not exist for him and that as he was possessed of the most perfect faith of the measure of which he was himself the judge there was therefore no sin in his soul and he was experiencing complete salvation here on earth 
 it is true that the erroneousness and shallowness of this conception of his faith was dimly perceptible to alexei alexandrovich and he knew that when without the slightest idea that his forgiveness was the action of a higher power he had surrendered directly to the feeling of forgiveness he had felt more happiness than now when he was thinking every instant that christ was in his heart and that in signing official papers he was doing his will but for alexei alexandrovich it was a necessity to think in that way it was such a necessity for him in his humiliation to have some elevated standpoint however imaginary from which looked down upon by all he could look down on others that he clung as to his one salvation to his delusion of salvation

 i am weak i am crushed i foresaw nothing and now i understand nothing 
 dear friend repeated lidia ivanovna 
 not the loss of what i no longer have not that pursued alexei alexandrovich i do not grieve for that but i cannot help feeling ashamed before other people for the position i am placed in it is wrong but i help it i help it 
 it was not you who performed that noble act of forgiveness at which i was moved to ecstasy and everyone else too but he working within your heart said countess lidia ivanovna raising her eyes rapturously and so you cannot be ashamed of your act 
 alexei alexandrovich knit his brows and crooking his hands he cracked his fingers 
 one must know all the details he said in his high voice a strength has its limits countess and i have reached my limits the whole day i have had to be making arrangements arrangements about household matters arising he emphasized the word arising from my new solitary position the servants the governess the accounts these pinpricks have stabbed me to the heart and i have not the strength to bear it at dinner yesterday i was almost getting up from the dinner table i could not bear the way my son looked at me he did not ask me the meaning of it all but he wanted to ask and i could not bear the look in his eyes he was afraid to look at me but that is not all alexei alexandrovich would have referred to the bill that had been brought him but his voice shook and he stopped that bill on blue paper for a hat and ribbons he could not recall without a rush of 
 i understand dear friend said lidia ivanovna i understand it all succor and comfort you will find not in me though i have come only to aid you if i can if i could take from off you all these petty humiliating cares i understand that a word a superintendence is needed you will intrust it to me 
 silently and gratefully alexei alexandrovich squeezed her hand 
 together we will take care of seriozha practical affairs are not my strong point but i will set to work i will be your housekeeper thank me i do it not from myself 
 i cannot help thanking you 
 but dear friend do not give way to the feeling of which you spoke being ashamed of what is the highest glory he who humbles himself shall be exalted and you cannot thank me you must thank him and pray to him for succor in him alone we find peace consolation salvation and love she said and turning her eyes heavenward she began praying as alexei alexandrovich gathered from her silence 
 alexei alexandrovich listened to her now and those expressions which had seemed to him if not distasteful at least exaggerated now seemed to him natural and consolatory alexei alexandrovich had disliked this new enthusiastic fervor he was a believer who was interested in religion primarily in its political aspect and the new doctrine which ventured upon several new interpretations just because it paved the way to discussion and analysis was in principle disagreeable to him he had hitherto taken up a cold and even antagonistic attitude to this new doctrine and with countess lidia ivanovna who had been carried away by it he had never argued but by silence had assiduously parried her attempts to provoke him into argument now for the first time he heard her words with pleasure and did not inwardly oppose them 
 i am very very grateful to you both for your deeds and for your words he said when she had finished praying 
 countess lidia ivanovna once more squeezed both of her hands 
 now i will enter upon my duties she said with a smile after a pause as she wiped away the traces of tears i am going to seriozha only in the last extremity shall i apply to you and she got up and went out 
 countess lidia ivanovna went into part of the house and dropping tears on the scared cheeks she told him that his father was a saint and his mother was dead 
 countess lidia ivanovna kept her promise she did actually take upon herself the care of the organization and management of alexei household but she had not overstated the case when saying that practical affairs were not her strong point all her arrangements had to be modified because they could not be carried out and they were modified by kornei alexei valet who though no one was aware of the fact now managed household and quietly and discreetly reported to his master while the latter was dressing all it was necessary for him to know but lidia help was none the less real she gave alexei alexandrovich moral support in the consciousness of her love and respect for him and still more as it was soothing to her to believe by having almost turned him to christianity that is from an indifferent and apathetic believer she had turned him into an ardent and steadfast adherent of the new interpretation of christian doctrine which had been gaining ground of late in peterburg it was easy for alexei alexandrovich to believe in this teaching alexei alexandrovich like lidia ivanovna indeed and others who shared their views was completely devoid of profundity of imagination that spiritual faculty in virtue of which the ideas evoked by the imagination become so actual that they must needs be in harmony with other ideas and with reality itself he saw nothing impossible and absurd in the idea that death though existing for unbelievers did not exist for him and that as he was possessed of the most perfect faith of the measure of which he was himself the judge there was therefore no sin in his soul and he was experiencing complete salvation here on earth 
 it is true that the erroneousness and shallowness of this conception of his faith was dimly perceptible to alexei alexandrovich and he knew that when without the slightest idea that his forgiveness was the action of a higher power he had surrendered directly to the feeling of forgiveness he had felt more happiness than now when he was thinking every instant that christ was in his heart and that in signing official papers he was doing his will but for alexei alexandrovich it was a necessity to think in that way it was such a necessity for him in his humiliation to have some elevated standpoint however imaginary from which looked down upon by all he could look down on others that he clung as to his one salvation to his delusion of salvation

 the countess lidia ivanovna had as a very young and enthusiastic girl been married to a wealthy man of high rank a very jovial and extremely dissipated rake one month after marriage her husband abandoned her and her enthusiastic protestations of affection he met with an irony and even hostility which people knowing the good heart and seeing no defects in the enthusiastic lidia were at a loss to explain though they were divorced and lived apart yet whenever the husband met the wife he invariably behaved to her with the same malignant irony the cause of which was incomprehensible 
 countess lidia ivanovna had long given up being in love with her husband but from that time she had never given up being in love with someone she was in love with several people at once both men and women she had been in love with almost everyone who had been particularly distinguished in any way she was in love with all the new princes and princesses who married into the imperial family she had been in love with one archbishop one vicar and one parish priest she had been in love with one journalist three slavophils with komissarov with one minister one doctor one english missionary and karenin all these passions constantly waning or growing more ardent did not prevent her from keeping up the most extended and complicated relations with the court and fashionable society but from the time that after trouble she had taken him under special protection from the time that she had set to work in household looking after his welfare she felt that all her other attachments were not the real thing and that she was now genuinely in love and with no one but karenin the feeling she now experienced for him seemed to her stronger than any of her former feelings analyzing her feeling and comparing it with former passions she distinctly perceived that she would not have been in love with komissarov if he had not saved the life of the czar that she would not have been in love with if there had been no slavonic question but that she loved karenin for himself for his lofty uncomprehended soul for the sweet to her high notes of his voice for his drawling intonation his weary eyes his character and his soft white hands with their swollen veins she was not simply overjoyed at meeting him but she sought in his face signs of the impression she was making on him she tried to please him not by her words only but in her whole person for his sake it was that she now lavished more care on her dress than before she caught herself in reveries on what might have been if she had not been married and he had been free she blushed with emotion when he came into the room she could not repress a smile of rapture when he said anything amiable to her 
 for several days now countess lidia ivanovna had been in a state of intense excitement she had learned that anna and vronsky were in peterburg alexei alexandrovich must be saved from seeing her he must be saved even from the torturing knowledge that that awful woman was in the same town with him and that he might meet her any minute 
 lidia ivanovna made inquiries through her friends as to what those shocking people as she called anna and vronsky intended doing and she endeavored so to guide every movement of her friend during those days that he might not come across them the young adjutant a friend of vronsky through whom she obtained her information and who hoped through countess lidia ivanovna to obtain a concession told her that they had finished their business and were going away next day lidia ivanovna had already begun to calm down when the next morning a note was brought her the handwriting of which she recognized with horror it was the handwriting of anna karenina the envelope was of paper as thick as bast on the oblong yellow paper there was a huge monogram and the letter smelt of agreeable scent 
 who brought it 
 a commissionaire from the hotel 
 it was some time before countess lidia ivanovna could sit down to read the letter her excitement brought on an attack of asthma to which she was subject when she had recovered her composure she read the following letter in french 
 madame la comtesse the christian feelings with which your heart is filled give me the i feel unpardonable boldness to write to you i am miserable at being separated from my son i entreat permission to see him once before my departure forgive me for recalling myself to your memory i apply to you and not to alexei alexandrovich simply because i do not wish to cause that generous man to suffer in remembering me knowing your friendship for him i know you will understand me could you send seriozha to me or should i come to the house at some fixed hour or will you let me know when and where i could see him away from home i do not anticipate a refusal knowing the magnanimity of him with whom it rests you cannot conceive the craving i have to see him and so cannot conceive the gratitude your help will arouse in me 
 
 anna 
 everything in this letter exasperated countess lidia ivanovna its contents and the allusion to magnanimity and especially its free and easy as she considered tone 
 say that there is no answer said countess lidia ivanovna and immediately opening her blotting book she wrote to alexei alexandrovich that she hoped to see him at one at the levee 
 i must talk with you of a grave and painful subject there we will arrange where to meet best of all at my house where i will order tea as you like it urgent he lays the cross but he gives the strength to bear it she added so as to give him some slight preparation 
 countess lidia ivanovna usually wrote some two or three letters a day to alexei alexandrovich she enjoyed that form of communication which gave opportunity for a refinement and air of mystery not afforded by their personal interviews

 the levee was drawing to a close people met as they were going away and gossiped of the latest news of the newly bestowed honors and the changes in the positions of the higher functionaries 
 if only countess marya borissovna were minister of war and princess vatkovsky were commander in chief said a little old man in a uniform addressing a tall handsome maid of honor who had questioned him about the new appointments 
 and if i were one of the adjutants said the maid of honor smiling 
 you have an appointment already over the ecclesiastical department and your karenin 
 good day prince said the little old man to a man who came up to him 
 what were you saying of karenin said the prince 
 he and putiatov have received the order of alexandre nevsky 
 i thought he had it already 
 no just look at him said the little old man pointing with his embroidered hat to karenin in a court uniform with the new red ribbon across his shoulders standing in the doorway of the hall with an influential member of the imperial council pleased and happy as brass he added stopping to shake hands with a handsome gentleman of the bedchamber of colossal proportions 
 no looking older said the gentleman of the bedchamber 
 from overwork always drawing up projects nowadays he let a poor devil go nowadays till explained it all to him under heads 
 looking older did you say il fait des passions i believe countess lidia jealous now of his wife 
 oh come now please say any harm of countess lidia ivanovna 
 why is there any harm in her being in love with karenin 
 but is it true madame here 
 well not here in the palace but in peterburg i met her yesterday with alexei vronsky bras dessus bras dessous on the morskaia 
 un homme qui pas the gentleman of the bedchamber was beginning but he stopped to make room bowing for a member of the imperial family to pass 
 thus people talked incessantly of alexei alexandrovich finding fault with him and laughing at him while he blocking up the way of the member of the imperial council he had captured was explaining to him point by point his new financial project never interrupting his discourse for an instant for fear he should escape 
 almost at the same time that his wife left alexei alexandrovich there had come to him that bitterest moment in the life of an official the moment when his upward career comes to a full stop this full stop had arrived and everyone perceived it but alexei alexandrovich himself was not yet aware that his career was over whether it was due to his feud with stremov or his misfortune with his wife or simply that alexei alexandrovich had reached his predestined limits it had become evident to everyone in the course of that year that his career was at an end he still filled a position of consequence he sat on many commissions and committees but he was a man whose day was over and from whom nothing was expected whatever he said whatever he proposed was heard as though it were something long familiar and the very thing that was not needed but alexei alexandrovich was not aware of this and on the contrary being cut off from direct participation in governmental activity he saw more clearly than ever the errors and defects in the action of others and thought it his duty to point out means for their correction shortly after his separation from his wife he began writing his first note on the new judicial procedure the first of the endless series of notes he was destined to write in the future 
 alexei alexandrovich did not merely fail to observe his hopeless position in the official world he was not merely free from anxiety on this head he was positively more satisfied than ever with his own activity 
 he that is married careth for the things of the world how he may please his wife he that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the lord how he may please the lord says the apostle paul and alexei alexandrovich who was now guided in every action by scripture often recalled this text it seemed to him that ever since he had been left without a wife he had in these very projects of reform been serving the lord more zealously than ever 
 the unmistakable impatience of the member of the council trying to get away from him did not trouble alexei alexandrovich he gave up his exposition only when the member of the council seizing his chance when one of the imperial family was passing slipped away from him 
 left alone alexei alexandrovich looked down collecting his thoughts then looked casually about him and walked toward the door where he hoped to meet countess lidia ivanovna 
 and how strong they all are how sound physically thought alexei alexandrovich looking at the powerfully built gentleman of the bedchamber with his perfumed whiskers and at the red neck of the prince pinched by his tight uniform he had to pass them on his way truly is it said that all the world is evil he thought with another sidelong glance at the calves of the gentleman of the bedchamber 
 moving forward deliberately alexei alexandrovich bowed with his customary air of weariness and dignity to the gentleman who had been talking about him and looking toward the door his eyes sought countess lidia ivanovna 
 ah alexei alexandrovich said the little old man with a malicious light in his eyes at the moment when karenin had come up to them and was nodding with a frigid gesture i congratulated you yet said the old man pointing to his newly received ribbon 
 thank you answered alexei alexandrovich what an exquisite day today he added laying emphasis in his peculiar way on the word exquisite 
 that they laughed at him he was well aware but he did not expect anything but hostility from them he was used to that by now 
 catching sight of the yellow shoulders of lidia ivanovna jutting out above her corset and her fine pensive eyes summoning him to her alexei alexandrovich smiled revealing untarnished white teeth and went toward her 
 lidia dress had cost her great pains as indeed all her dresses had done of late her aim in dress was now quite the reverse of what she had pursued thirty years before then her desire had been to adorn herself with something and the more adorned the better now on the contrary she was perforce decked out in a way so inconsistent with her age and her figure that her one anxiety was to contrive that the contrast between these adornments and her own exterior should not be too appalling and as far as alexei alexandrovich was concerned she succeeded and was in his eyes attractive for him she was the one island not only of good will to him but of love in the midst of the sea of hostility and jeering that surrounded him 
 passing through rows of ironical eyes he was drawn as naturally to her loving glance as a plant to the sun 
 i congratulate you she said to him her eyes on his ribbon 
 suppressing a smile of pleasure he shrugged his shoulders closing his eyes as though to say that that could not be a source of joy to him countess lidia ivanovna was very well aware that it was one of his chief sources of satisfaction though he never admitted it 
 how is our angel said countess lidia ivanovna meaning seriozha 
 i say i was quite pleased with him said alexei alexandrovich raising his eyebrows and opening his eyes and sitnikov is not satisfied with him sitnikov was the tutor to whom secular education had been intrusted as i have mentioned to you a sort of coldness in him toward the most important questions which ought to touch the heart of every man and every child alexei alexandrovich began expounding his views on the sole question that interested him outside the service the education of his son 
 when alexei alexandrovich with lidia help had been brought back anew to life and activity he felt it his duty to undertake the education of the son left on his hands having never before taken any interest in educational questions alexei alexandrovich devoted some time to the theoretical study of the subject after reading several books on anthropology education and didactics alexei alexandrovich drew up a plan of education and engaging the best tutor in peterburg to superintend it he set to work and the subject continually absorbed him 
 yes but the heart i see in him his heart and with such a heart a child cannot go far wrong said lidia ivanovna with enthusiasm 
 yes perhaps as for me i do my duty all i can do 
 coming to me said countess lidia ivanovna after a pause we have to speak of a subject painful for you i would give anything to have spared you certain memories but others are not of the same mind i have received a letter from her she is here in peterburg 
 alexei alexandrovich shuddered at the allusion to his wife but immediately his face assumed the deathlike rigidity which expressed utter helplessness in the matter 
 i was expecting it he said 
 countess lidia ivanovna looked at him ecstatically and tears of rapture at the greatness of his soul came into her eyes

 when alexei alexandrovich came into the countess lidia snug little boudoir decorated with old china and hung with portraits the lady herself had not yet made her appearance 
 she was changing her dress 
 a cloth was laid on a round table and on it stood a china tea service and a silver teakettle and spirit lamp alexei alexandrovich looked idly about at the endless familiar portraits which adorned the room and sitting down to the table he opened a new testament lying upon it the rustle of the silk skirt drew his attention off 
 well now we can sit quietly said countess lidia ivanovna slipping hurriedly with an agitated smile between the table and the sofa and talk over our tea 
 after some words of preparation countess lidia ivanovna breathing hard and flushing crimson gave into alexei hands the letter she had received 
 after reading the letter he sat a long while in silence 
 i think i have the right to refuse her he said timidly lifting his eyes 
 dear friend you never see evil in anyone 
 on the contrary i see that all is evil but whether it is just 
 his face showed irresolution and a seeking for counsel support and guidance in a matter he did not understand 
 no countess lidia ivanovna interrupted him there are limits to everything i can understand immorality she said not quite truthfully since she never could understand that which leads women to immorality but i understand cruelty to whom to you how can she stay in the town where you are no the longer one lives the more one learns and learning to understand your loftiness and her baseness 
 who is to cast a stone said alexei alexandrovich unmistakably pleased with the part he had to play i have forgiven all and so i cannot deprive her of what is exacted by love in her by her love for her son 
 but is that love my friend is it sincere admitting that you have forgiven that you forgive have we the right to work on the soul of that angel he looks on her as dead he prays for her and beseeches god to have mercy on her sins and it is better so but now what will he think 
 i had not thought of that said alexei alexandrovich evidently agreeing 
 countess lidia ivanovna hid her face in her hands and was silent she was praying 
 if you ask my advice she said having finished her prayer and uncovered her face i do not advise you to do this do you suppose i see how you are suffering how this has torn open your wounds but supposing that as always you think of yourself what can it lead to to fresh suffering for you to torture for the child if there were a trace of humanity left in her she ought not to wish it herself no i have no hesitation in saying i advise against it and if you will intrust it to me i will write to her 
 and alexei alexandrovich consented and countess lidia ivanovna sent the following letter in french 
 dear madame to be reminded of you might result in your asking questions which could not be answered without implanting in the soul a spirit of censure toward what should be for him sacred and therefore i beg you to interpret your refusal in the spirit of christian love i pray to almighty god to have mercy on you 
 
 countess lidia 
 this letter attained the secret object which countess lidia ivanovna had concealed from herself it wounded anna to the quick 
 for his part alexei alexandrovich on returning home from lidia could not all that day concentrate himself on his usual pursuits and find that spiritual peace of one saved and believing which he had felt of late 
 the thought of his wife who had so greatly sinned against him and toward whom he had been so saintly as countess lidia ivanovna had so justly told him ought not to have troubled him but he was not easy he could not understand the book he was reading he could not drive away harassing recollections of his relations with her of the mistake which as it now seemed he had made in regard to her the memory of how he had received her confession of infidelity on their way home from the races especially his having insisted only on the observance of external decorum and not having sent a challenge tortured him like a remorse he was tortured too by the thought of the letter he had written her and most of all his forgiveness which nobody wanted and his care of the other child seared his heart with shame and remorse 
 and just the same feeling of shame and remorse he felt now as he reviewed all his past with her recalling the awkward words in which after long wavering he proposed to her 
 but how have i been to blame he said to himself and this question always excited another question in him whether they felt differently did their loving and marrying differently these vronskys and oblonskys these gentlemen of the bedchamber with their fine calves and there passed before his mind a whole series of these succulent vigorous men who always and everywhere drew his inquisitive attention in spite of himself he tried to dispel these thoughts he tried to persuade himself that he was not living for this transient life but for the life of eternity and that there was peace and love in his heart but the fact that he had in this transient trivial life made as it seemed to him a few trivial mistakes tortured him as though the eternal salvation in which he believed had no existence but this temptation did not last long and soon there was reestablished once more in alexei soul the peace and the loftiness by virtue of which he could forget what he did not want to remember

 when alexei alexandrovich came into the countess lidia snug little boudoir decorated with old china and hung with portraits the lady herself had not yet made her appearance 
 she was changing her dress 
 a cloth was laid on a round table and on it stood a china tea service and a silver teakettle and spirit lamp alexei alexandrovich looked idly about at the endless familiar portraits which adorned the room and sitting down to the table he opened a new testament lying upon it the rustle of the silk skirt drew his attention off 
 well now we can sit quietly said countess lidia ivanovna slipping hurriedly with an agitated smile between the table and the sofa and talk over our tea 
 after some words of preparation countess lidia ivanovna breathing hard and flushing crimson gave into alexei hands the letter she had received 
 after reading the letter he sat a long while in silence 
 i think i have the right to refuse her he said timidly lifting his eyes 
 dear friend you never see evil in anyone 
 on the contrary i see that all is evil but whether it is just 
 his face showed irresolution and a seeking for counsel support and guidance in a matter he did not understand 
 no countess lidia ivanovna interrupted him there are limits to everything i can understand immorality she said not quite truthfully since she never could understand that which leads women to immorality but i understand cruelty to whom to you how can she stay in the town where you are no the longer one lives the more one learns and learning to understand your loftiness and her baseness

 chapter 
 
 well kapitonich said seriozha coming back rosy and from his walk the day before his birthday and giving his russian plaited overcoat to the tall old hall porter who smiled down at the little person from the height of his long figure well has the bandaged official been here today did papa see him 
 he saw him the minute the head clerk came out i announced him said the hall porter with a wink here take it off 
 seriozha said his slavonic tutor stopping in the doorway leading to the inner rooms take it off yourself but seriozha though he heard the feeble voice did not pay attention to it he stood keeping hold of the hall shoulder knot and gazing into his face 
 well and did papa do what he wanted for him 
 the hall porter nodded his head affirmatively 
 the bandaged official who had already been seven times to ask some favor of alexei alexandrovich interested both seriozha and the hall porter seriozha had come upon him in the hall and had heard him plaintively beg the hall porter to announce him saying that he and his children had death staring them in the face 
 since then seriozha having met him a second time in the hall took great interest in him 
 well was he very glad he asked 
 glad i should think so almost dancing as he walked away 
 and has anything been left for me asked seriozha after a pause 
 come sir said the hall porter then with a shake of his head he whispered something from the countess 
 seriozha understood at once that what the hall porter was speaking of was a present from countess lidia ivanovna for his birthday 
 you say where 
 kornei took it to your papa a fine plaything it must be too 
 how big like this 
 rather small but a fine thing 
 a book 
 else run along run along vassilii lukich is calling you said the porter hearing the steps approaching and carefully taking away from his shoulder knot the little hand in the glove off he indicated with his head lukich the tutor 
 vassilii lukich coming in one tiny minute answered seriozha with gay and loving smile which always won over the careful vassilii lukich 
 seriozha was too happy everything was too delightful for him to be able to help sharing with his friend the porter the family good fortune of which he had heard from lidia niece during his walk in the public gardens this piece of good news seemed to him particularly important from its coming at the same time with the joy of the bandaged official and his own joy at toys having come for him it seemed to seriozha that this was a day on which everyone ought to be glad and happy 
 you know received the order of alexandre nevsky today 
 to be sure i do people have already been here to congratulate him 
 and is he glad 
 glad at the gracious favor i should think so a proof deserved it said the porter sternly and seriously 
 seriozha fell to musing gazing up at the face of the porter which he had thoroughly studied in every detail especially at his chin which hung down between the gray whiskers never seen by anyone but seriozha who saw him only from below 
 well and has your daughter been to see you lately 
 the daughter was a ballet dancer 
 when is she to come on weekdays their lessons to learn too and your lesson sir run along 
 on coming into the room seriozha instead of sitting down to his lessons told his tutor of his supposition that what had been brought him must be a toy railway what do you think he inquired 
 but vassilii lukich was thinking of nothing but the necessity of learning the grammar lesson for the teacher who was coming at two 
 no do just tell me vassilii lukich he asked suddenly when he was seated at their worktable with the book in his hands what is greater than the alexandre nevsky you know received the alexandre nevsky 
 vassilii lukich replied that the vladimir was greater than the alexandre nevsky 
 and higher still 
 well highest of all is the andrei pervozvanny 
 and higher than the andrei 
 i know 
 what you know and seriozha leaning on his elbows sank into deep meditation 
 his meditations were of the most complex and diverse character he imagined his having been suddenly presented with both the vladimir and the andrei today and in consequence being much better tempered at his lesson and dreamed how when he was grown up he would himself receive all the orders and what might be invented higher than the andrei directly any higher order were invented he would win it they would make a higher one still and he would immediately win that too 
 the time passed in such meditations and when the teacher came the lesson about the adverbs of place and time and manner of action was not ready and the teacher was not only displeased but hurt this touched seriozha he felt he was not to blame for not having learned the lesson however much he tried he was utterly unable to do it as long as the teacher was explaining to him he believed him and seemed to comprehend but as soon as he was left alone he was positively unable to recollect and to understand that the short and familiar word suddenly is an adverb of manner of action still he was sorry that he had disappointed the teacher and he was anxious to comfort him 
 he chose a moment when the teacher was looking in silence at the book 
 mikhail ivanich when is your birthday he asked all of a sudden 
 much better be thinking about your work birthdays are of no importance to a rational being a day like any other on which one has to do work 
 seriozha looked intently at the teacher at his scanty beard at his spectacles which had slipped down below the ridge on his nose and fell into so deep a reverie that he heard nothing of what the teacher was explaining to him he knew that the teacher did not think what he had said he felt it from the tone in which it was said but why have they all agreed to speak just in the same manner always the dreariest and most useless stuff why does he keep me off why he love me he asked himself mournfully and could not think of an answer

 chapter 
 
 after the lesson with the teacher of grammar came his lesson while waiting for his father seriozha sat at the table playing with a penknife and fell to musing among favorite occupations was searching for his mother during his walks he did not believe in death generally and in her death in particular in spite of what lidia ivanovna had told him and his father had confirmed and it was just because of that and after he had been told she was dead that he had begun looking for her when out for a walk every woman of full graceful figure with dark hair was his mother at the sight of such a woman such a feeling of tenderness stirred within him that his breath failed him and tears came into his eyes and he was on tiptoe with expectation that she would come up to him would lift her veil all her face would be visible she would smile she would hug him he would sniff her fragrance feel the softness of her arms and cry with happiness just as he had one evening lain on her lap while she tickled him and he laughed and bit her white fingers later when he accidentally learned from his old nurse that his mother was not dead and his father and lidia ivanovna had explained to him that she was dead to him because she was wicked which he could not possibly believe because he loved her he went on seeking her and expecting her in the same way that day in the public gardens there had been a lady in a lilac veil whom he had watched with a throbbing heart believing it to be her as she came toward them along the path the lady had not come up to them but had disappeared somewhere that day more intensely than ever seriozha felt a rush of love for her and now waiting for his father he forgot everything and cut all round the edge of the table with his penknife staring straight before him with sparkling eyes and thinking of her 
 here is your papa vassilii lukich diverted him 
 seriozha jumped up and went up to his father and kissing his hand looked at him intently trying to discover signs of his joy at receiving the alexandre nevsky 
 did you have a good walk said alexei alexandrovich sitting down in his easy chair pulling the volume of the old testament to him and opening it although alexei alexandrovich had more than once told seriozha that every christian ought to know scripture history thoroughly he often referred to the bible himself during the lesson and seriozha observed this 
 yes it was very good indeed papa said seriozha sitting sideways on his chair and rocking it which was forbidden i saw nadinka nadinka was a niece of lidia who was being brought up in her house she told me been given a new star are you glad papa 
 first of all rock your chair please said alexei alexandrovich and secondly not the reward precious but the work itself and i could have wished you had understood that if you now are going to work to study in order to win a reward then the work will seem hard to you but when you work alexei alexandrovich as he spoke thought of how he had been sustained by a sense of duty through the wearisome labor of the morning consisting of signing one hundred and eighty papers loving your work you will find your reward for it 
 eyes hitherto shining with gaiety and tenderness grew dull and dropped before his gaze this was the same tone his father always took with him and seriozha had learned by now to fall in with it his father always talked to him so seriozha felt as though he were addressing some boy of his own imagination one of those boys who exist in books utterly unlike himself and seriozha always tried before his father to pretend being this storybook boy 
 you understand that i hope said his father 
 yes papa answered seriozha acting the part of the imaginary boy 
 the lesson consisted of learning by heart several verses out of the evangel and the repetition of the beginning of the old testament the verses from the evangel seriozha knew fairly well but at the moment when he was saying them he became so absorbed in watching the sharply protruding bony knobbiness of his forehead that he lost the thread and he transposed the end of one verse and the beginning of another it was evident to alexei alexandrovich that he did not understand what he was saying and this irritated him 
 he frowned and began explaining what seriozha had heard many times before and never could remember because he understood it too well just as that suddenly is an adverb of manner of action seriozha looked with scared eyes at his father and could think of nothing but whether his father would make him repeat what he had said as he sometimes did and this thought so alarmed seriozha that he now understood nothing but his father did not make him repeat it and passed on to the lesson out of the old testament seriozha recounted the events themselves well enough but when he had to answer questions as to what certain events prefigured he knew nothing though he had already been punished over this lesson the passage at which he was utterly unable to say anything and began fidgeting and cutting the table and swinging his chair was where he had to tell of the patriarchs before the flood he did not know one of them except enoch who had been taken up alive to heaven last time he had remembered their names but now he had forgotten them utterly chiefly because enoch was the personage he liked best in the whole of the old testament and translation to heaven was connected in his mind with a whole long train of thought in which he became absorbed now while he gazed with fascinated eyes at his watch chain and a button on his waistcoat 
 in death of which they talked to him so often seriozha disbelieved entirely he did not believe that those he loved could die above all that he himself would die that was to him something utterly inconceivable and impossible but he had been told all men die he had asked people indeed whom he trusted and they too had confirmed it his old nurse too said the same though reluctantly but enoch had not died and so it followed that everyone did not die and why cannot anyone else so serve god and be taken alive to heaven thought seriozha bad people that is those seriozha did not like might die but the good might all be like enoch 
 well what are the names of the patriarchs 
 enoch enos 
 but you have said that already this is bad seriozha very bad if you try to learn what is most necessary of all for a christian said his father getting up whatever can interest you i am displeased with you and piotr ignatich this was the chief pedagogue is displeased with you i shall have to punish you 
 his father and his teacher were both displeased with seriozha and he certainly did learn his lessons very badly but still it could not be said he was a stupid boy on the contrary he was far cleverer than the boys his teacher held up as examples to seriozha in his opinion he did not want to learn what he was taught in reality he could not learn that he could not because the claims of his own soul were more binding on him that those claims his father and his teacher made upon him those claims were in opposition and he was in direct conflict with his governors 
 he was nine years old he was a child but he knew his own soul it was precious to him he guarded it as the eyelid guards the eye and without the key of love he let no one into his soul his teachers complained that he would not learn while his soul was brimming over with thirst for knowledge and he learned from kapitonich from his nurse from nadinka from vassilii lukich but not from his teachers the spring his father and his teachers reckoned upon to turn their mill wheels had long oozed at another place and its waters did their work there 
 his father punished seriozha by not letting him go to see nadinka lidia niece but this punishment turned out happily for seriozha vassilii lukich was in a good humor and showed him how to make windmills the whole evening passed over this work and in dreaming how to make a windmill on which he could turn himself clutching at the wings or tying himself on and whirling round of his mother seriozha did not think all the evening but when he had gone to bed he suddenly remembered her and prayed in his own words that tomorrow his mother in time for his birthday might leave off hiding herself and come to him 
 vassilii lukich do you know what i prayed for tonight extra beside the regular things 
 that you might learn your lessons better 
 no 
 toys 
 no never guess a splendid thing but a secret when it comes to pass tell you you guess 
 no i guess you tell me said vassilii lukich with a smile which was rare with him come lie down putting out the candle 
 without the candle i can see better what i see and what i prayed for there i was almost telling the secret said seriozha laughing gaily 
 when the candle was taken away seriozha heard his mother and felt her presence she stood over him and her loving gaze caressed him but then came windmills a penknife everything became confused and he fell asleep

 his father and his teacher were both displeased with seriozha and he certainly did learn his lessons very badly but still it could not be said he was a stupid boy on the contrary he was far cleverer than the boys his teacher held up as examples to seriozha in his opinion he did not want to learn what he was taught in reality he could not learn that he could not because the claims of his own soul were more binding on him that those claims his father and his teacher made upon him those claims were in opposition and he was in direct conflict with his governors 
 he was nine years old he was a child but he knew his own soul it was precious to him he guarded it as the eyelid guards the eye and without the key of love he let no one into his soul his teachers complained that he would not learn while his soul was brimming over with thirst for knowledge and he learned from kapitonich from his nurse from nadinka from vassilii lukich but not from his teachers the spring his father and his teachers reckoned upon to turn their mill wheels had long oozed at another place and its waters did their work there 
 his father punished seriozha by not letting him go to see nadinka lidia niece but this punishment turned out happily for seriozha vassilii lukich was in a good humor and showed him how to make windmills the whole evening passed over this work and in dreaming how to make a windmill on which he could turn himself clutching at the wings or tying himself on and whirling round of his mother seriozha did not think all the evening but when he had gone to bed he suddenly remembered her and prayed in his own words that tomorrow his mother in time for his birthday might leave off hiding herself and come to him 
 vassilii lukich do you know what i prayed for tonight extra beside the regular things 
 that you might learn your lessons better 
 no 
 toys 
 no never guess a splendid thing but a secret when it comes to pass tell you you guess 
 no i guess you tell me said vassilii lukich with a smile which was rare with him come lie down putting out the candle 
 without the candle i can see better what i see and what i prayed for there i was almost telling the secret said seriozha laughing gaily 
 when the candle was taken away seriozha heard his mother and felt her presence she stood over him and her loving gaze caressed him but then came windmills a penknife everything became confused and he fell asleep

 on arriving in peterburg vronsky and anna stayed at one of the best hotels vronsky apart in a lower story anna above with her child its nurse and her maid in a large suite of four rooms 
 on the day of his arrival vronsky went to his there he found his mother who had come from moscow on business his mother and greeted him as usual they asked him about his stay abroad and talked of their common acquaintances but did not let drop a single word in allusion to his connection with anna his brother came next morning to see vronsky and of his own accord asked him about her and alexei vronsky told him directly that he looked upon his connection with madame karenina as marriage that he hoped to arrange a divorce and then to marry her and until then he considered her as much a wife as any other wife and he begged him to tell their mother and his wife so 
 if the world disapproves i care said vronsky but if my relations want to be on terms of relationship with me they will have to be on the same terms with my wife 
 the elder brother who had always a respect for his younger judgment could not well tell whether he was right or not till the world had decided the question for his part he had nothing against it and with alexei he went up to see anna 
 before his brother as before everyone vronsky addressed anna with a certain formality treating her as he might a very intimate friend but it was understood that his brother knew their real relations and they talked about going to estate 
 in spite of all his social experience vronsky was in consequence of the new position in which he was placed laboring under a strange misapprehension one would have thought he must have understood that society was closed for him and anna but now some vague ideas had sprung up in his brain that this was only the case in days and that now with the rapidity of modern progress he had unconsciously become by now a partisan of every sort of progress the views of society had changed and that the question of their reception by society was far from decided of course he thought she would not be received at court but intimate friends can and must look at it in the proper light 
 one may sit for several hours at a stretch with legs crossed in the same position if one knows that nothing to prevent changing position but if a man knows that he must remain sitting so with crossed legs then cramps come on the legs begin to twitch and to strain toward the spot to which one would like to draw them this was what vronsky was experiencing in regard to the world though at the bottom of his heart he knew that the world was shut on them he put it to the test whether the world had not changed by now and would not receive them but he very quickly perceived that though the world was open for him personally it was closed for anna just as in the game of cat and mouse the hands raised for him were dropped to bar the way for anna 
 one of the first ladies of peterburg society whom vronsky saw was his cousin betsy 
 at last she greeted him joyfully and anna how glad i am where are you stopping i can fancy after your delightful travels you must find our poor peterburg horrid i can fancy your honeymoon in rome how about the divorce is that all over 
 vronsky noticed that enthusiasm waned when she learned that no divorce had as yet taken place 
 people will cast a stone at me i know she said but i shall come and see anna yes i shall certainly come you be here long i suppose 
 and she did certainly come to see anna the same day but her tone was not at all the same as in former days she unmistakably prided herself on her courage and wished anna to appreciate the fidelity of her friendship she only stayed ten minutes talking of society news and on leaving she said 
 never told me when the divorce is to be supposing ready to fling my cap over the mill other starchy people will give you the cold shoulder until married and so simple nowadays ca se fait so going on friday sorry we see each other again 
 from tone vronsky might have grasped what he had to expect from the world but he made another effort in his own family his mother he did not reckon upon he knew that his mother who had been so enthusiastic over anna at their first acquaintance would have no mercy on her now for having ruined her career but he had more hope of varia his wife he fancied she would not cast a stone and would go simply and directly to see anna and would receive her in her own house 
 the day after his arrival vronsky went to her and finding her alone expressed his wishes directly 
 you know alexei she said after hearing him how fond i am of you and how ready i am to do anything for you but i have not spoken because i knew i could be of no use to you and to anna arkadyevna she said articulating the name anna arkadyevna with particular care suppose please that i judge her never perhaps in her place i should have done the same i and enter into that she said glancing timidly at his gloomy face but one must call things by their names you want me to go and see her to ask her here and to rehabilitate her in society but do understand that i cannot do so i have daughters growing up and i must live in the world for my sake well ready to come and see anna arkadyevna she will understand that i ask her here or i should have to do so in such a way that she would not meet people who look at things differently that would offend her i raise her 
 oh i regard her as having fallen more than hundreds of women you do receive vronsky interrupted her still more gloomily and he got up in silence understanding that his decision was not to be shaken 
 alexei be angry with me please understand that not to blame began varia looking at him with a timid smile 
 not angry with you he said still as gloomily but this is doubly painful to me sorry too that this means breaking up our friendship if not breaking up at least weakening it you will understand that for me too it cannot be otherwise 
 and with that he left her 
 vronsky knew that further efforts were useless and that he had to spend these few days in peterburg as though in a strange town avoiding every sort of relation with his own old circle in order not to be exposed to the annoyances and humiliations which were so intolerable to him one of the most unpleasant features of his position in peterburg was that alexei alexandrovich and his name seemed to meet him everywhere he could not begin to talk of anything without the conversation turning on alexei alexandrovich he could not go anywhere without risk of meeting him so at least it seemed to vronsky just as it seems to a man with a sore finger that he is continually as though on purpose grazing his sore finger against everything 
 their stay in peterburg was the more painful to vronsky because he perceived all the time a sort of new mood he could not understand in anna at one time she would seem in love with him and the next she would become cold irritable and impenetrable she was worrying over something and keeping something back from him and did not seem to notice the humiliations which poisoned his existence and which for her with her delicate intuition must have been still more unbearable

 one of objects in coming back to russia had been to see her son from the day she left italy the thought of seeing him had never ceased to agitate her and as she got nearer to peterburg the delight and importance of this meeting grew ever greater in her imagination she did not even put to herself the problem of how to arrange it it seemed to her natural and simple to see her son when she should be in the same town with him but on her arrival in peterburg she was suddenly made distinctly aware of her present position in society and she grasped the fact that to arrange this meeting was no easy matter 
 she had now been two days in peterburg the thought of her son never left her for a single instant but she had not yet seen him to go straight to the house where she might meet alexei alexandrovich that she felt she had no right to do she might be refused admittance and insulted to write and so enter into relations with her husband the thought of doing that made her miserable she could only be at peace when she did not think of her husband to get a glimpse of her son out walking finding out where and when he went out was not enough for her she had so looked forward to this meeting she had so much she must say to him she so longed to embrace him to kiss him old nurse might be a help to her and show her what to do but the nurse was not now living in alexei house in this uncertainty and in efforts to find the nurse two days had slipped by 
 hearing of the close intimacy between alexei alexandrovich and countess lidia ivanovna anna decided on the third day to write her a letter which cost her great pains and in which she intentionally said that permission to see her son must depend on her magnanimity she knew that if the letter were shown to her husband he would keep up his role of magnanimity and would not refuse her request 
 the commissionaire who took the letter had brought her back the most cruel and unexpected answer that there was no answer she had never felt so humiliated as at the moment when sending for commissionaire she heard from him the exact account of how he had waited and how afterward he had been told there was no answer anna felt humiliated insulted but she saw that from her point of view countess lidia ivanovna was right her suffering was the more poignant since she had to bear it in solitude she could not and would not share it with vronsky she knew that to him although he was the primary cause of her distress the question of her seeing her son would seem a matter of very little consequence she knew that he would never be capable of understanding all the depth of her suffering that for his cool tone at any allusion to it she would begin to hate him and she dreaded that more than anything in the world and so she hid from him everything that related to her son 
 spending the whole day at home she considered ways of seeing her son and had reached a decision to write to her husband she was just composing this letter when she was handed the letter from lidia ivanovna the silence had subdued and depressed her but the letter all that she read between the lines in it so exasperated her this malice was so revolting beside her passionate legitimate tenderness for her son that she turned against other people and left off blaming herself 
 this coldness is simulation of feeling she said to herself they must needs insult me and torture the child and i am to submit to it not on any consideration she is worse than i am i lie anyway and she decided on the spot that next day birthday she would go straight to her house bribe the servants deceive the people but at any cost see her son and overturn the hideous deception with which they were encompassing the unhappy child 
 she went to a toyshop bought toys and thought over a plan of action she would go early in the morning at eight when alexei alexandrovich would be certain not to be up she would have money in her hand to give the hall porter and the footman so that they should let her in and without raising her veil she would say that she had come from godfather to congratulate him and that she had been charged to leave the toys at his bedside she had prepared everything but the words she should say to her son often she dreamed of it she could never think of anything 
 the next day at eight in the morning anna got out of a hired coach and rang at the front entrance of her former home 
 run and see wanted some lady said kapitonich who not yet dressed in his overcoat and galoshes had peeped out of the window and seen a lady in a veil standing close up to the door his assistant a lad anna did not know had no sooner opened the door to her than she came in and pulling a note out of her muff put it hurriedly into his hand 
 seriozha sergei alexeich she said and was going on scrutinizing the note the assistant stopped her at the second glass door 
 whom do you want he asked 
 she did not hear his words and made no answer 
 noticing the embarrassment of the unknown lady kapitonich went out to her opened the second door for her and asked her what she was pleased to want 
 from prince skorodumov for sergei alexeich she said 
 not up yet said the porter looking at her attentively 
 anna had not anticipated that the absolutely unchanged hall of the house where she had lived for nine years would so greatly affect her memories sweet and painful rose one after another in her heart and for a moment she forgot what she was here for 
 would you kindly wait said kapitonich taking off her fur cloak 
 as he took off the cloak kapitonich glanced at her face recognized her and made her a low bow in silence 
 please walk in your excellency he said to her 
 she tried to say something but her voice refused to utter any sound with a guilty and imploring glance at the old man she went with light swift steps up the stairs bent double and his galoshes catching in the steps kapitonich ran after her trying to overtake her 
 the there maybe not dressed let him know 
 anna still mounted the familiar staircase not understanding what the old man was saying 
 this way to the left if you please excuse its not being tidy in the former smoking room now the hall porter said panting excuse me wait a little your excellency just see he said and overtaking her he opened the high door and disappeared behind it anna stood still waiting only just awake said the hall porter coming out 
 and at the very instant the porter said this anna caught the sound of a childish yawn from the sound of this yawn alone she knew her son and seemed to see him living before her eyes 
 let me in go away she said and went in through the high doorway on the right of the door stood a bed and sitting up in the bed was the boy his little body bent forward his nightshirt unbuttoned he was stretching and still yawning the instant his lips came together they curved into a blissfully sleepy smile and with that smile he slowly and deliciously rolled back again 
 seriozha she whispered walking noiselessly up to him 
 when she was parted from him and all this latter time when she had been feeling a fresh rush of love for him she had pictured him as he was at four years old when she had loved him most of all now he was not even the same as when she had left him he was farther than ever from the baby more grown and thinner how thin his face was how short his hair was what long hands how he had changed since she left him but it was he with his head his lips his soft neck and broad little shoulders 
 seriozha she repeated in the very ear 
 he raised himself again on his elbow turned his tousled head from side to side as though looking for something and opened his eyes quietly and inquiringly he looked for several seconds at his mother standing motionless before him then all at once he smiled a blissful smile and shutting his eyes again rolled not backward but toward her into her arms 
 seriozha my darling boy she said breathing hard and putting her arms around his plump little body 
 mother he said wriggling about in her arms so as to touch her hands with different parts of him 
 smiling sleepily still with closed eyes he flung his fat little arms round her shoulders rolled toward her with the delicious sleepy warmth and fragrance that is only found in children and began rubbing his face against her neck and shoulders 
 i knew he said opening his eyes my birthday today i knew come get up directly 
 and saying that he dropped asleep 
 anna looked at him hungrily she saw how he had grown and changed in her absence she knew and did not know the bare legs so long now that were thrust out below the quilt she knew those curls on his neck in which she had so often kissed him she touched all this and could say nothing tears choked her 
 what are you crying for mother he said waking up completely mother what are you crying for he cried in a tearful voice 
 i i cry crying for joy so long since seen you i i she said gulping down her tears and turning away come time for you to dress now she added after a pause and never letting go his hands she sat down by his bedside on the chair where his clothes were put ready for him 
 how do you dress without me how she made an attempt to talk simply and cheerfully but she could not and again she turned away 
 i have a cold bath papa order it and not seen vassilii lukich come in soon why sitting on my clothes 
 and seriozha went off into a peal of laughter she looked at him and smiled 
 mother darling sweet one he shouted flinging himself on her again and hugging her it was as if only now on seeing her smile he fully grasped what had happened i want that on he said taking off her hat and as it were seeing her afresh without her hat he fell to kissing her again 
 but what did you think about me you think i was dead 
 i never believed it 
 you believe it my sweet 
 i knew i knew he repeated his favorite phrase and snatching the hand that was stroking his hair he pressed the open palm to his mouth and kissed it

 go yet he come just yet 
 the mother held him away from her to see whether he was thinking what he said to her and in his frightened face she read not only that he was speaking of his father but as it were asking her what he ought to think about his father 
 seriozha my darling she said love him better and kinder than i am and i have done him wrong when you grow up you will judge 
 no one better than you he cried in despair through his tears and clutching her by the shoulders he began squeezing her with all his force to him his arms trembling with the strain 
 my sweet my little one said anna and she cried as weakly and childishly as he 
 at that moment the door opened vassilii lukich came in at the other door there was the sound of steps and the nurse in a scared whisper said coming and gave anna her hat 
 seriozha sank on the bed and sobbed hiding his face in his hands anna removed his hands once more kissed his wet face and with rapid steps went to the door alexei alexandrovich walked in meeting her seeing her he stopped short and bowed his head 
 although she had just said he was better and kinder than she in the rapid glance she flung at him taking in his whole figure in all its details feelings of repulsion and hatred for him and jealousy for her son took possession of her with a swift gesture she put down her veil and quickening her pace almost ran out of the room

 intensely as anna had longed to see her son and long as she had been thinking of it and preparing herself for it she had not in the least expected that seeing him would affect her so deeply on getting back to her lonely rooms in the hotel she could not for a long while understand why she was there yes all over and i am again alone she said to herself and without taking off her hat she sat down in a low chair by the hearth fixing her eyes on a bronze clock standing on a table between the windows she tried to think 
 the french maid brought from abroad came in to suggest she should dress she gazed at her wonderingly and said later on a footman offered her coffee later on she said 
 the italian nurse after taking the baby out in her best came in with her and brought her to anna the plump little baby on seeing her mother as she always did held out her chubby little hands and with a smile on her toothless mouth began like a fish with a float bobbing her fingers up and down the starched folds of her embroidered pinafore making them rustle it was impossible not to smile not to kiss the baby impossible not to hold out a finger for her to clutch crowing and prancing all over impossible not to offer her a lip which she sucked into her little mouth by way of a kiss and all this anna did and took her in her arms and made her dance and kissed her fresh little cheek and bare little elbows but at the sight of this child it was plainer than ever to her that the feeling she had for her could not be called love in comparison with what she felt for seriozha everything in this baby was charming but for some reason all this did not go deep to her heart on her first child though the child of an unloved father had been concentrated all the love that had never found satisfaction her baby girl had been born in the most painful circumstances and had not had a hundredth part of the care and thought which had been concentrated on her first child besides in the little girl everything was still in the future while seriozha was by now almost a personality and a personality dearly loved in him there was a conflict of thoughts and of feelings he understood her he loved her he judged her she thought recalling his words and his eyes and she was forever not physically only but spiritually divided from him and it was impossible to set this right 
 she gave the baby back to the nurse let her go and opened the locket in which there was portrait when he was almost of the same age as the girl she got up and taking off her hat took up from a little table an album in which there were photographs of her son at different ages she wanted to compare them and began taking them out of the album she took them all out except one the latest and best photograph in it he was in a white smock sitting astride a chair with frowning eyes and smiling lips it was his best most singular expression with her little supple hands her white delicate fingers that moved with a peculiar intensity today she pulled at a corner of the photograph but the photograph had caught somewhere and she could not get it out there was no paper knife on the table and pulling out the photograph that was next to her it was a photograph of vronsky taken at rome in a round hat and with long hair she used it to push out her photograph oh here he is she said glancing at the portrait of vronsky and she suddenly recalled that he was the cause of her present misery she had not once thought of him all the morning but now coming all at once upon that manly noble face so familiar and so dear to her she felt a sudden rush of love for him 
 but where is he how is it he leaves me alone in my misery she thought all at once with a feeling of reproach forgetting she had herself kept from him everything concerning her son she sent to ask him to come to her immediately with a throbbing heart she awaited him rehearsing to herself the words in which she would tell him all and the expressions of love with which he would console her the messenger returned with the answer that he had a visitor with him but that he would come immediately and that he asked whether she would let him bring with him prince iashvin who had just arrived in peterburg not coming alone and since dinner yesterday he has not seen me she thought not coming so that i could tell him everything but coming with iashvin and all at once a strange idea came to her what if he had ceased to love her 
 and going over the events of the last few days it seemed to her that she saw in everything a confirmation of this terrible idea the fact that he had not dined at home yesterday and the fact that he had insisted on their taking separate sets of rooms at peterburg and that even now he was not coming to her alone as though he were trying to avoid meeting her face to face 
 but he ought to tell me so i must know that it is so if i knew it then know what i should do she said to herself utterly unable to picture to herself the position she would be in if she were convinced of his not caring for her she thought he had ceased to love her she felt close upon despair and consequently she felt exceptionally alert she rang for her maid and went to her dressing room as she dressed she took more care over her appearance than she had done all these days as though he might if he had grown cold to her fall in love with her again because she had dressed and arranged her hair in the way most becoming to her 
 she heard the bell ring before she was ready 
 when she went into the drawing room it was not he but iashvin who met her eyes vronsky was looking through the photographs of her son which she had forgotten on the table and he made no haste to look round at her 
 we have met already she said putting her little hand into the huge hand of iashvin whose bashfulness was so queerly out of keeping with his immense frame and coarse face we met last year at the races give them to me she said with a rapid movement snatching from vronsky the photographs of her son and glancing significantly at him with flashing eyes were the races good this year instead of them i saw the races in the corso in rome but you care for life abroad she said with a cordial smile i know you and all your tastes though i have seen so little of you 
 awfully sorry for that for my tastes are mostly bad said iashvin gnawing at his left mustache 
 having talked a little while and noticing that vronsky glanced at the clock iashvin asked her whether she would be staying much longer in peterburg and unbending his huge figure reached after his cap 
 not long i think she said hesitatingly glancing at vronsky 
 so then we meet again said iashvin getting up and turning to vronsky where do you have your dinner 
 come and dine with me said anna resolutely angry it seemed with herself for her embarrassment but flushing as she always did when she defined her position before a fresh person the dinner here is not good but at least you will see him there is no one of his old friends in the regiment alexei cares for as he does for you 
 delighted said iashvin with a smile from which vronsky could see that he liked anna very much 
 iashvin said and went away vronsky stayed behind 
 are you going too she said to him 
 late already he answered run along catch up in a moment he called to iashvin 
 she took him by the hand and without taking her eyes off him gazed at him while she ransacked her mind for the words to say that would keep him 
 wait a minute something i want to say to you and taking his broad hand she pressed it on her neck oh was it right my asking him to dinner 
 you did quite right he said with a serene smile that showed his close teeth and he kissed her hand 
 alexei you have not changed to me she said pressing his hand in both of hers alexei i am miserable here when are we going away 
 soon soon you believe how disagreeable our way of living here is to me too he said and he drew away his hand 
 well go go she said offended and she walked quickly away from him

 when vronsky returned home anna was not yet home soon after he had left some lady so they told him had come to see her and she had gone out with her that she had gone out without leaving word where she was going that she had not yet come back and that all the morning she had been going about somewhere without a word to him all this together with the strange look of excitement in her face in the morning and the recollection of the hostile tone with which she had before iashvin almost snatched her photographs out of his hands made him serious he decided he absolutely must speak openly with her and he waited for her in her drawing room but anna did not return alone but brought with her her old unmarried aunt princess oblonskaia this was the lady who had come in the morning and with whom anna had gone out shopping anna appeared not to notice worried and inquiring expression and began a lively account of her shopping he saw that there was something working within her in her flashing eyes when they rested for a moment on him there was an intense concentration and in her words and movements there was that nervous rapidity and grace which during the early period of their intimacy had so fascinated him but which now so disturbed and alarmed him 
 the dinner was laid for four all were gathered together and about to go into the little dining room when tushkevich made his appearance with a message from princess betsy princess betsy begged her to excuse her not having come to say she had been indisposed but begged anna to come to her between six and eight vronsky glanced at anna at the precise limit of time so suggestive of steps having been taken that she should meet no one but anna appeared not to notice it 
 very sorry that i come just between six and nine she said with a faint smile 
 the princess will be very sorry 
 and so shall i 
 going no doubt to hear patti said tushkevich 
 patti you give me an idea i would go if it were possible to get a box 
 i can get one tushkevich offered his services 
 i should be very very grateful to you said anna but you dine with us 
 vronsky gave a hardly perceptible shrug he was at a complete loss to understand what anna was about what had she brought the old princess oblonskaia home for what had she made tushkevich stay to dinner for and most amazing of all why was she sending him for a box could she possibly think in her position of going to benefit where all the circle of her acquaintances would be he looked at her with serious eyes but she responded with that defiant look the meaning of which he could not comprehend at dinner anna was in aggressively high spirits she almost flirted both with tushkevich and with iashvin when they got up from dinner and tushkevich had gone to get a box at the opera iashvin went to smoke and vronsky went down with him to his own rooms after sitting there for some time he ran upstairs anna was already dressed in a gown of light silk and velvet that she had had made in paris and with costly white lace on her head framing her face and particularly becoming showing up her dazzling beauty 
 are you really going to the theater he said trying not to look at her 
 why do you ask with such alarm she said wounded again at his not looking at her why i go 
 she appeared not to understand the meaning of his words 
 oh of course no reason whatever he said frowning 
 just what i say she said willfully refusing to see the irony of his tone and quietly turning back her long perfumed glove 
 anna for sake what is the matter with you he said watching her exactly as once her husband had done 
 i understand what you are asking 
 you know that out of the question to go 
 why so not going alone princess varvara has gone to dress she is going with me 
 he shrugged his shoulders with an air of perplexity and despair 
 but do you mean to say you know he began 
 but i care to know she almost shrieked i care to do i regret what i have done no no no if it were all to do again from the beginning it would be the same for us for you and for me there is only one thing that matters whether we love each other other people we need not consider why are we living here apart and not seeing each other why i go i love you and i care for anything she said in russian glancing at him with a peculiar obscure for him gleam in her eyes if you have not changed to me why you look at me 
 he looked at her he saw all the beauty of her face and full dress always so becoming to her but now her beauty and elegance were just what irritated him 
 my feeling cannot change you know but i beg you i entreat you he said again in french with a note of tender supplication in his voice but with coldness in his eyes 
 she did not hear his words but she saw the coldness of his eyes and answered with irritation 
 and i beg you to explain why i should not go 
 because it might cause you he hesitated 
 i understand iashvin compromettant and princess varvara is no worse than others oh here she is

 chapter 
 
 when vronsky returned home anna was not yet home soon after he had left some lady so they told him had come to see her and she had gone out with her that she had gone out without leaving word where she was going that she had not yet come back and that all the morning she had been going about somewhere without a word to him all this together with the strange look of excitement in her face in the morning and the recollection of the hostile tone with which she had before iashvin almost snatched her photographs out of his hands made him serious he decided he absolutely must speak openly with her and he waited for her in her drawing room but anna did not return alone but brought with her her old unmarried aunt princess oblonskaia this was the lady who had come in the morning and with whom anna had gone out shopping anna appeared not to notice worried and inquiring expression and began a lively account of her shopping he saw that there was something working within her in her flashing eyes when they rested for a moment on him there was an intense concentration and in her words and movements there was that nervous rapidity and grace which during the early period of their intimacy had so fascinated him but which now so disturbed and alarmed him 
 the dinner was laid for four all were gathered together and about to go into the little dining room when tushkevich made his appearance with a message from princess betsy princess betsy begged her to excuse her not having come to say she had been indisposed but begged anna to come to her between six and eight vronsky glanced at anna at the precise limit of time so suggestive of steps having been taken that she should meet no one but anna appeared not to notice it

 i can get one tushkevich offered his services 
 i should be very very grateful to you said anna but you dine with us 
 vronsky gave a hardly perceptible shrug he was at a complete loss to understand what anna was about what had she brought the old princess oblonskaia home for what had she made tushkevich stay to dinner for and most amazing of all why was she sending him for a box could she possibly think in her position of going to benefit where all the circle of her acquaintances would be he looked at her with serious eyes but she responded with that defiant look the meaning of which he could not comprehend at dinner anna was in aggressively high spirits she almost flirted both with tushkevich and with iashvin when they got up from dinner and tushkevich had gone to get a box at the opera iashvin went to smoke and vronsky went down with him to his own rooms after sitting there for some time he ran upstairs anna was already dressed in a gown of light silk and velvet that she had had made in paris and with costly white lace on her head framing her face and particularly becoming showing up her dazzling beauty

 why do you ask with such alarm she said wounded again at his not looking at her why i go 
 she appeared not to understand the meaning of his words 
 oh of course no reason whatever he said frowning 
 just what i say she said willfully refusing to see the irony of his tone and quietly turning back her long perfumed glove 
 anna for sake what is the matter with you he said watching her exactly as once her husband had done 
 i understand what you are asking 
 you know that out of the question to go 
 why so not going alone princess varvara has gone to dress she is going with me 
 he shrugged his shoulders with an air of perplexity and despair 
 but do you mean to say you know he began 
 but i care to know she almost shrieked i care to do i regret what i have done no no no if it were all to do again from the beginning it would be the same for us for you and for me there is only one thing that matters whether we love each other other people we need not consider why are we living here apart and not seeing each other why i go i love you and i care for anything she said in russian glancing at him with a peculiar obscure for him gleam in her eyes if you have not changed to me why you look at me 
 he looked at her he saw all the beauty of her face and full dress always so becoming to her but now her beauty and elegance were just what irritated him 
 my feeling cannot change you know but i beg you i entreat you he said again in french with a note of tender supplication in his voice but with coldness in his eyes 
 she did not hear his words but she saw the coldness of his eyes and answered with irritation 
 and i beg you to explain why i should not go 
 because it might cause you he hesitated 
 i understand iashvin compromettant and princess varvara is no worse than others oh here she is

 chapter 
 
 vronsky for the first time experienced a feeling of anger against anna almost a hatred for her intentional refusal to understand her own position this feeling was aggravated by his being unable to tell her plainly the cause of his anger if he had told her directly what he was thinking he would have said in that dress with a princess only too well known to everyone to show yourself at the theater is equivalent not merely to acknowledging your position as a fallen woman but is flinging down a challenge to society that is to say cutting yourself off from it forever 
 he could not say that to her but how can she fail to see it and what is going on within her he said to himself he felt at the same time that his respect for her was diminished while his sense of her beauty was intensified 
 he went back scowling to his rooms and sitting down beside iashvin who with his long legs stretched out on a chair was drinking cognac and seltzer water he ordered a glass of the same for himself 
 you were talking of powerful a fine horse and i would advise you to buy him said iashvin glancing at his gloomy face his hindquarters quite but the legs and head one wish for anything better 
 i think i will take him answered vronsky 
 their conversation about horses interested him but he did not for an instant forget anna and could not help listening to the sound of steps in the corridor and looking at the clock on the chimney piece 
 anna arkadyevna gave orders to announce that she has gone to the theater 
 iashvin tipping another glass of cognac into the bubbling water drank it and got up buttoning his coat 
 well go he said faintly smiling under his mustache and showing by this smile that he knew the cause of gloominess and did not attach any significance to it 
 not going vronsky answered gloomily 
 well i must i promised to then if you do come to the stalls you can take stall added iashvin as he went out 
 no busy 
 a wife is a care but worse when not a wife thought iashvin as he walked out of the hotel 
 vronsky left alone got up from his chair and began pacing up and down the room 
 and today the fourth series iegor and his wife are there and my mother most likely of course all there now gone in taken off her cloak and come into the glare tushkevich iashvin princess varvara he pictured them to himself what about me either that frightened or have given up to tushkevich the right to protect her from every point of view stupid stupid and why is she putting me in such a position he said with a gesture of despair 
 with that gesture he knocked against the table on which there was standing the seltzer water and the decanter of cognac and almost upset it he tried to catch it let it slip and angrily kicked the table over and rang 
 if you care to be in my service he said to the valet who came in you had better remember your duties this be here you ought to have cleared away 
 the valet conscious of his own innocence would have defended himself but glancing at his master he saw from his face that the only thing to do was to be silent and hurriedly threading his way in and out dropped down on the carpet and began gathering up the whole and broken glasses and bottles 
 not your duty send the waiter to clear away and get my dress coat out 
 vronsky arrived at the theater at eight the performance was in full swing the little old boxkeeper recognizing vronsky as he helped him off with his fur coat called him your excellency and suggested he should not take a check but should simply call fiodor in the brightly lighted corridor there was no one but the box opener and two footmen with fur cloaks on their arms listening at the doors through the closed doors came the sounds of the discreet staccato accompaniment of the orchestra and a single female voice rendering distinctly a musical phrase the door opened to let the box opener slip through and the phrase drawing to the end reached hearing clearly but the doors were closed again at once and vronsky did not hear the end of the phrase and the cadence of the accompaniment though he knew from the thunder of applause that it was over when he entered the hall brilliantly lighted with chandeliers and gas jets the noise was still going on on the stage the singer bowing and smiling flashing with bare shoulders and with diamonds was with the help of the tenor who had given her his arm gathering up the bouquets that were clumsily flying over the footlights then she went up to a gentleman with glossy pomaded hair parted down the middle who was stretching across the footlights holding out something to her and all the public in the stalls as well as in the boxes was in excitement craning forward shouting and clapping the conductor in his high chair assisted in passing the offering and straightened his white tie vronsky walked into the middle of the stalls and standing still began looking about him that day less than ever was his attention turned upon the familiar habitual surroundings the stage the noise all the familiar uninteresting particolored herd of spectators in the packed theater 
 there were as always the same ladies of some sort with officers of some sort in the back of the boxes the same gaily dressed women god knows who and uniforms and black coats the same dirty crowd in the upper gallery and among the crowd in the boxes and in the front rows were some forty of the real people men and women and to those oases vronsky at once directed his attention and with them he entered at once into relation 
 the act was over when he went in and so he did not go straight to his box but going up to the first row of stalls stopped at the footlights with serpukhovskoy who standing with one knee raised and his heel on the footlights caught sight of him in the distance and beckoned to him smiling 
 vronsky had not yet seen anna he purposely avoided looking in her direction but he knew by the direction of eyes where she was he looked round discreetly but he was not seeking her expecting the worst his eyes sought for alexei alexandrovich to his relief alexei alexandrovich was not in the theater that evening 
 how little of the military man there is left in you serpukhovskoy was saying to him a diplomat an artist something of that sort one would say 
 yes it was like going back home when i put on a dress coat answered vronsky smiling and slowly taking out his opera glasses 
 well own i envy you there when i come back from abroad and put on this he touched his shoulder knot i regret my freedom 
 serpukhovskoy had long given up all hope of career but he liked him as before and was now particularly cordial to him 
 what a pity you were not in time for the first act 
 vronsky listening with half an ear moved his opera glasses from the stalls and scanned the boxes near a lady in a turban and a bald old man who seemed to blink angrily in the moving opera glasses vronsky suddenly caught sight of head proud strikingly beautiful and smiling in its frame of lace she was in the fifth box twenty paces from him she was sitting in front and slightly turning was saying something to iashvin the setting of her head on her handsome broad shoulders and the restrained excitement and brilliance of her eyes and her whole face reminded him of her just as he had seen her at the ball in moscow but he felt utterly different toward her beauty now in his feeling for her now there was no element of mystery and so her beauty though it attracted him even more intensely than before gave him now a sense of injury she was not looking in his direction but vronsky felt that she had seen him already 
 when vronsky turned the opera glasses again in that direction he noticed that princess varvara was particularly red and kept laughing unnaturally and looking round at the next box anna folding her fan and tapping it on the red velvet was gazing away and did not see and obviously did not wish to see what was taking place in the next box face wore the expression which was common when he was losing at cards scowling he sucked the left tip of his mustache further and further into his mouth and cast sidelong glances at the next box 
 in that box on the left were the kartassovs vronsky knew them and knew that anna was acquainted with them madame kartassova a thin little woman was standing up in her box and her back turned upon anna she was putting on a mantle that her husband was holding for her her face was pale and angry and she was talking excitedly kartassov a fat bald man was continually looking round at anna while he attempted to soothe his wife when the wife had gone out the husband lingered a long while and tried to catch eye obviously anxious to bow to her but anna with unmistakable intention avoided noticing him and talked to iashvin whose cropped head was bent down to her kartassov went out without making his salutation and the box was left empty 
 vronsky could not understand exactly what had passed between the kartassovs and anna but he saw that something humiliating for anna had happened he knew this both from what he had seen and most of all from the face of anna who he could see was taxing every nerve to carry through the part she had taken up and in maintaining this attitude of external composure she was completely successful anyone who did not know her and her circle who had not heard all the utterances of the women expressive of commiseration indignation and amazement that she should show herself in society and show herself so conspicuously with her lace and her beauty would have admired the serenity and loveliness of this woman without a suspicion that she was undergoing the sensations of a man in the stocks 
 knowing that something had happened but not knowing precisely what vronsky felt a thrill of agonizing anxiety and hoping to find out something he went toward his box purposely choosing the way round farthest from box he jostled as he came out against the colonel of his old regiment talking to two acquaintances vronsky heard the name of karenin and noticed how the colonel hastened to address vronsky loudly by name with a meaning glance at his companions 
 ah vronsky when are you coming to the regiment we let you off without a supper our one of the most thorough said the colonel of his regiment 
 i stop awfully sorry another time said vronsky and he ran upstairs toward his box 
 the old countess mother with her curls was in his box varia with the young princess sorokina met him in the corridor 
 leaving the princess sorokina with her mother varia held out her hand to her and began immediately to speak of what interested him she was more excited than he had ever seen her 
 i think mean and hateful and madame kartassova had no right to do it madame karenina she began 
 but what is it i know 
 what you heard 
 you know i should be the last person to hear of it 
 there a more spiteful creature than that madame kartassova 
 but what did she do 
 my husband told me she has insulted madame karenina her husband began talking to her across the box and madame kartassova made a scene she said something aloud they say something insulting and went away 
 count your maman is asking for you said the young princess sorokina peeping out of the door of the box 
 been expecting you all the while said his mother smiling sarcastically you were nowhere to be seen 
 her son saw that she could not suppress a smile of delight 
 good evening maman i have come to you he said coldly 
 why you going to faire la cour madame karenina she went on when princess sorokina had moved away elle fait sensation on oublie la patti pour elle 
 maman i have asked you not to say anything to me of that he answered scowling 
 only saying what saying 
 vronsky made no reply and saying a few words to princess sorokina he went away at the door he met his brother 
 ah alexei said his brother how disgusting idiot of a woman nothing else i wanted to go straight to her go together 
 vronsky did not hear him with rapid steps he went downstairs he felt that he must do something but he did not know what anger with her for having put herself and him in such a false position together with pity for her suffering filled his heart he went down and made straight for box at her box stood stremov talking to her 
 there are no more tenors le moule en est brise 
 vronsky bowed to her and stopped to greet stremov 
 you came in late i think and have missed the best song anna said to vronsky glancing ironically he thought at him 
 i am a poor judge of music he said looking sternly at her 
 like prince iashvin she said smiling who considers that patti sings too loud thank you she said her little hand in its long glove taking the playbill vronsky picked up and suddenly at that instant her lovely face quivered she got up and went into the interior of the box 
 noticing in the next act that her box was empty vronsky rousing many an indignant hush in the silent audience went out in the middle of a solo and drove home 
 anna was already at home when vronsky went up to her she was in the same dress she had worn at the theater she was sitting in the first armchair against the wall looking straight before her she looked at him and at once resumed her former position 
 anna he said 
 you you are to blame for everything she cried with tears of despair and hatred in her voice getting up 
 i begged i implored you not to go i knew it would be unpleasant 
 unpleasant she cried hideous as long as i live i shall never forget it she said it was a disgrace to sit beside me 
 a silly chatter he said but why risk it why provoke 
 i hate your calm you ought not to have brought me to this if you had loved me 
 anna how does the question of my love come in 
 oh if you loved me as i love if you were tortured as i am she said looking at him with an expression of terror 
 he was sorry for her and angry notwithstanding he assured her of his love because he saw that this was the only means of soothing her and he did not reproach her in words but in his heart he reproached her 
 and the asseverations of his love which seemed to him so trivial that he was ashamed to utter them she drank in eagerly and gradually became calmer the next day completely reconciled they left for the country

 of studies 
 studies serve for delight for ornament and for ability their chief use for delight 
 is in privateness and retiring for ornament is in discourse and for ability is in the judgement and disposition of business for expert men can execute and perhaps judge of particulars one by one but the general counsels and the plots and marshalling of affairs come best from those that are learned 
 to spend too much time in studies is sloth to use them too much for ornament is affectation to make judgement wholly by their rules is the humour of a scholar they perfect nature and are perfected by experience for natural abilities are like natural plants that need pruning by study and studies themselves do give forth directions too much at large except they be bounded in by experience 
 
 crafty men condemn studies simple men admire them and wise men use them for they teach not their own use but that is a wisdom without them and above them won by observation read not to contradict and confute nor to believe and take for granted nor to find talk and discourse but to weigh and consider some books are to be tasted others to be swallowed and some few to be chewed and digested that is some books are to be read only in parts others to be read but not curiously and some few to be read wholly and with diligence and attention 
 some books also may be read by deputy and extracts made of them by others but that would be only in the less important arguments and the meaner sort of book else distilled books are like common distilled waters flashy things reading maketh a full man conference a ready man and writing an exact man 
 and therefore if a man write little he had need have a great memory 
 if he confer lime he had need have a present wit and if he read little he had need 
 have much cunning to seem to know that he doth not histories make men wise poets witty the mathematics subtle natural philosophy deep moral grave 
 logic and rhetoric able to contend abeuntstucsa in mores nay there is no stond 
 or impediment in the wit but may be wrought out by fit studies like as diseases 
 of the body may have appropriate exercises bowling is good for the stone and reins shooting for the lungs and breast gentle walking for the stomach riding for the head and the like 
 so if a wit be wandering let him study the mathematics for in demonstrations if his wit be called away never so little he must begin again 
 if his wit be not apt to distinguish or find differences let him study the schoolmen 
 for they are cymnisectores if he be not apt to beat over matters and to call up 
 one thing to prove and illustrate another let him study the lawyers cases so every 
 defect of the mind may have a special receipt

 book descent 
 chapter x 
 
 result of the success 
 she had been dismissed towards the end of the winter the summer passed but winter came again 
 short days less work 
 winter 
 no warmth no light no noonday the evening joining on to the morning fogs twilight the window is gray it is impossible to see clearly at it 
 the sky is but a the whole day is a cavern 
 the sun has the air of a beggar 
 a frightful season winter changes the water of heaven and the heart of man into a stone her creditors harrassed her 
 fantine earned too little 
 her debts had increased 
 the thenardiers who were not promptly paid wrote to her constantly letters whose contents drove her to despair and whose carriage ruined her one day they wrote to her that her little cosette was entirely naked in that cold weather that she needed a woollen skirt and that her mother must send at least ten francs for this she received the letter and crushed it in her hands all day long that evening she went into a shop at the corner of the street and pulled out her comb 
 her admirable golden hair fell to her knees 
 what splendid hair exclaimed the barber 
 how much will you give me for it said she 
 ten francs 
 cut it off 
 she purchased a knitted petticoat and sent it to the thenardiers this petticoat made the thenardiers furious 
 it was the money that they wanted 
 they gave the petticoat to eponine 
 the poor lark continued to shiver 
 fantine thought 
 my child is no longer cold 
 i have clothed her with my hair 
 she put on little round caps which concealed her shorn head and in which she was still pretty 
 dark thoughts held possession of heart 
 when she saw that she could no longer dress her hair she began to hate every one about her 
 she had long shared the universal veneration for father madeleine yet by dint of repeating to herself that it was he who had discharged her that he was the cause of her unhappiness she came to hate him also and most of all when she passed the factory in working hours when the workpeople were at the door she affected to laugh and sing 
 an old workwoman who once saw her laughing and singing in this fashion said a girl who will come to a bad end 
 she took a lover the first who offered a man whom she did not love out of bravado and with rage in her heart 
 he was a miserable scamp a sort of mendicant musician a lazy beggar who beat her and who abandoned her as she had taken him in disgust 
 she adored her child 
 the lower she descended the darker everything grew about her the more radiant shone that little angel at the bottom of her heart she said when i get rich i will have my cosette with me and she laughed 
 her cough did not leave her and she had sweats on her back 
 one day she received from the thenardiers a letter couched in the following terms 
 cosette is ill with a malady which is going the rounds of the neighborhood 
 a miliary fever they call it expensive drugs are required 
 this is ruining us and we can no longer pay for them 
 if you do not send us forty francs before the week is out the little one will be dead 
 she burst out laughing and said to her old neighbor 
 ah they are good 
 forty francs the idea 
 that makes two napoleons where do they think i am to get them 
 these peasants are stupid truly 
 nevertheless she went to a dormer window in the staircase and read the letter once more 
 then she descended the stairs and emerged running and leaping and still laughing 
 some one met her and said to her what makes you so gay 
 she replied 
 a fine piece of stupidity that some country people have written to me 
 they demand forty francs of me 
 so much for you you peasants 
 as she crossed the square she saw a great many people collected around a carriage of eccentric shape upon the top of which stood a man dressed in red who was holding forth 
 he was a quack dentist on his rounds who was offering to the public full sets of teeth opiates powders and elixirs 
 fantine mingled in the group and began to laugh with the rest at the harangue which contained slang for the populace and jargon for respectable people 
 the espied the lovely laughing girl and suddenly exclaimed 
 you have beautiful teeth you girl there who are laughing if you want to sell me your palettes i will give you a gold napoleon apiece for them 
 what are my palettes asked fantine 
 the palettes replied the dental professor are the front teeth the two upper ones 
 how horrible exclaimed fantine 
 two napoleons grumbled a toothless old woman who was present a lucky girl 
 fantine fled and stopped her ears that she might not hear the hoarse voice of the man shouting to her 
 reflect my beauty two napoleons they may prove of service 
 if your heart bids you come this evening to the inn of the tillac you will find me there 
 fantine returned home 
 she was furious and related the occurrence to her good neighbor marguerite 
 can you understand such a thing is he not an abominable man 
 how can they allow such people to go about the country 
 pull out my two front teeth 
 why i should be horrible my hair will grow again but my teeth 
 ah what a monster of a man i should prefer to throw myself head first on the pavement from the fifth story 
 he told me that he should be at the tillac this evening 
 and what did he offer asked marguerite 
 two napoleons 
 that makes forty francs 
 yes said fantine that makes forty francs 
 she remained thoughtful and began her work 
 at the expiration of a quarter of an hour she left her sewing and went to read the thenardiers letter once more on the staircase 
 on her return she said to marguerite who was at work beside her 
 what is a miliary fever 
 do you know 
 yes answered the old spinster it is a disease 
 does it require many drugs 
 oh terrible drugs 
 how does one get it 
 it is a malady that one gets without knowing how 
 then it attacks children 
 children in particular 
 do people die of it 
 they may said marguerite 
 fantine left the room and went to read her letter once more on the staircase 
 that evening she went out and was seen to turn her steps in the direction of the rue de paris where the inns are situated 
 the next morning when marguerite entered room before they always worked together and in this manner used only one candle for the found fantine seated on her bed pale and frozen 
 she had not lain down her cap had fallen on her knees 
 her candle had burned all night and was almost entirely consumed 
 marguerite halted on the threshold petrified at this tremendous wastefulness and exclaimed 
 lord the candle is all burned out 
 something has happened 
 then she looked at fantine who turned toward her her head bereft of its hair 
 fantine had grown ten years older since the preceding night 
 jesus said marguerite what is the matter with you fantine 
 nothing replied fantine 
 quite the contrary 
 my child will not die of that frightful malady for lack of succor 
 i am content 
 so saying she pointed out to the spinster two napoleons which were glittering on the table 
 ah 
 jesus god cried marguerite 
 why it is a fortune where did you get those louis 
 i got them replied fantine 
 at the same time she smiled 
 the candle illuminated her countenance it was a bloody smile 
 a reddish saliva soiled the corners of her lips and she had a black hole in her mouth 
 the two teeth had been extracted 
 she sent the forty francs to montfermeil 
 after all it was a ruse of the thenardiers to obtain money cosette was not ill 
 fantine threw her mirror out of the window 
 she had long since quitted her cell on the second floor for an attic with only a latch to fasten it next the roof one of those attics whose extremity forms an angle with the floor and knocks you on the head every instant the poor occupant can reach the end of his chamber as he can the end of his destiny only by bending over more and more 
 she had no longer a bed a rag which she called her coverlet a mattress on the floor and a seatless chair still remained a little rosebush which she had had dried up forgotten in one corner in the other corner was a to hold water which froze in winter and in which the various levels of the water remained long marked by these circles of ice 
 she had lost her shame she lost her coquetry 
 a final sign 
 she went out with dirty caps whether from lack of time or from indifference she no longer mended her linen 
 as the heels wore out she dragged her stockings down into her shoes 
 this was evident from the perpendicular wrinkles she patched her bodice which was old and worn out with scraps of calico which tore at the slightest movement 
 the people to whom she was indebted made scenes and gave her no peace she found them in the street she found them again on her staircase she passed many a night weeping and thinking 
 her eyes were very bright and she felt a steady pain in her shoulder towards the top of the left she coughed a great deal she deeply hated father madeleine but made no complaint 
 she sewed seventeen hours a day but a contractor for the work of prisons who made the prisoners work at a discount suddenly made prices fall which reduced the daily earnings of to nine sous seventeen hours of toil and nine sous a day 
 her creditors were more pitiless than ever 
 the dealer who had taken back nearly all his furniture said to her incessantly when will you pay me you hussy 
 what did they want of her good god 
 she felt that she was being hunted and something of the wild beast developed in her about the same time thenardier wrote to her that he had waited with decidedly too much amiability and that he must have a hundred francs at once otherwise he would turn little cosette out of doors convalescent as she was from her heavy illness into the cold and the streets and that she might do what she liked with herself and die if she chose 
 a hundred francs thought fantine but in what trade can one earn a hundred sous a day 
 come said she let us sell what is left 
 the unfortunate girl became a woman of the town

 book three 
 chapter i 
 
 prince vasili was not a man who deliberately thought out his plans still less did he think of injuring anyone for his own advantage he was merely a man of the world who had got on and to whom getting on had become a habit schemes and devices for which he never rightly accounted to himself but which formed the whole interest of his life were constantly shaping themselves in his mind arising from the circumstances and persons he met of these plans he had not merely one or two in his head but dozens some only beginning to form themselves some approaching achievement and some in course of disintegration he did not for instance say to himself this man now has influence i must gain his confidence and friendship and through him obtain a special grant nor did he say to himself pierre is a rich man i must entice him to marry my daughter and lend me the forty thousand rubles i need but when he came across came across a man of position his instinct immediately told him that this man could be useful and without any premeditation prince vasili took the first opportunity to gain his confidence flatter him become intimate with him and finally make his request 
 he had pierre at hand in moscow and procured for him an appointment as gentleman of the bedchamber which at that time conferred the status of councilor of state and insisted on the young man accompanying him to petersburg and staying at his house with apparent yet with unhesitating assurance that he was doing the right thing prince vasili did everything to get pierre to marry his daughter had he thought out his plans beforehand he could not have been so natural and shown such unaffected familiarity in intercourse with everybody both above and below him in social standing something always drew him toward those richer and more powerful than himself and he had rare skill in seizing the most opportune moment for making use of people 
 pierre on unexpectedly becoming count bezukhov and a rich man felt himself after his recent loneliness and freedom from cares so beset and preoccupied that only in bed was he able to be by himself he had to sign papers to present himself at government offices the purpose of which was not clear to him to question his chief steward to visit his estate near moscow and to receive many people who formerly did not even wish to know of his existence but would now have been offended and grieved had he chosen not to see them these different people businessmen relations and acquaintances alike were all disposed to treat the young heir in the most friendly and flattering manner they were all evidently firmly convinced of noble qualities he was always hearing such words as with your remarkable kindness or with your excellent heart you are yourself so honorable count or were he as clever as you and so on till he began sincerely to believe in his own exceptional kindness and extraordinary intelligence the more so as in the depth of his heart it had always seemed to him that he really was very kind and intelligent even people who had formerly been spiteful toward him and evidently unfriendly now became gentle and affectionate the angry eldest princess with the long waist and hair plastered down like a had come into room after the funeral with drooping eyes and frequent blushes she told him she was very sorry about their past misunderstandings and did not now feel she had a right to ask him for anything except only for permission after the blow she had received to remain for a few weeks longer in the house she so loved and where she had sacrificed so much she could not refrain from weeping at these words touched that this statuesque princess could so change pierre took her hand and begged her forgiveness without knowing what for from that day the eldest princess quite changed toward pierre and began knitting a striped scarf for him 
 do this for my sake mon cher after all she had to put up with a great deal from the deceased said prince vasili to him handing him a deed to sign for the princess benefit 
 prince vasili had come to the conclusion that it was necessary to throw this bone a bill for thirty thousand rubles to the poor princess that it might not occur to her to speak of his share in the affair of the inlaid portfolio pierre signed the deed and after that the princess grew still kinder the younger sisters also became affectionate to him especially the youngest the pretty one with the mole who often made him feel confused by her smiles and her own confusion when meeting him 
 it seemed so natural to pierre that everyone should like him and it would have seemed so unnatural had anyone disliked him that he could not but believe in the sincerity of those around him besides he had no time to ask himself whether these people were sincere or not he was always busy and always felt in a state of mild and cheerful intoxication he felt as though he were the center of some important and general movement that something was constantly expected of him that if he did not do it he would grieve and disappoint many people but if he did this and that all would be well and he did what was demanded of him but still that happy result always remained in the future 
 more than anyone else prince vasili took possession of affairs and of pierre himself in those early days from the death of count bezukhov he did not let go his hold of the lad he had the air of a man oppressed by business weary and suffering who yet would not for sake leave this helpless youth who after all was the son of his old friend and the possessor of such enormous wealth to the caprice of fate and the designs of rogues during the few days he spent in moscow after the death of count bezukhov he would call pierre or go to him himself and tell him what ought to be done in a tone of weariness and assurance as if he were adding every time you know i am overwhelmed with business and it is purely out of charity that i trouble myself about you and you also know quite well that what i propose is the only thing possible 
 well my dear fellow tomorrow we are off at last said prince vasili one day closing his eyes and fingering elbow speaking as if he were saying something which had long since been agreed upon and could not now be altered we start tomorrow and giving you a place in my carriage i am very glad all our important business here is now settled and i ought to have been off long ago here is something i have received from the chancellor i asked him for you and you have been entered in the diplomatic corps and made a gentleman of the bedchamber the diplomatic career now lies open before you 
 notwithstanding the tone of wearied assurance with which these words were pronounced pierre who had so long been considering his career wished to make some suggestion but prince vasili interrupted him in the special deep cooing tone precluding the possibility of interrupting his speech which he used in extreme cases when special persuasion was needed 
 mais mon cher i did this for my own sake to satisfy my conscience and there is nothing to thank me for no one has ever complained yet of being too much loved and besides you are free you could throw it up tomorrow but you will see everything for yourself when you get to petersburg it is high time for you to get away from these terrible recollections prince vasili sighed yes yes my boy and my valet can go in your carriage ah i was nearly forgetting he added you know mon cher your father and i had some accounts to settle so i have received what was due from the ryazan estate and will keep it you require it go into the accounts later 
 by what was due from the ryazan estate prince vasili meant several thousand rubles quitrent received from peasants which the prince had retained for himself 
 in petersburg as in moscow pierre found the same atmosphere of gentleness and affection he could not refuse the post or rather the rank for he did nothing that prince vasili had procured for him and acquaintances invitations and social occupations were so numerous that even more than in moscow he felt a sense of bewilderment bustle and continual expectation of some good always in front of him but never attained 
 of his former bachelor acquaintances many were no longer in petersburg the guards had gone to the front dolokhov had been reduced to the ranks anatole was in the army somewhere in the provinces prince andrew was abroad so pierre had not the opportunity to spend his nights as he used to like to spend them or to open his mind by intimate talks with a friend older than himself and whom he respected his whole time was taken up with dinners and balls and was spent chiefly at prince house in the company of the stout princess his wife and his beautiful daughter helene 
 like the others anna pavlovna scherer showed pierre the change of attitude toward him that had taken place in society 
 formerly in anna presence pierre had always felt that what he was saying was out of place tactless and unsuitable that remarks which seemed to him clever while they formed in his mind became foolish as soon as he uttered them while on the contrary stupidest remarks came out clever and apt now everything pierre said was charmant even if anna pavlovna did not say so he could see that she wished to and only refrained out of regard for his modesty 
 in the beginning of the winter of pierre received one of anna usual pink notes with an invitation to which was added you will find the beautiful helene here whom it is always delightful to see 
 when he read that sentence pierre felt for the first time that some link which other people recognized had grown up between himself and helene and that thought both alarmed him as if some obligation were being imposed on him which he could not fulfill and pleased him as an entertaining supposition 
 anna at home was like the former one only the novelty she offered her guests this time was not mortemart but a diplomatist fresh from berlin with the very latest details of the emperor visit to potsdam and of how the two august friends had pledged themselves in an indissoluble alliance to uphold the cause of justice against the enemy of the human race anna pavlovna received pierre with a shade of melancholy evidently relating to the young recent loss by the death of count bezukhov everyone constantly considered it a duty to assure pierre that he was greatly afflicted by the death of the father he had hardly known and her melancholy was just like the august melancholy she showed at the mention of her most august majesty the empress marya fedorovna pierre felt flattered by this anna pavlovna arranged the different groups in her drawing room with her habitual skill the large group in which were prince vasili and the generals had the benefit of the diplomat another group was at the tea table pierre wished to join the former but anna pavlovna who was in the excited condition of a commander on a battlefield to whom thousands of new and brilliant ideas occur which there is hardly time to put in action seeing pierre touched his sleeve with her finger saying 
 wait a bit i have something in view for you this evening she glanced at helene and smiled at her my dear helene be charitable to my poor aunt who adores you go and keep her company for ten minutes and that it will not be too dull here is the dear count who will not refuse to accompany you 
 the beauty went to the aunt but anna pavlovna detained pierre looking as if she had to give some final necessary instructions 
 she exquisite she said to pierre pointing to the stately beauty as she glided away and how she carries herself for so young a girl such tact such masterly perfection of manner it comes from her heart happy the man who wins her with her the least worldly of men would occupy a most brilliant position in society you think so i only wanted to know your opinion and anna pavlovna let pierre go 
 pierre in reply sincerely agreed with her as to perfection of manner if he ever thought of helene it was just of her beauty and her remarkable skill in appearing silently dignified in society 
 the old aunt received the two young people in her corner but seemed desirous of hiding her adoration for helene and inclined rather to show her fear of anna pavlovna she looked at her niece as if inquiring what she was to do with these people on leaving them anna pavlovna again touched sleeve saying i hope you say that it is dull in my house again and she glanced at helene 
 helene smiled with a look implying that she did not admit the possibility of anyone seeing her without being enchanted the aunt coughed swallowed and said in french that she was very pleased to see helene then she turned to pierre with the same words of welcome and the same look in the middle of a dull and halting conversation helene turned to pierre with the beautiful bright smile that she gave to everyone pierre was so used to that smile and it had so little meaning for him that he paid no attention to it the aunt was just speaking of a collection of snuffboxes that had belonged to father count bezukhov and showed them her own box princess helene asked to see the portrait of the husband on the box lid 
 that is probably the work of vinesse said pierre mentioning a celebrated miniaturist and he leaned over the table to take the snuffbox while trying to hear what was being said at the other table 
 he half rose meaning to go round but the aunt handed him the snuffbox passing it across back helene stooped forward to make room and looked round with a smile she was as always at evening parties wearing a dress such as was then fashionable cut very low at front and back her bust which had always seemed like marble to pierre was so close to him that his shortsighted eyes could not but perceive the living charm of her neck and shoulders so near to his lips that he need only have bent his head a little to have touched them he was conscious of the warmth of her body the scent of perfume and the creaking of her corset as she moved he did not see her marble beauty forming a complete whole with her dress but all the charm of her body only covered by her garments and having once seen this he could not help being aware it just as we cannot renew an illusion we have once seen through 
 so you have never noticed before how beautiful i am helene seemed to say you had not noticed that i am a woman yes i am a woman who may belong to anyone to you too said her glance and at that moment pierre felt that helene not only could but must be his wife and that it could not be otherwise 
 he knew this at that moment as surely as if he had been standing at the altar with her how and when this would be he did not know he did not even know if it would be a good thing he even felt he knew not why that it would be a bad thing but he knew it would happen 
 pierre dropped his eyes lifted them again and wished once more to see her as a distant beauty far removed from him as he had seen her every day until then but he could no longer do it he could not any more than a man who has been looking at a tuft of steppe grass through the mist and taking it for a tree can again take it for a tree after he has once recognized it to be a tuft of grass she was terribly close to him she already had power over him and between them there was no longer any barrier except the barrier of his own will 
 well i will leave you in your little corner came anna voice i see you are all right there 
 and pierre anxiously trying to remember whether he had done anything reprehensible looked round with a blush it seemed to him that everyone knew what had happened to him as he knew it himself 
 a little later when he went up to the large circle anna pavlovna said to him i hear you are refitting your petersburg house 
 this was true the architect had told him that it was necessary and pierre without knowing why was having his enormous petersburg house done up 
 a good thing but move from prince it is good to have a friend like the prince she said smiling at prince vasili i know something about that i and you are still so young you need advice be angry with me for exercising an old privilege 
 she paused as women always do expecting something after they have mentioned their age if you marry it will be a different thing she continued uniting them both in one glance pierre did not look at helene nor she at him but she was just as terribly close to him he muttered something and colored 
 when he got home he could not sleep for a long time for thinking of what had happened what had happened nothing he had merely understood that the woman he had known as a child of whom when her beauty was mentioned he had said yes good looking he had understood that this woman might belong to him 
 but stupid i have myself said she is stupid he thought there is something nasty something wrong in the feeling she excites in me i have been told that her brother anatole was in love with her and she with him that there was quite a scandal and that why he was sent away hippolyte is her brother prince vasili is her father bad he reflected but while he was thinking this the reflection was still incomplete he caught himself smiling and was conscious that another line of thought had sprung up and while thinking of her worthlessness he was also dreaming of how she would be his wife how she would love him become quite different and how all he had thought and heard of her might be false and he again saw her not as the daughter of prince vasili but visualized her whole body only veiled by its gray dress but no why did this thought never occur to me before and again he told himself that it was impossible that there would be something unnatural and as it seemed to him dishonorable in this marriage he recalled her former words and looks and the words and looks of those who had seen them together he recalled anna words and looks when she spoke to him about his house recalled thousands of such hints from prince vasili and others and was seized by terror lest he had already in some way bound himself to do something that was evidently wrong and that he ought not to do but at the very time he was expressing this conviction to himself in another part of his mind her image rose in all its womanly beauty

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the new suit 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 many many years ago lived an emperor who thought so much of 
 new clothes that he spent all his money in order to obtain them his 
 only ambition was to be always well dressed he did not care for his 
 soldiers and the theatre did not amuse him the only thing in 
 fact he thought anything of was to drive out and show a new suit of 
 clothes he had a coat for every hour of the day and as one would say of a king he is in his cabinet so one could say of him the 
 emperor is in his 
 
 the great city where he resided was very gay every day many 
 strangers from all parts of the globe arrived one day two swindlers 
 came to this city they made people believe that they were weavers 
 and declared they could manufacture the finest cloth to be imagined 
 their colours and patterns they said were not only exceptionally 
 beautiful but the clothes made of their material possessed the 
 wonderful quality of being invisible to any man who was unfit for 
 his office or unpardonably stupid 
 
 that must be wonderful cloth thought the emperor if i were to 
 be dressed in a suit made of this cloth i should be able to find out 
 which men in my empire were unfit for their places and i could 
 distinguish the clever from the stupid i must have this cloth woven 
 for me without delay and he gave a large sum of money to the 
 swindlers in advance that they should set to work without any loss 
 of time they set up two looms and pretended to be very hard at work but they did nothing whatever on the looms they asked for the 
 finest silk and the most precious all they got they did 
 away with and worked at the empty looms till late at night 
 
 i should very much like to know how they are getting on with 
 the cloth thought the emperor but he felt rather uneasy when he 
 remembered that he who was not fit for his office could not see it 
 personally he was of opinion that he had nothing to fear yet he 
 thought it advisable to send somebody else first to see how matters 
 stood everybody in the town knew what a remarkable quality the 
 stuff possessed and all were anxious to see how bad or stupid their 
 neighbours were 
 
 i shall send my honest old minister to the weavers thought 
 the emperor he can judge best how the stuff looks for he is 
 intelligent and nobody understands his office better than he 
 the good old minister went into the room where the swindlers sat 
 before the empty looms heaven preserve us he thought and opened his eyes wide i cannot see anything at all but he did not say so both swindlers requested him to come near and asked him if he did not admire the exquisite pattern and the beautiful colours pointing to the empty looms the poor old minister tried his very best but he could see nothing for there was nothing to be seen oh dear he thought can i be so stupid i should never have thought so and nobody must know it is it possible that i am not fit for my office 
 
 no no i cannot say that i was unable to see the cloth 
 
 now have you got nothing to say said one of the swindlers 
 while he pretended to be busily weaving 
 
 oh it is very pretty exceedingly beautiful replied the old 
 minister looking through his glasses what a beautiful pattern 
 what brilliant colours i shall tell the emperor that i like the cloth 
 very much 
 
 we are pleased to hear that said the two weavers and described 
 to him the colours and explained the curious pattern the old minister 
 listened attentively that he might relate to the emperor what they 
 said and so he did 
 
 now the swindlers asked for more money silk and which 
 they required for weaving they kept everything for themselves and 
 not a thread came near the loom but they continued as hitherto to 
 work at the empty looms 
 
 soon afterwards the emperor sent another honest courtier to the 
 weavers to see how they were getting on and if the cloth was nearly 
 finished like the old minister he looked and looked but could see 
 nothing as there was nothing to be seen 
 
 is it not a beautiful piece of cloth asked the two swindlers 
 showing and explaining the magnificent pattern which however did 
 not exist 
 
 i am not stupid said the man it is therefore my good 
 appointment for which i am not fit it is very strange but i must not 
 let any one know it and he praised the cloth which he did not 
 see and expressed his joy at the beautiful colours and the fine 
 pattern it is very excellent he said to the emperor 
 
 everybody in the whole town talked about the precious cloth at 
 last the emperor wished to see it himself while it was still on the 
 loom with a number of courtiers including the two who had already 
 been there he went to the two clever swindlers who now worked as 
 hard as they could but without using any thread 
 
 is it not magnificent said the two old statesmen who had been 
 there before your majesty must admire the colours and the 
 pattern and then they pointed to the empty looms for they 
 imagined the others could see the cloth 
 
 what is this thought the emperor i do not see anything at 
 all that is terrible am i stupid am i unfit to be emperor that 
 would indeed be the most dreadful thing that could happen to me 
 really he said turning to the weavers your cloth has our 
 most gracious approval and nodding contentedly he looked at the 
 empty loom for he did not like to say that he saw nothing all his 
 attendants who were with him looked and looked and although they 
 could not see anything more than the others they said like the 
 emperor it is very beautiful and all advised him to wear the new 
 magnificent clothes at a great procession which was soon to take 
 place it is magnificent beautiful excellent one heard them 
 say everybody seemed to be delighted and the emperor appointed the two swindlers imperial court weavers 
 
 the whole night previous to the day on which the procession was to 
 take place the swindlers pretended to work and burned more than 
 sixteen candles people should see that they were busy to finish the 
 new suit they pretended to take the cloth from the loom 
 and worked about in the air with big scissors and sewed with 
 needles without thread and said at last the new suit is 
 ready now 
 
 the emperor and all his barons then came to the hall the 
 swindlers held their arms up as if they held something in their 
 hands and said these are the trousers this is the coat and 
 here is the cloak and so on they are all as light as a cobweb 
 and one must feel as if one had nothing at all upon the body but that 
 is just the beauty of them 
 
 indeed said all the courtiers but they could not see anything 
 for there was nothing to be seen 
 
 does it please your majesty now to graciously undress said 
 the swindlers that we may assist your majesty in putting on the 
 new suit before the large 
 
 the emperor undressed and the swindlers pretended to put the 
 new suit upon him one piece after another and the emperor looked 
 at himself in the glass from every side 
 
 how well they look how well they fit said all what a 
 beautiful pattern what fine colours that is a magnificent suit of 
 clothes 
 
 the master of the ceremonies announced that the bearers of the 
 canopy which was to be carried in the procession were ready 
 
 i am ready said the emperor does not my suit fit me 
 marvellously then he turned once more to the that 
 people should think he admired his garments 
 
 the chamberlains who were to carry the train stretched their 
 hands to the ground as if they lifted up a train and pretended to 
 hold something in their hands they did not like people to know that 
 they could not see anything 
 
 the emperor marched in the procession under the beautiful 
 canopy and all who saw him in the street and out of the windows 
 exclaimed indeed the new suit is incomparable what a 
 long train he has how well it fits him nobody wished to let 
 others know he saw nothing for then he would have been unfit for 
 his office or too stupid never clothes were more admired 
 but he has nothing on at all said a little child at last good 
 heavens listen to the voice of an innocent child said the father 
 and one whispered to the other what the child had said but he has 
 nothing on at all cried at last the whole people that made a deep 
 impression upon the emperor for it seemed to him that they were 
 right but he thought to himself now i must bear up to the end and the chamberlains walked with still greater dignity as if they carried the train which did not exist 
 
 the end

 of faction 
 many have an opinion not wise that for a prince to govern his estate or for a great 
 person to govern his proceedings according to the respect of factions is a principal part of policy whereas contrariwise the chiefest wisdom is either in ordering those things which are general and wherein men of several factions do nevertheless agree or in dealing with correspondence to particular persons one by one 
 but i say not that the consideration of factions is to be neglected mean men in their rising must adhere but great men that have strength in themselves were better to maintain themselves indifferent and neutral 
 yet even in beginners to adhere so moderately as he be a man of the one faction which is most passable with the other commonly giveth best way the lower and weaker faction is the firmer in conjunction and it is often seen that a few that are stiff do tire out a greater number that are more moderate when one of the factions is extinguished the remaining subdivided as the faction between lucullus and the rest of the nobles of the senate which they called optimates held out a while against the faction ofpompey and caesar but when the authority was ruled down caesar and pompey soon after brake 
 the faction or party of antonius and octavianus caesar against brutus and cassius held out likewise for a time but when brutus and cassius were overthrown then soon after antonius and octavianus brake and subdivided these examples are of wars but the same holdeth in private factions and therefore those that are seconds in factions do many times when the faction subdivided prove principals but many times also they prove ciphers and cashiered for many a strength is in opposition and when that faileth he groweth out of use it is commonly seen that men once placed take in with the contrary faction to that by which they enter thinking belike that they have the first sure and now are ready for a new purchase 
 the traitor in faction lightly goeth away with it for when matters have stuck long in balancing the winning of some one man casteth them and he getteth all the thanks the even carriage between two factions proceedeth not always of moderation but of a trueness to a self with end to make use of both certainly in italy they hold it a little suspect in popes when they have often in their mouth padre oommne and take it to be a sign of one that meaneth to refer all to the greatness of his own house kings had need beware how they side themselves and make themselves as of a faction or party for leagues within the state are ever pernicious to monarchies for they raise an obligation paramount to obligation of sovereignty and make the king tanquam wws ex nobis as was to be seen in the league of france 
 when factions are carried too high and too violently it is a sign of weakness in princes and much to the prejudice both of their authority and business the motions of factions under kings ought to be like the motions as the astronomers speak of the inferior orbs which may have their proper motions but yet still are quietly carried by the higher motion of primum mobile

 christus nos liberavit 
 what is this history of fantine 
 it is society purchasing a slave 
 from whom 
 from misery 
 from hunger cold isolation destitution 
 a dolorous bargain a soul for a morsel of bread 
 misery offers society accepts 
 the sacred law of jesus christ governs our civilization but it does not as yet permeate it it is said that slavery has disappeared from european civilization 
 this is a mistake 
 it still exists but it weighs only upon the woman and it is called prostitution 
 it weighs upon the woman that is to say upon grace weakness beauty maternity 
 this is not one of the least of disgraces 
 at the point in this melancholy drama which we have now reached nothing is left to fantine of that which she had formerly been 
 she has become marble in becoming mire 
 whoever touches her feels cold she passes she endures you she ignores you she is the severe and dishonored figure 
 life and the social order have said their last word for her 
 all has happened to her that will happen to her she has felt everything borne everything experienced everything suffered everything lost everything mourned everything she is resigned with that resignation which resembles indifference as death resembles sleep 
 she no longer avoids anything let all the clouds fall upon her and all the ocean sweep over her what matters it to her 
 she is a sponge that is soaked 
 at least she believes it to be so but it is an error to imagine that fate can be exhausted and that one has reached the bottom of anything whatever 
 alas 
 what are all these fates driven on whither are they going 
 why are they thus 
 he who knows that sees the whole of the shadow 
 he is alone 
 his name is god

 book three 
 chapter ii 
 
 in november prince vasili had to go on a tour of inspection in four different provinces he had arranged this for himself so as to visit his neglected estates at the same time and pick up his son anatole where his regiment was stationed and take him to visit prince nicholas bolkonski in order to arrange a match for him with the daughter of that rich old man but before leaving home and undertaking these new affairs prince vasili had to settle matters with pierre who it is true had latterly spent whole days at home that is in prince house where he was staying and had been absurd excited and foolish in presence as a lover should be but had not yet proposed to her 
 this is all very fine but things must be settled said prince vasili to himself with a sorrowful sigh one morning feeling that pierre who was under such obligations to him but never mind that was not behaving very well in this matter youth frivolity well god be with him thought he relishing his own goodness of heart but it must be brought to a head the day after tomorrow will be name day i will invite two or three people and if he does not understand what he ought to do then it will be my affair yes my affair i am her father 
 six weeks after anna at home and after the sleepless night when he had decided that to marry helene would be a calamity and that he ought to avoid her and go away pierre despite that decision had not left prince and felt with terror that in eyes he was every day more and more connected with her that it was impossible for him to return to his former conception of her that he could not break away from her and that though it would be a terrible thing he would have to unite his fate with hers he might perhaps have been able to free himself but that prince vasili who had rarely before given receptions now hardly let a day go by without having an evening party at which pierre had to be present unless he wished to spoil the general pleasure and disappoint expectation prince vasili in the rare moments when he was at home would take hand in passing and draw it downwards or hold out his wrinkled cheek for pierre to kiss and would say till tomorrow or be in to dinner or i shall not see you or i am staying in for your sake and so on and though prince vasili when he stayed in as he said for sake hardly exchanged a couple of words with him pierre felt unable to disappoint him every day he said to himself one and the same thing it is time i understood her and made up my mind what she really is was i mistaken before or am i mistaken now no she is not stupid she is an excellent girl he sometimes said to himself she never makes a mistake never says anything stupid she says little but what she does say is always clear and simple so she is not stupid she never was abashed and is not abashed now so she cannot be a bad woman he had often begun to make reflections or think aloud in her company and she had always answered him either by a brief but appropriate remark showing that it did not interest her or by a silent look and smile which more palpably than anything else showed pierre her superiority she was right in regarding all arguments as nonsense in comparison with that smile 
 she always addressed him with a radiantly confiding smile meant for him alone in which there was something more significant than in the general smile that usually brightened her face pierre knew that everyone was waiting for him to say a word and cross a certain line and he knew that sooner or later he would step across it but an incomprehensible terror seized him at the thought of that dreadful step a thousand times during that month and a half while he felt himself drawn nearer and nearer to that dreadful abyss pierre said to himself what am i doing i need resolution can it be that i have none 
 he wished to take a decision but felt with dismay that in this matter he lacked that strength of will which he had known in himself and really possessed pierre was one of those who are only strong when they feel themselves quite innocent and since that day when he was overpowered by a feeling of desire while stooping over the snuffbox at anna an unacknowledged sense of the guilt of that desire paralyzed his will 
 on name day a small party of just their own people as his wife said met for supper at prince all these friends and relations had been given to understand that the fate of the young girl would be decided that evening the visitors were seated at supper princess kuragina a portly imposing woman who had once been handsome was sitting at the head of the table on either side of her sat the more important guests an old general and his wife and anna pavlovna scherer at the other end sat the younger and less important guests and there too sat the members of the family and pierre and helene side by side prince vasili was not having any supper he went round the table in a merry mood sitting down now by one now by another of the guests to each of them he made some careless and agreeable remark except to pierre and helene whose presence he seemed not to notice he enlivened the whole party the wax candles burned brightly the silver and crystal gleamed so did the ladies toilets and the gold and silver of the epaulets servants in scarlet liveries moved round the table the clatter of plates knives and glasses mingled with the animated hum of several conversations at one end of the table the old chamberlain was heard assuring an old baroness that he loved her passionately at which she laughed at the other could be heard the story of the misfortunes of some mary viktorovna or other at the center of the table prince vasili attracted attention with a facetious smile on his face he was telling the ladies about last meeting of the imperial council at which sergey kuzmich vyazmitinov the new military governor general of petersburg had received and read the then famous rescript of the emperor alexander from the army to sergey kuzmich in which the emperor said that he was receiving from all sides declarations of the loyalty that the declaration from petersburg gave him particular pleasure and that he was proud to be at the head of such a nation and would endeavor to be worthy of it this rescript began with the words sergey kuzmich from all sides reports reach me etc 
 well and so he never got farther than sergey kuzmich asked one of the ladies 
 exactly not a breadth farther answered prince vasili laughing sergey kuzmich from all sides from all sides sergey kuzmich poor vyazmitinov could not get any farther he began the rescript again and again but as soon as he uttered sergey he sobbed tears and from all sides was smothered in sobs and he could get no farther and again his handkerchief and again sergey kuzmich from all sides and tears till at last somebody else was asked to read it 
 kuzmich from all sides and then tears someone repeated laughing 
 be unkind cried anna pavlovna from her end of the table holding up a threatening finger he is such a worthy and excellent man our dear vyazmitinov 
 everybody laughed a great deal at the head of the table where the honored guests sat everyone seemed to be in high spirits and under the influence of a variety of exciting sensations only pierre and helene sat silently side by side almost at the bottom of the table a suppressed smile brightening both their faces a smile that had nothing to do with sergey kuzmich a smile of bashfulness at their own feelings but much as all the rest laughed talked and joked much as they enjoyed their rhine wine saute and ices and however they avoided looking at the young couple and heedless and unobservant as they seemed of them one could feel by the occasional glances they gave that the story about sergey kuzmich the laughter and the food were all a pretense and that the whole attention of that company was directed to pierre and helene prince vasili mimicked the sobbing of sergey kuzmich and at the same time his eyes glanced toward his daughter and while he laughed the expression on his face clearly said yes getting on it will all be settled today anna pavlovna threatened him on behalf of our dear vyazmitinov and in her eyes which for an instant glanced at pierre prince vasili read a congratulation on his future and on his happiness the old princess sighed sadly as she offered some wine to the old lady next to her and glanced angrily at her daughter and her sigh seemed to say yes nothing left for you and me but to sip sweet wine my dear now that the time has come for these young ones to be thus boldly provocatively happy and what nonsense all this is that i am saying thought a diplomatist glancing at the happy faces of the lovers happiness 
 into the insignificant trifling and artificial interests uniting that society had entered the simple feeling of the attraction of a healthy and handsome young man and woman for one another and this human feeling dominated everything else and soared above all their affected chatter jests fell flat news was not interesting and the animation was evidently forced not only the guests but even the footmen waiting at table seemed to feel this and they forgot their duties as they looked at the beautiful helene with her radiant face and at the red broad and happy though uneasy face of pierre it seemed as if the very light of the candles was focused on those two happy faces alone 
 pierre felt that he the center of it all and this both pleased and embarrassed him he was like a man entirely absorbed in some occupation he did not see hear or understand anything clearly only now and then detached ideas and impressions from the world of reality shot unexpectedly through his mind 
 so it is all finished he thought and how has it all happened how quickly now i know that not because of her alone nor of myself alone but because of everyone it must inevitably come about they are all expecting it they are so sure that it will happen that i cannot i cannot disappoint them but how will it be i do not know but it will certainly happen thought pierre glancing at those dazzling shoulders close to his eyes 
 or he would suddenly feel ashamed of he knew not what he felt it awkward to attract attention and to be considered a lucky man and with his plain face to be looked on as a sort of paris possessed of a helen but no doubt it always is and must be so he consoled himself and besides what have i done to bring it about how did it begin i traveled from moscow with prince vasili then there was nothing so why should i not stay at his house then i played cards with her and picked up her reticule and drove out with her how did it begin when did it all come about and here he was sitting by her side as her betrothed seeing hearing feeling her nearness her breathing her movements her beauty then it would suddenly seem to him that it was not she but he was so unusually beautiful and that that was why they all looked so at him and flattered by this general admiration he would expand his chest raise his head and rejoice at his good fortune suddenly he heard a familiar voice repeating something to him a second time but pierre was so absorbed that he did not understand what was said 
 i am asking you when you last heard from bolkonski repeated prince vasili a third time how you are my dear fellow 
 prince vasili smiled and pierre noticed that everyone was smiling at him and helene well what of it if you all know it thought pierre what of it the truth and he himself smiled his gentle childlike smile and helene smiled too 
 when did you get the letter was it from olmutz repeated prince vasili who pretended to want to know this in order to settle a dispute 
 how can one talk or think of such trifles thought pierre 
 yes from olmutz he answered with a sigh 
 after supper pierre with his partner followed the others into the drawing room the guests began to disperse some without taking leave of helene some as if unwilling to distract her from an important occupation came up to her for a moment and made haste to go away refusing to let her see them off the diplomatist preserved a mournful silence as he left the drawing room he pictured the vanity of his diplomatic career in comparison with happiness the old general grumbled at his wife when she asked how his leg was oh the old fool he thought that princess helene will be beautiful still when fifty 
 i think i may congratulate you whispered anna pavlovna to the old princess kissing her soundly if i this headache have stayed longer 
 the old princess did not reply she was tormented by jealousy of her happiness 
 while the guests were taking their leave pierre remained for a long time alone with helene in the little drawing room where they were sitting he had often before during the last six weeks remained alone with her but had never spoken to her of love now he felt that it was inevitable but he could not make up his mind to take the final step he felt ashamed he felt that he was occupying someone place here beside helene this happiness is not for you some inner voice whispered to him this happiness is for those who have not in them what there is in you 
 but as he had to say something he began by asking her whether she was satisfied with the party she replied in her usual simple manner that this name day of hers had been one of the pleasantest she had ever had 
 some of the nearest relatives had not yet left they were sitting in the large drawing room prince vasili came up to pierre with languid footsteps pierre rose and said it was getting late prince vasili gave him a look of stern inquiry as though what pierre had just said was so strange that one could not take it in but then the expression of severity changed and he drew hand downwards made him sit down and smiled affectionately 
 well lelya he asked turning instantly to his daughter and addressing her with the careless tone of habitual tenderness natural to parents who have petted their children from babyhood but which prince vasili had only acquired by imitating other parents 
 and he again turned to pierre 
 sergey kuzmich from all sides he said unbuttoning the top button of his waistcoat 
 pierre smiled but his smile showed that he knew it was not the story about sergey kuzmich that interested prince vasili just then and prince vasili saw that pierre knew this he suddenly muttered something and went away it seemed to pierre that even the prince was disconcerted the sight of the discomposure of that old man of the world touched pierre he looked at helene and she too seemed disconcerted and her look seemed to say well it is your own fault 
 the step must be taken but i cannot i cannot thought pierre and he again began speaking about indifferent matters about sergey kuzmich asking what the point of the story was as he had not heard it properly helene answered with a smile that she too had missed it 
 when prince vasili returned to the drawing room the princess his wife was talking in low tones to the elderly lady about pierre 
 of course it is a very brilliant match but happiness my dear 
 marriages are made in heaven replied the elderly lady 
 prince vasili passed by seeming not to hear the ladies and sat down on a sofa in a far corner of the room he closed his eyes and seemed to be dozing his head sank forward and then he roused himself 
 aline he said to his wife go and see what they are about 
 the princess went up to the door passed by it with a dignified and indifferent air and glanced into the little drawing room pierre and helene still sat talking just as before 
 still the same she said to her husband 
 prince vasili frowned twisting his mouth his cheeks quivered and his face assumed the coarse unpleasant expression peculiar to him shaking himself he rose threw back his head and with resolute steps went past the ladies into the little drawing room with quick steps he went joyfully up to pierre his face was so unusually triumphant that pierre rose in alarm on seeing it 
 thank god said prince vasili my wife has told me everything he put one arm around pierre and the other around his daughter my dear boy lelya i am very pleased his voice trembled i loved your father and she will make you a good wife god bless you 
 he embraced his daughter and then again pierre and kissed him with his malodorous mouth tears actually moistened his cheeks 
 princess come here he shouted 
 the old princess came in and also wept the elderly lady was using her handkerchief too pierre was kissed and he kissed the beautiful hand several times after a while they were left alone again 
 all this had to be and could not be otherwise thought pierre so it is useless to ask whether it is good or bad it is good because definite and one is rid of the old tormenting doubt pierre held the hand of his betrothed in silence looking at her beautiful bosom as it rose and fell 
 helene he said aloud and paused 
 something special is always said in such cases he thought but could not remember what it was that people say he looked at her face she drew nearer to him her face flushed 
 oh take those off those she said pointing to his spectacles 
 pierre took them off and his eyes besides the strange look eyes have from which spectacles have just been removed had also a frightened and inquiring look he was about to stoop over her hand and kiss it but with a rapid almost brutal movement of her head she intercepted his lips and met them with her own her face struck pierre by its altered unpleasantly excited expression 
 it is too late now done besides i love her thought pierre 
 je vous aime he said remembering what has to be said at such moments but his words sounded so weak that he felt ashamed of himself 
 i love you 
 six weeks later he was married and settled in count large newly furnished petersburg house the happy possessor as people said of a wife who was a celebrated beauty and of millions of money

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the cock and the 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 there were two cocks one on the the other on the roof 
 they were both arrogant but which of the two rendered most service 
 
 tell us your opinion keep to ours just the same though 
 the poultry yard was divided by some planks from another yard in 
 which there was a and on the lay and grew a large 
 cucumber which was conscious of being a plant 
 
 one is born to that said the cucumber to itself not all can 
 be born cucumbers there must be other things too the hens the 
 ducks and all the animals in the next yard are creatures too now i 
 have a great opinion of the yard cock on the plank he is certainly of 
 much more importance than the who is placed so high and even creak much less crow the latter has neither hens nor 
 chicks and only thinks of himself and perspires verdigris no the 
 yard cock is really a cock his step is a dance his crowing is music 
 and wherever he goes one knows what a trumpeter is like if he would 
 only come in here even if he ate me up stump stalk and all and i 
 had to dissolve in his body it would be a happy death said the 
 cucumber 
 
 in the night there was a terrible storm the hens chicks and 
 even the cock sought shelter the wind tore down the planks between 
 the two yards with a crash the tiles came tumbling down but the 
 sat firm he did not even turn round for he could not 
 and yet he was young and freshly cast but prudent and sedate he 
 had been born old and did not at all resemble the birds flying in the 
 air the sparrows and the swallows no he despised them these 
 mean little piping birds these common whistlers he admitted that the 
 pigeons large and white and shining like looked like 
 a kind of but they were fat and stupid and all their 
 thoughts and endeavours were directed to filling themselves with food and besides they were tiresome things to converse with the birds of passage had also paid the a visit and told him of foreign countries of airy caravans and robber stories that made hair stand on end all this was new and interesting that is for 
 the first time but afterwards as the found out they 
 repeated themselves and always told the same stories and 
 very tedious and there was no one with whom one could associate 
 for one and all were stale and 
 
 the world is no good he said everything in it is so stupid 
 the was puffed up and that quality would have made 
 him interesting in the eyes of the cucumber if it had known it but it 
 had eyes only for the yard cock who was now in the yard with it 
 the wind had blown the planks but the storm was over 
 
 what do you think of that crowing said the yard cock to the 
 hens and chickens it was a little rough it wanted elegance 
 and the hens and chickens came up on the and the cock 
 strutted about like a lord 
 
 garden plant he said to the cucumber and in that one word 
 his deep learning showed itself and it forgot that he was pecking 
 at her and eating it up a happy death 
 
 the hens and the chickens came for where one runs the others 
 run too they clucked and chirped and looked at the cock and were 
 proud that he was of their kind 
 
 he crowed the chickens will grow up into 
 great hens at once if i cry it out in the of the world 
 and hens and chicks clucked and chirped and the cock announced 
 a great piece of news 
 
 a cock can lay an egg and do you know in that egg a 
 basilisk no one can stand the sight of such a thing people know 
 that and now you know it too you know what is in me and what a 
 champion of all cocks i am 
 
 with that the yard cock flapped his wings made his comb swell up 
 and crowed again and they all shuddered the hens and the little 
 chicks but they were very proud that one of their number was such a 
 champion of all cocks they clucked and chirped till the 
 heard he heard it but he did not stir 
 
 everything is very stupid the said to himself 
 
 the yard cock lays no eggs and i am too lazy to do so if i liked i 
 could lay a but the world is not worth even a 
 everything is so stupid i want to sit here any longer 
 
 with that the broke off but he did not kill the yard 
 cock although the hens said that had been his intention and what 
 is the moral better to crow than to be puffed up and break off 
 
 the end

 of ceremonies respects 
 he that is only real had need have exceeding great parts of virtue as the stone 
 had need to be rich that is set without foil but if a man mark it well it is in 
 praise and commendation of men as it is in gettings and gains for the proverb is 
 true that light gains make heavy purses for light gains come thick whereas great 
 come but now and then so it is true that small matters win great commendation 
 because they are continually in use and in note whereas the occasion of any great 
 virtue cometh but on festivals 
 therefore it doth much add to a reputation and is as queen isabella said like perpetual letters commendatory to have good forms to attain them it almost sufficeth not to despise them for so shall a man observe them in others and let him trust himself with the rest for if he labour too much to express them he shall lose their grace which is to be natural and unaffected 
 some behaviour is like a verse wherein every syllable is measured 
 how can a man comprehend great matters that hreaketh his mind too much to small observations not to use ceremonies at all is to teach others not to use them again and so diminisheth respect to himself especially they be not to be omitted to 
 strangers and formal natures but the dwelling upon them and exalting them above 
 the moon is not only tedious but doth diminish the faith and credit of him that 
 speaks 
 and certainly there is a kind of conveying of effectual and imprinting 
 passages amongst compliments which is of singular use if a man can hit upon it 
 amongst a peers a man shall be sure of familiarity and therefore it is good 
 a little to keep state amongst a inferiors one shall be sure of reverence 
 and therefore it is good a little to be familiar he that is too much in anything 
 so that he giveth another occasion of satiety maketh himself cheap to apply self to others is good so it be with demonstration that a man doth it upon regard and not upon facility it is a good precept generally in seconding another yet to add somewhat of own as if you will grant his opinion let it be with some distinction if you will follow his motion let it be with condition if you allow 
 his counsel let it be with alleging further reason men had need beware how they 
 be too perfect in compliments for be they never so sufficient otherwise their 
 enviers will be sure to give them that attribute to the disadvantage of their greater 
 virtues it is loss also in business to be too full of respects or to be too curious 
 in observing times and opportunities solomon saith he that considered the wind 
 shall not sow and he that looketh to the clouds shall not reap a wise man will make more opportunities than he finds behaviour should be like their apparel not too strait or point device but free for exercise or motion

 m inactivity 
 there is in all small towns and there was at m sur m in particular a class of young men who nibble away an income of fifteen hundred francs with the same air with which their prototypes devour two hundred thousand francs a year in paris 
 these are beings of the great neuter species 
 impotent men parasites cyphers who have a little land a little folly a little wit who would be rustics in a and who think themselves gentlemen in the who say my fields my peasants my woods who hiss actresses at the theatre to prove that they are persons of taste quarrel with the officers of the garrison to prove that they are men of war hunt smoke yawn drink smell of tobacco play billiards stare at travellers as they descend from the diligence live at the cafe dine at the inn have a dog which eats the bones under the table and a mistress who eats the dishes on the table who stick at a sou exaggerate the fashions admire tragedy despise women wear out their old boots copy london through paris and paris through the medium of grow old as dullards never work serve no use and do no great harm 
 m felix tholomyes had he remained in his own province and never beheld paris would have been one of these men 
 if they were richer one would say they are dandies if they were poorer one would say they are idlers 
 they are simply men without employment 
 among these unemployed there are bores the bored dreamers and some knaves 
 at that period a dandy was composed of a tall collar a big cravat a watch with trinkets three vests of different colors worn one on top of the red and blue inside of a olive coat with a codfish tail a double row of silver buttons set close to each other and running up to the shoulder and a pair of trousers of a lighter shade of olive ornamented on the two seams with an indefinite but always uneven number of lines varying from one to limit which was never exceeded add to this high shoes with little irons on the heels a tall hat with a narrow brim hair worn in a tuft an enormous cane and conversation set off by puns of potier 
 over all spurs and a mustache 
 at that epoch mustaches indicated the bourgeois and spurs the pedestrian 
 the provincial dandy wore the longest of spurs and the fiercest of mustaches 
 it was the period of the conflict of the republics of south america with the king of spain of bolivar against morillo hats were royalist and were called morillos liberals wore hats with wide brims which were called bolivars 
 eight or ten months then after that which is related in the preceding pages towards the first of january on a snowy evening one of these dandies one of these unemployed a right thinker for he wore a morillo and was moreover warmly enveloped in one of those large cloaks which completed the fashionable costume in cold weather was amusing himself by tormenting a creature who was prowling about in a with neck uncovered and flowers in her hair in front of the officers cafe 
 this dandy was smoking for he was decidedly fashionable 
 each time that the woman passed in front of him he bestowed on her together with a puff from his cigar some apostrophe which he considered witty and mirthful such as how ugly you are will you get out of my have no teeth etc etc this gentleman was known as m bamatabois 
 the woman a melancholy decorated spectre which went and came through the snow made him no reply did not even glance at him and nevertheless continued her promenade in silence and with a sombre regularity which brought her every five minutes within reach of this sarcasm like the condemned soldier who returns under the rods 
 the small effect which he produced no doubt piqued the lounger and taking advantage of a moment when her back was turned he crept up behind her with the gait of a wolf and stifling his laugh bent down picked up a handful of snow from the pavement and thrust it abruptly into her back between her bare shoulders 
 the woman uttered a roar whirled round gave a leap like a panther and hurled herself upon the man burying her nails in his face with the most frightful words which could fall from the into the gutter 
 these insults poured forth in a voice roughened by brandy did indeed proceed in hideous wise from a mouth which lacked its two front teeth it was fantine 
 at the noise thus produced the officers ran out in throngs from the cafe collected and a large and merry circle hooting and applauding was formed around this whirlwind composed of two beings whom there was some difficulty in recognizing as a man and a woman 
 the man struggling his hat on the ground the woman striking out with feet and fists bareheaded howling minus hair and teeth livid with wrath horrible 
 suddenly a man of lofty stature emerged vivaciously from the crowd seized the woman by her satin bodice which was covered with mud and said to her follow me 
 the woman raised her head her furious voice suddenly died away her eyes were glassy she turned pale instead of livid and she trembled with a quiver of terror 
 she had recognized javert 
 the dandy took advantage of the incident to make his escape

 chapter iii 
 
 old prince nicholas bolkonski received a letter from prince vasili in november announcing that he and his son would be paying him a visit i am starting on a journey of inspection and of course i shall think nothing of an extra seventy miles to come and see you at the same time my honored benefactor wrote prince vasili my son anatole is accompanying me on his way to the army so i hope you will allow him personally to express the deep respect that emulating his father he feels for you 
 it seems that there will be no need to bring mary out suitors are coming to us of their own accord incautiously remarked the little princess on hearing the news 
 prince nicholas frowned but said nothing 
 a fortnight after the letter prince servants came one evening in advance of him and he and his son arrived next day 
 old bolkonski had always had a poor opinion of prince character but more so recently since in the new reigns of paul and alexander prince vasili had risen to high position and honors and now from the hints contained in his letter and given by the little princess he saw which way the wind was blowing and his low opinion changed into a feeling of contemptuous ill will he snorted whenever he mentioned him on the day of prince arrival prince bolkonski was particularly discontented and out of temper whether he was in a bad temper because prince vasili was coming or whether his being in a bad temper made him specially annoyed at prince visit he was in a bad temper and in the morning tikhon had already advised the architect not to go the prince with his report 
 do you hear how walking said tikhon drawing the attention to the sound of the footsteps stepping flat on his heels we know what that means 
 however at nine the prince in his velvet coat with a sable collar and cap went out for his usual walk it had snowed the day before and the path to the hothouse along which the prince was in the habit of walking had been swept the marks of the broom were still visible in the snow and a shovel had been left sticking in one of the soft snowbanks that bordered both sides of the path the prince went through the conservatories the serfs quarters and the outbuildings frowning and silent 
 can a sleigh pass he asked his overseer a venerable man resembling his master in manners and looks who was accompanying him back to the house 
 the snow is deep i am having the avenue swept your honor 
 the prince bowed his head and went up to the porch god be thanked thought the overseer the storm has blown over 
 it would have been hard to drive up your honor he added i heard your honor that a minister is coming to visit your honor 
 the prince turned round to the overseer and fixed his eyes on him frowning 
 what a minister what minister who gave orders he said in his shrill harsh voice the road is not swept for the princess my daughter but for a minister for me there are no ministers 
 your honor i thought 
 you thought shouted the prince his words coming more and more rapidly and indistinctly you thought rascals blackgaurds teach you to think and lifting his stick he swung it and would have hit alpatych the overseer had not the latter instinctively avoided the blow thought blackguards shouted the prince rapidly 
 but although alpatych frightened at his own temerity in avoiding the stroke came up to the prince bowing his bald head resignedly before him or perhaps for that very reason the prince though he continued to shout blackgaurds throw the snow back on the road did not lift his stick again but hurried into the house 
 before dinner princess mary and mademoiselle bourienne who knew that the prince was in a bad humor stood awaiting him mademoiselle bourienne with a radiant face that said i know nothing i am the same as usual and princess mary pale frightened and with downcast eyes what she found hardest to bear was to know that on such occasions she ought to behave like mademoiselle bourienne but could not she thought if i seem not to notice he will think that i do not sympathize with him if i seem sad and out of spirits myself he will say as he has done before that in the dumps 
 the prince looked at his frightened face and snorted 
 fool or dummy he muttered 
 and the other one is not here been telling tales he thought referring to the little princess who was not in the dining room 
 where is the princess he asked hiding 
 she is not very well answered mademoiselle bourienne with a bright smile so she come down it is natural in her state 
 hm hm muttered the prince sitting down 
 his plate seemed to him not quite clean and pointing to a spot he flung it away tikhon caught it and handed it to a footman the little princess was not unwell but had such an overpowering fear of the prince that hearing he was in a bad humor she had decided not to appear 
 i am afraid for the baby she said to mademoiselle bourienne heaven knows what a fright might do 
 in general at bald hills the little princess lived in constant fear and with a sense of antipathy to the old prince which she did not realize because the fear was so much the stronger feeling the prince reciprocated this antipathy but it was overpowered by his contempt for her when the little princess had grown accustomed to life at bald hills she took a special fancy to mademoiselle bourienne spent whole days with her asked her to sleep in her room and often talked with her about the old prince and criticized him 
 so we are to have visitors mon prince remarked mademoiselle bourienne unfolding her white napkin with her rosy fingers his excellency prince vasili kuragin and his son i understand she said inquiringly 
 hm his excellency is a puppy i got him his appointment in the service said the prince disdainfully why his son is coming i understand perhaps princess elizabeth and princess mary know i want him he looked at his blushing daughter are you unwell today eh afraid of the minister as that idiot alpatych called him this morning 
 no mon pere 
 though mademoiselle bourienne had been so unsuccessful in her choice of a subject she did not stop talking but chattered about the conservatories and the beauty of a flower that had just opened and after the soup the prince became more genial 
 after dinner he went to see his the little princess was sitting at a small table chattering with masha her maid she grew pale on seeing her 
 she was much altered she was now plain rather than pretty her cheeks had sunk her lip was drawn up and her eyes drawn down 
 yes i feel a kind of oppression she said in reply to the question as to how she felt 
 do you want anything 
 no merci mon pere 
 well all right all right 
 he left the room and went to the waiting room where alpatych stood with bowed head 
 has the snow been shoveled back 
 yes your excellency forgive me for sake it was only my stupidity 
 all right all right interrupted the prince and laughing his unnatural way he stretched out his hand for alpatych to kiss and then proceeded to his study 
 prince vasili arrived that evening he was met in the avenue by coachmen and footmen who with loud shouts dragged his sleighs up to one of the lodges over the road purposely laden with snow 
 prince vasili and anatole had separate rooms assigned to them 
 anatole having taken off his overcoat sat with arms akimbo before a table on a corner of which he smilingly and fixed his large and handsome eyes he regarded his whole life as a continual round of amusement which someone for some reason had to provide for him and he looked on this visit to a churlish old man and a rich and ugly heiress in the same way all this might he thought turn out very well and amusingly and why not marry her if she really has so much money that never does any harm thought anatole 
 he shaved and scented himself with the care and elegance which had become habitual to him and his handsome head held high entered his room with the and victorious air natural to him prince two valets were busy dressing him and he looked round with much animation and cheerfully nodded to his son as the latter entered as if to say yes how i want you to look 
 i say father joking apart is she very hideous anatole asked as if continuing a conversation the subject of which had often been mentioned during the journey 
 enough what nonsense above all try to be respectful and cautious with the old prince 
 if he starts a row go away said prince anatole i bear those old men eh 
 remember for you everything depends on this 
 in the meantime not only was it known in the maidservants rooms that the minister and his son had arrived but the appearance of both had been minutely described princess mary was sitting alone in her room vainly trying to master her agitation 
 why did they write why did lise tell me about it it can never happen she said looking at herself in the glass how shall i enter the drawing room even if i like him i now be myself with him the mere thought of her look filled her with terror the little princess and mademoiselle bourienne had already received from masha the maid the necessary report of how handsome the son was with his rosy cheeks and dark eyebrows and with what difficulty the father had dragged his legs upstairs while the son had followed him like an eagle three steps at a time having received this information the little princess and mademoiselle bourienne whose chattering voices had reached her from the corridor went into princess room 
 you know come marie said the little princess waddling in and sinking heavily into an armchair 
 she was no longer in the loose gown she generally wore in the morning but had on one of her best dresses her hair was carefully done and her face was animated which however did not conceal its sunken and faded outlines dressed as she used to be in petersburg society it was still more noticeable how much plainer she had become some unobtrusive touch had been added to mademoiselle toilet which rendered her fresh and prettyface yet more attractive 
 what are you going to remain as you are dear princess she began be announcing that the gentlemen are in the drawing room and we shall have to go down and you have not smartened yourself up at all 
 the little princess got up rang for the maid and hurriedly and merrily began to devise and carry out a plan of how princess mary should be dressed princess was wounded by the fact that the arrival of a suitor agitated her and still more so by both her companions not having the least conception that it could be otherwise to tell them that she felt ashamed for herself and for them would be to betray her agitation while to decline their offers to dress her would prolong their banter and insistence she flushed her beautiful eyes grew dim red blotches came on her face and it took on the unattractive martyrlike expression it so often wore as she submitted herself to mademoiselle bourienne and lise both these women quite sincerely tried to make her look pretty she was so plain that neither of them could think of her as a rival so they began dressing her with perfect sincerity and with the naive and firm conviction women have that dress can make a face pretty 
 no really my dear this dress is not pretty said lise looking sideways at princess mary from a little distance you have a maroon dress have it fetched really you know the fate of your whole life may be at stake but this one is too light not becoming 
 it was not the dress but the face and whole figure of princess mary that was not pretty but neither mademoiselle bourienne nor the little princess felt this they still thought that if a blue ribbon were placed in the hair the hair combed up and the blue scarf arranged lower on the best maroon dress and so on all would be well they forgot that the frightened face and the figure could not be altered and that however they might change the setting and adornment of that face it would still remain piteous and plain after two or three changes to which princess mary meekly submitted just as her hair had been arranged on the top of her head a style that quite altered and spoiled her looks and she had put on a maroon dress with a scarf the little princess walked twice round her now adjusting a fold of the dress with her little hand now arranging the scarf and looking at her with her head bent first on one side and then on the other 
 no it will not do she said decidedly clasping her hands no mary really this dress does not suit you i prefer you in your little gray everyday dress now please do it for my sake katie she said to the maid bring the princess her gray dress and see mademoiselle bourienne how i shall arrange it she added smiling with a foretaste of artistic pleasure 
 but when katie brought the required dress princess mary remained sitting motionless before the glass looking at her face and saw in the mirror her eyes full of tears and her mouth quivering ready to burst into sobs 
 come dear princess said mademoiselle bourienne just one more little effort 
 the little princess taking the dress from the maid came up to princess mary 
 well now arrange something quite simple and becoming she said 
 the three voices hers mademoiselle and who was laughing at something mingled in a merry sound like the chirping of birds 
 no leave me alone said princess mary 
 her voice sounded so serious and so sad that the chirping of the birds was silenced at once they looked at the beautiful large thoughtful eyes full of tears and of thoughts gazing shiningly and imploringly at them and understood that it was useless and even cruel to insist 
 at least change your coiffure said the little princess i tell you she went on turning reproachfully to mademoiselle bourienne is a face which such a coiffure does not suit in the least not in the least please change it 
 leave me alone please leave me alone it is all quite the same to me answered a voice struggling with tears 
 mademoiselle bourienne and the little princess had to own to themselves that princess mary in this guise looked very plain worse than usual but it was too late she was looking at them with an expression they both knew an expression thoughtful and sad this expression in princess mary did not frighten them she never inspired fear in anyone but they knew that when it appeared on her face she became mute and was not to be shaken in her determination 
 you will change it you said lise and as princess mary gave no answer she left the room 
 princess mary was left alone she did not comply with request she not only left her hair as it was but did not even look in her glass letting her arms fall helplessly she sat with downcast eyes and pondered a husband a man a strong dominant and strangely attractive being rose in her imagination and carried her into a totally different happy world of his own she fancied a child her own such as she had seen the day before in the arms of her daughter at her own breast the husband standing by and gazing tenderly at her and the child but no it is impossible i am too ugly she thought 
 please come to tea the prince will be out in a moment came the voice at the door 
 she roused herself and felt appalled at what she had been thinking and before going down she went into the room where the icons hung and her eyes fixed on the dark face of a large icon of the saviour lit by a lamp she stood before it with folded hands for a few moments a painful doubt filled her soul could the joy of love of earthly love for a man be for her in her thoughts of marriage princess mary dreamed of happiness and of children but her strongest most deeply hidden longing was for earthly love the more she tried to hide this feeling from others and even from herself the stronger it grew o god she said how am i to stifle in my heart these temptations of the devil how am i to renounce forever these vile fancies so as peacefully to fulfill thy will and scarcely had she put that question than god gave her the answer in her own heart desire nothing for thyself seek nothing be not anxious or envious future and thy own fate must remain hidden from thee but live so that thou mayest be ready for anything if it be will to prove thee in the duties of marriage be ready to fulfill his will with this consoling thought but yet with a hope for the fulfillment of her forbidden earthly longing princess mary sighed and having crossed herself went down thinking neither of her gown and coiffure nor of how she would go in nor of what she would say what could all that matter in comparison with the will of god without whose care not a hair of head can fall
