lionfish nov chapter nine the woes of mrs weasleycontents prev chapter next chapter 
 abrupt departure took harry completely by surprise he remained sitting where he was in the chained chair struggling with his feelings of shock and relief the wizengamot were all getting to their feet talking gathering up their papers and packing them away harry stood up nobody seemed to be paying him the slightest bit of attention except the toadlike witch on right who was now gazing down at him instead of at dumbledore ignoring her he tried to catch eye or madam wanting to ask whether he was free to go but fudge seemed quite determined not to notice harry and madam bones was busy with her briefcase so he took a lew tentative steps towards the exit and when nobody called him back broke into a very fast walk 
 
 he took the last lew steps at a run wrenched open the door and almost collided with mr weasley who was standing right outside looking pale and apprehensive 
 
 dumbledore say 
 
 cleared harry said pulling the door closed behind him of all charges 
 
 beaming mr weasley seized harry by the shoulders 
 
 harry wonderful well of course they have found you guilty not on the evidence but even so i pretend i 
 
 but mr weasley broke off because the courtroom door had ust opened again the wizengamot were filing out 
 
 beard exclaimed mr weasley wonderingly pulling harry aside to let them all pass you were tried by the full court 
 
 i think so said harry quietly 
 
 one or two of the wizards nodded to harry as they passed and a few including madam bones said morning arthur to mr weasley but most averted their eyes cornelius fudge and the toadlike witch were almost the last to leave the dungeon fudge acted as though mr weasley and harry were part of the wall but again the witch looked almost appraisingly at harry as she passed last of all to pass was percy like fudge he completely ignored his father and harry he marched past clutching a large roll of parchment and a handful of spare quills his back rigid and his nose in the air the lines around mr mouth tightened slightly but other than this he gave no sign that he had seen his third son 
 
 going to take you straight back so you can tell the others the good news he said beckoning harry forwards as heels disappeared up the steps to level nine drop you off on the way to that toilet in bethnal green come on 
 
 so what will you have to do about the toilet harry asked grinning everything suddenly seemed five times funnier than usual it was starting to sink in he was cleared he was going back to hogwarts 
 
 oh a simple enough said mr weasley as they mounted the stairs but not so much having to repair the damage more the attitude behind the vandalism harry might strike some wizards as funny but an expression of something much deeper and nastier and i for one 
 
 mr weasley broke off in they had just reached the corridor and cornelius fudge was standing a few feet away from them talking quietly to a tall man with sleek blond hair and a pointed pale face 
 
 the second man turned at the sound of their footsteps he too broke off in his cold grey eyes narrowed and fixed upon face 
 
 well well well patronus potter said lucius malfoy coolly 
 
 harry felt winded as though he had just walked into something solid he had last seen those cold grey eyes through slits in a death hood and last heard that voice jeering in a dark graveyard while lord voldemort tortured him harry could not believe that lucius malfoy dared look him in the face he could not believe that he was here in the ministry of magic or that cornelius fudge was talking to him when harry had told fudge mere weeks ago that malfoy was a death eater 
 
 the minister was just telling me about your lucky escape potter drawled mr malfoy quite astonishing the way you continue to wriggle out of very tight holes snakelike in fact 
 
 mr weasley gripped shoulder in warning 
 
 yeah said harry yeah good at escaping 
 
 lucius malfoy raised his eyes to mr face 
 
 and arthur weasley too what are you doing here arthur 
 
 i work here said mr weasley curtly 
 
 not here surely said mr malfoy raising his eyebrows and glancing towards the door over mr shoulder i thought you were up on the second floor you do something that involves sneaking muggle artefacts home and bewitching them 
 
 no mr weasley snapped his fingers now biting into shoulder 
 
 what areyou doing here anyway harry asked lucius malfoy 
 
 i think private matters between myself and the minister are any concern of yours potter said malfoy smoothing the front of his robes harry distinctly heard the gentle clinking of what sounded like a full pocket of gold really just because you are favourite boy you must not expect the same indulgence from the rest of us shall we go up to your office then minister 
 
 certainly said fudge turning his back on harry and mr weasley this way lucius 
 
 they strode off together talking in low voices mr weasley did not let go of shoulder until they had disappeared into the lift 
 
 why he waiting outside office if got business to do together harry burst out furiously what was he doing down here 
 
 trying to sneak down to the courtroom if you ask me said mr weasley looking extremely agitated and glancing over his shoulder as though making sure they could not be overheard trying to find out whether been expelled or not leave a note for dumbledore when i drop you off he ought to know been talking to fudge again 
 
 what private business have they got together anyway 
 
 gold i expect said mr weasley angrily been giving generously to all sorts of things for years gets him in with the right people then he can ask favours delay laws he want passed oh very lucius malfoy 
 
 the lift arrived it was empty except for a flock of memos that flapped around mr head as he pressed the button for the atrium and the doors clanged shut he waved them away irritably 
 
 mr weasley said harry slowly if fudge is meeting death eaters like malfoy if seeing them alone how do we know they put the imperius curse on him 
 
 think it occurred to us harry said mr weasley quietly but dumbledore thinks fudge is acting of his own accord at the momentwhich as dumbledore says is not a lot of comfort best not talk about it any more just now harry 
 
 the doors slid open and they stepped out into the now atrium eric the watchwizard was hidden behind his daily prophet again they had walked straight past the golden fountain before harry remembered 
 
 wait he told mr weasley and pulling his moneybag from his pocket he turned back to the fountain 
 
 he looked up into the handsome face but up close harry thought he looked rather weak and foolish the witch was wearing a vapid smile like a beauty contestant and from what harry knew of goblins and centaurs they were most unlikely to be caught staring so soppily at humans of any description only the attitude of creeping servility looked convincing with a grin at the thought of what hermione would say if she could see the statue of the elf harry turned his moneybag and emptied not just ten galleons but the whole contents into the pool at the statues feet 
 
 i knew it yelled ron punching the air you always get away with stuff 
 
 they were bound to clear you said hermione who had looked positively faint with anxiety when harry had entered the kitchen and was now holding a shaking hand over her eyes there was no case against you none at all 
 
 everyone seems quite relieved though considering you all knew get off said harry smiling 
 
 mrs weasley was wiping her face on her apron and fred george and ginny were doing a kind of war dance to a chant that went he got off he got off he got off 
 
 enough settle down shouted mr weasley though he too was smiling listen sirius lucius malfoy was at the ministry 
 
 what said sirius sharply 
 
 he got off he got off he got off 
 
 be quiet you three yes we saw him talking to fudge on level nine then they went up to office together dumbledore ought to know 
 
 absolutely said sirius tell him worry 
 
 well better get going a vomiting toilet waiting for me in bethnal green molly be late covering for tonks but kingsley might be dropping in for dinner 
 
 he got off he got off he got off 
 
 enoughfredgeorgeginny said mrs weasley as mr weasley left the kitchen harry dear come and sit down have some lunch you hardly ate breakfast 
 
 ron and hermione sat themselves down opposite him looking happier than they had done since he had first arrived at grimmauld place and feeling of giddy relief which had been somewhat dented by his encounter with lucius malfoy swelled again the gloomy house seemed warmer and more welcoming all of a sudden even kreacher looked less ugly as he poked his snoutlike nose into the kitchen to investigate the source of all the noise 
 
 course once dumbledore turned up on your side there was no way they were going to convict you said ron happily now dishing great mounds of mashed potato on to plates 
 
 yeah he swung it for me said harry he felt it would sound highly ungrateful not to mention childish to say i wish talked to me though or even looked at me 
 
 and as he thought this the scar on his forehead burned so badly that he clapped his hand to it 
 
 up said hermione looking alarmed 
 
 scar harry mumbled but nothing it happens all the time now 
 
 none of the others had noticed a thing all of them were now helping themselves to food while gloating over narrow escape fred george and ginny were still singing hermione looked rather anxious but before she could say anything ron had said happily i bet dumbledore turns up this evening to celebrate with us you know 
 
 i think be able to ron said mrs weasley setting a huge plate of roast chicken down in front of harry really very busy at the moment 
 
 he got off he got off he got off 
 
 shut up roared mrs weasley 
 
 over the next few days harry could not help noticing that there was one person within number twelve grimmauld place who did not seem wholly overjoyed that he would be returning to hogwarts sirius had put up a very good show of happiness on first hearing the news wringing hand and beaming just like the rest of them soon however he was moodier and surlier than before talking less to everybody even harry and spending increasing amounts of time shut up in his room with buckbeak 
 
 you go feeling guilty said hermione sternly after harry had confided some of his feelings to her and ron while they scrubbed out a mouldy cupboard on the third floor a few days later you belong at hogwarts and sirius knows it personally i think being selfish 
 
 a bit harsh hermione said ron frowning as he attempted to prise off a bit of mould that had attached itself firmly to his finger you want to be stuck inside this house without any company 
 
 have company said hermione headquarters to the order of the phoenix it he just got his hopes up that harry would be coming to live here with him 
 
 i think true said harry wringing out his cloth he give me a straight answer when i asked him if i could 
 
 he just want to get his own hopes up even more said hermione wisely and he probably felt a bit guilty himself because i think a part of him was really hoping be expelled then both be outcasts together 
 
 come off it said harry and ron together but hermione merely shrugged 
 
 suit yourselves but i sometimes think right and sirius gets confused about whether you or your father harry 
 
 so you think touched in the head said harry heatedly 
 
 no i just think been very lonely for a long time said hermione simply 
 
 at this point mrs weasley entered the bedroom behind them 
 
 still not finished she said poking her head into the cupboard 
 
 i thought you might be here to tell us to have a break said ron bitterly know how much mould got rid of since we arrived here 
 
 you were so keen to help the order said mrs weasley you can do your bit by making headquarters fit to live in 
 
 i feel like a grumbled ron 
 
 well now you understand what dreadful lives they lead perhaps be a bit more active in said hermione hopefully as mrs weasley left them to it you know maybe it be a bad idea to show people exactly how horrible it is to clean all the timewe could do a sponsored scrub of gryffindor common room all proceeds to it would raise awareness as well as funds 
 
 sponsor you to shut up about spew ron muttered irritably but only so harry could hear him 
 
 harry found himself daydreaming about hogwarts more and more as the end of the holidays approached he could not wait to see hagrid again to play quidditch even to stroll across the vegetable patches to the herbology greenhouses it would be a treat just to leave this dusty musty house where half of the cupboards were still bolted shut and kreacher wheezed insults out of the shadows as you passed though harry was careful not to say any of this within earshot of sirius 
 
 the fact was that living at the headquarters of the movement was not nearly as interesting or exciting as harry would have expected before experienced it though members of the order of the phoenix came and went regularly sometimes staying for meals sometimes only for a few minutes of whispered conversation mrs weasley made sure that harry and the others were kept well out of earshot whether extendable or normal and nobody not even sirius seemed to feel that harry needed to know anything more than he had heard on the night of his arrival 
 
 on the very last day of the holidays harry was sweeping up owl droppings from the top of the wardrobe when ron entered their bedroom carrying a couple of envelopes 
 
 booklists have arrived he said throwing one of the envelopes up to harry who was standing on a chair about time i thought forgotten they usually come much earlier than this 
 
 harry swept the last of the droppings into a rubbish bag and threw the bag over head into the wastepaper basket in the corner which swallowed it and belched loudly he then opened his letter it contained two pieces of parchment one the usual reminder that term started on the first of september the other telling him which books he would need for the coming year 
 
 only two new ones he said reading the list the standard book of spells grade by miranda goshawk and defensive magical theory by wilbert slinkhard 
 
 crack 
 
 fred and george apparated right beside harry he was so used to them doing this by now that he even fall off his chair 
 
 we were just wondering who assigned the slinkhard book said fred conversationally 
 
 because it means found a new defence against the dark arts teacher said george 
 
 and about time too said fred 
 
 what mean harry asked jumping down beside them 
 
 well we overheard mum and dad talking on the extendable ears a few weeks back fred told harry and from what they were saying dumbledore was having real trouble finding anyone to do the job this year 
 
 not surprising is it when you look at happened to the last four said george 
 
 one sacked one dead memory removed and one locked in a trunk for nine months said harry counting them off on his fingers yeah i see what you mean 
 
 up with you ron asked fred 
 
 ron did not answer harry looked round ron was standing very still with his mouth slightly open gaping at his letter from hogwarts 
 
 the matter said fred impatiently moving around ron to look over his shoulder at the parchment 
 
 mouth fell open too 
 
 prefect he said staring incredulously at the letter prefect 
 
 george leapt forward seized the envelope in other hand and turned it harry saw something scarlet and gold fall into palm 
 
 no way said george in a hushed voice 
 
 been a mistake said fred snatching the letter out of grasp and holding it up to the light as though checking for a watermark no one in their right mind would make ron a prefect 
 
 the twins heads turned in unison and both of them stared at harry 
 
 we thought you were a cert said fred in a tone that suggested harry had tricked them in some way 
 
 we thought dumbledore was bound to pick you said george indignantly 
 
 winning the triwizard and everything said fred 
 
 i suppose all the mad stuff counted against him said george to fred 
 
 yeah said fred slowly yeah caused too much trouble mate well at least one of got their priorities right 
 
 he strode over to harry and clapped him on the back while giving ron a scathing look 
 
 prefect ickle ronnie the prefect 
 
 oh going to be revolting groaned george thrusting the prefect badge back at ron as though it might contaminate him 
 
 ron who still had not said a word took the badge stared at it for a moment then held it out to harry as though asking mutely for confirmation that it was genuine harry took it a large p was superimposed on the gryffindor lion he had seen a badge just like this on chest on his very first day at hogwarts 
 
 the door banged open hermione came tearing into the room her cheeks flushed and her hair flying there was an envelope in her hand 
 
 did youdid you get 
 
 she spotted the badge in hand and let out a shriek 
 
 i knew it she said excitedly brandishing her letter me too harry me too 
 
 no said harry quickly pushing the badge back into hand ron not me 
 
 itwhat 
 
 prefect not me harry said 
 
 ron said hermione her jaw dropping but are you sure i mean 
 
 she turned red as ron looked round at her with a defiant expression on his lace 
 
 my name on the letter he said 
 
 i said hermione looking thoroughly bewildered i well wow well done ron really 
 
 unexpected said george nodding 
 
 no said hermione blushing harder than ever no not done loads of really 
 
 the door behind her opened a little wider and mrs weasley backed into the room carrying a pile of freshly laundered robes 
 
 ginny said the booklists had come at last she said glancing around at all the envelopes as she made her way over to the bed and started sorting the robes into two piles if you give them to me take them over to diagon alley this afternoon and get your books while packing ron have to get you more pyjamas these are at least six inches too short i believe how fast growing what colour would you like 
 
 get him red and gold to match his badge said george smirking 
 
 match his what said mrs weasley absently rolling up a pair of maroon socks and placing them on pile 
 
 his badge said fred with the air of getting the worst over quickly his lovely shiny new badge 
 
 words took a moment to penetrate mrs preoccupation with pyjamas 
 
 his but ron not 
 
 ron held up his badge 
 
 mrs weasley let out a shriek just like 
 
 i believe it i believe it oh ron how wonderful a prefect everyone in the family 
 
 what are fred and i neighbours said george indignantly as his mother pushed him aside and flung her arms around her youngest son 
 
 wait until your father hears ron so proud of you what wonderful news you could end up head boy just like bill and percy the first step oh what a thing to happen in the middle of all this worry just thrilled oh ronnie 
 
 fred and george were both making loud retching noises behind her back but mrs weasley did not notice arms tight around neck she was kissing him all over his face which had turned a brighter scarlet than his badge 
 
 mum mum get a grip he muttered trying to push her away 
 
 she let go of him and said breathlessly well what will it be we gave percy an owl but already got one of course 
 
 do you mean said ron looking as though he did not dare believe his ears 
 
 got to have a reward for this said mrs weasley fondly how about a nice new set of dress robes 
 
 already bought him some said fred sourly who looked as though he sincerely regretted this generosity 
 
 or a new cauldron old rusting through or a new rat you always liked scabbers 
 
 mum said ron hopefully can i have a new broom 
 
 mrs face fell slightly broomsticks were expensive 
 
 not a really good one ron hastened to add justjust a new one for a change 
 
 mrs weasley hesitated then smiled 
 
 of course you can well better get going if got a broom to buy too see you all later little ronnie a prefect and forget to pack your trunks a prefect oh all of a dither 
 
 she gave ron yet another kiss on the cheek sniffed loudly and bustled from the room 
 
 fred and george exchanged looks 
 
 you mind if we kiss you do you ron said fred in a falsely anxious voice 
 
 we could curtsey if you like said george 
 
 oh shut up said ron scowling at them 
 
 or what said fred an evil grin spreading across his face going to put us in detention 
 
 love to see him try sniggered george 
 
 he could if you watch out said hermione angrily 
 
 fred and george burst out laughing and ron muttered drop it hermione 
 
 going to have to watch our step george said fred pretending to tremble with these two on our case 
 
 yeah it looks like our days are finally over said george shaking his head 
 
 and with another loud crack the twins disapparated 
 
 those two said hermione furiously staring up at the ceiling through which they could now hear fred and george roaring with laughter in the room upstairs pay any attention to them ron only jealous 
 
 i think they are said ron doubtfully also looking up at the ceiling always said only prats become prefects still he added on a happier note never had new brooms i wish i could go with mum and choose never be able to afford a nimbus but the new cleansweep out be great yeah i think go and tell her i like the cleansweep just so she knows 
 
 he dashed from the room leaving harry and hermione alone 
 
 for some reason harry found he did not want to look at hermione he turned to his bed picked up the pile of clean robes mrs weasley had laid on it and crossed the room to his trunk 
 
 harry said hermione tentatively 
 
 well done hermione said harry so heartily it did not sound like his voice at all and still not looking at her brilliant prefect great 
 
 thanks said hermione ermharrycould i borrow hedwig so i can tell mum and dad be really pleasedi mean prefect is something they can understand 
 
 yeah no problem said harry still in the horrible hearty voice that did not belong to him take her 
 
 he leaned over his trunk laid the robes on the bottom of it and pretended to be rummaging for something while hermione crossed to the wardrobe and called hedwig down a few moments passed harry heard the door close but remained bent double listening the only sounds he could hear were the blank picture on the wall sniggering again and the wastepaper basket in the corner coughing up the owl droppings 
 
 he straightened up and looked behind him hermione had left and hedwig had gone harry hurried across the room closed the door then returned slowly to his bed and sank on to it gazing unseeingly at the foot of the wardrobe 
 
 he had forgotten completely about prefects being chosen in the fifth year he had been too anxious about the possibility of being expelled to spare a thought for the fact that badges must be winging their way towards certain people but if he had remembered if he had thought about it what would he have expected 
 
 not this said a small and truthful voice inside his head 
 
 harry screwed up his face and buried it in his hands he could not lie to himself if he had known the prefect badge was on its way he would have expected it to come to him not ron did this make him as arrogant as draco malfoy did he think himself superior to everyone else did he really believe he was better than ron 
 
 no said the small voice defiantly 
 
 was that true harry wondered anxiously probing his own feelings 
 
 better at quidditch said the voice but not better at anything else 
 
 that was definitely true harry thought he was no better than ron in lessons but what about outside lessons what about those adventures he ron and hermione had had together since starting at hogwarts often risking much worse than expulsion 
 
 well ron and hermione were with me most of the time said the voice in head 
 
 not all the time though harry argued with himself they fight quirrell with me they take on riddle and the basilisk they get rid of all those dementors the night sirius escaped they in that graveyard with me the night voldemort returned 
 
 and the same feeling of that had overwhelmed him on the night he had arrived rose again definitely done more harry thought indignantly done more than either of them 
 
 but maybe said the small voice fairly maybe dumbledore choose prefects because got themselves into a load of dangerous situations maybe he chooses them for other reasons ron must have something you 
 
 harry opened his eyes and stared through his fingers at the clawed feet remembering what fred had said 
 
 no one in their right mind would make ron a prefect 
 
 harry gave a small snort of laughter a second later he felt sickened with himself 
 
 ron had not asked dumbledore to give him the prefect badge this was not fault was he harry best friend in the world going to sulk because he have a badge laugh with the twins behind back ruin this for ron when for the first time he had beaten harry at something 
 
 at this point harry heard footsteps on the stairs again he stood up straightened his glasses and hitched a grin on to his face as ron bounded back through the door 
 
 just caught her he said happily she says get the cleansweep if she can 
 
 cool harry said and he was relieved to hear that his voice had stopped sounding hearty listenronwell done mate 
 
 the smile faded off face 
 
 i never thought it would be me he said shaking his head i thought it would be you 
 
 nah caused too much trouble harry said echoing fred 
 
 yeah said ron yeah i suppose well better get our trunks packed we 
 
 it was odd how widely their possessions seemed to have scattered themselves since they had arrived it took them most of the afternoon to retrieve their books and belongings from all over the house and stow them back inside their school trunks marry noticed that ron kept moving his badge around first placing it on his bedside table then putting it into his jeans pocket then taking it out and lying it on his folded robes as though to see the effect of the red on the black only when fred and george dropped in and offered to attach it to his forehead with a permanent sticking charm did he wrap it tenderly in his maroon socks and lock it in his trunk 
 
 mrs weasley returned from diagon alley around six laden with books and carrying a long package wrapped in thick brown paper that ron took from her with a moan of longing 
 
 never mind unwrapping it now people are arriving for dinner i want you all downstairs she said but the moment she was out of sight ron ripped off the paper in a frenzy and examined every inch of his new broom an ecstatic expression on his face 
 
 down in the basement mrs weasley had hung a scarlet banner over the heavily laden dinner table which read congratulations ron and hermionenew prefects she looked in a better mood than harry had seen her all holiday 
 
 i thought have a little party not a dinner she told harry ron hermione fred george and ginny as they entered the room your father and bill are on their way ron sent them both owls and thrilled she added beaming 
 
 fred rolled his eyes 
 
 sirius lupin tonks and kingsley shacklebolt were already there and moody stumped in shortly after harry had got himself a butterbeer 
 
 oh alastor i am glad here said mrs weasley brightly as shrugged off his travelling cloak been wanting to ask you for agescould you have a look in the writing desk in the drawing room and tell us inside it we wanted to open it just in case something really nasty 
 
 no problem molly 
 
 eye swivelled upwards and stared fixedly through the ceiling of the kitchen 
 
 drawing room he growled as the pupil contracted desk in the corner yeah i see it yeah a boggart want me to go up and get rid of it molly 
 
 no no do it myself later beamed mrs weasley you have your drink having a little bit of a celebration actually she gestured at the scarlet banner fourth prefect in the family she said fondly ruffling hair 
 
 prefect eh growled moody his normal eye on ron and his magical eye swivelling around to gaze into the side of his head harry had the very uncomfortable feeling it was looking at him and moved away towards sirius and lupin 
 
 well congratulations said moody still glaring at ron with his normal eye authority figures always attract trouble but i suppose dumbledore thinks you can withstand most major jinxes or he have appointed you 
 
 ron looked rather startled at this view of the matter but was saved the trouble of responding by the arrival of his father and eldest brother mrs weasley was in such a good mood she did not even complain that they had brought mundungus with them he was wearing a long overcoat that seemed oddly lumpy in unlikely places and declined the offer to remove it and put it with travelling cloak 
 
 well i think a toast is in order said mr weasley when everyone had a drink he raised his goblet to ron and hermione the new gryffindor prefects 
 
 ron and hermione beamed as everyone drank to them and then applauded 
 
 i was never a prefect myself said tonks brightly from behind harry as everybody moved towards the table to help themselves to food her hair was tomato red and today she looked like older sister my head of house said i lacked certain necessary qualities 
 
 like what said ginny who was choosing a baked potato 
 
 like the ability to behave myself said tonks 
 
 ginny laughed hermione looked as though she did not know whether to smile or not and compromised by taking an extra large gulp of butterbeer and choking on it 
 
 what about you sirius ginny asked thumping hermione on the back 
 
 sirius who was right beside harry let out his usual laugh 
 
 no one would have made me a prefect i spent too much time in detention with james lupin was the good boy he got the badge 
 
 i think dumbledore might have hoped i would be able to exercise some control over my best friends said lupin i need scarcely say that i failed dismally 
 
 mood suddenly lifted his father had not been a prefect either all at once the party seemed much more enjoyable he loaded up his plate feeling doubly fond of everyone in the room 
 
 ron was rhapsodising about his new broom to anybody who would listen 
 
 nought to seventy in ten seconds not bad is it when you think the comet two only nought to sixty and with a decent tailwind according to which broomstick 
 
 hermione was talking very earnestly to lupin about her view of elf rights 
 
 i mean the same kind of nonsense as werewolf segregation it it all stems from this horrible thing wizards have of thinking superior to other creatures 
 
 mrs weasley and bill were having their usual argument about hair 
 
 getting really out of hand and so it would look much better shorter it harry 
 
 ohi dunno said harry slightly alarmed at being asked his opinion he slid away from them in the direction of fred and george who were huddled in a corner with mundungus 
 
 mundungus stopped talking when he saw harry but fred winked and beckoned harry closer 
 
 ok he told mundungus we can trust harry our financial backer 
 
 look what got us said george holding out his hand to harry it was full of what looked like shrivelled black pods a faint rattling noise was coming from them even though they were completely stationary 
 
 venomous tentacula seeds said george we need them for the skiving snackboxes but a class c substance so been having a bit of trouble getting hold of them 
 
 ten galleons the lot then dung said fred 
 
 wiv all the trouble i went to to get em said mundungus his saggy bloodshot eyes stretching even wider sorry lads but not taking a knut under twenty 
 
 dung likes his little joke fred said to harry 
 
 yeah his best one so far has been six sickles for a bag of knarl quills said george 
 
 be careful harry warned them quietly 
 
 what said fred busy cooing over prefect ron okay 
 
 but moody could have his eye on you harry pointed out 
 
 mundungus looked nervously over his shoulder 
 
 good point that he grunted all right lads ten it is if take em quick 
 
 cheers harry said fred delightedly when mundungus had emptied his pockets into the twins outstretched hands and scuttled off towards the food better get these upstairs 
 
 harry watched them go feeling slightly uneasy it had just occurred to him that mr and mrs weasley would want to know how fred and george were financing their joke shop business when as was inevitable they finally found out about it giving the twins his triwizard winnings had seemed a simple thing to do at the time but what if it led to another family row and a estrangement would mrs weasley still feel that harry was as good as her son if she found out he had made it possible for fred and george to start a career she thought quite unsuitable 
 
 standing where the twins had left him with nothing but a guilty weight in the pit of his stomach for company harry caught the sound of his own name kingsley deep voice was audible even over the surrounding chatter 
 
 why dumbledore make potter a prefect said kingsley 
 
 have had his reasons replied lupin 
 
 but it shown confidence in him what done persisted kingsley specially with the daily prophet having a go at him every few days 
 
 harry did not look round he did not want lupin or kingsley to know he had heard though not remotely hungry he followed mundungus back towards the table his pleasure in the party had evaporated as quickly as it had come he wished he were upstairs in bed 
 
 moody was sniffing at a chicken leg with what remained of his nose evidently he could not detect any trace of poison because he then tore a strip off it with his teeth 
 
 the made of spanish oak with varnish and vibration control ron was saying to tonks 
 
 mrs weasley yawned widely 
 
 well i think sort out that boggart before i turn in arthur i want this lot up too late all right night harry dear 
 
 she left the kitchen harry set down his plate and wondered whether he could follow her without attracting attention 
 
 you all right potter grunted moody 
 
 yeah fine lied harry 
 
 moody took a swig from his hipflask his eye staring sideways at harry 
 
 come here got something that might interest you he said 
 
 from an inner pocket of his robes moody pulled a very tattered old wizarding photograph 
 
 original order of the phoenix growled moody found it last night when i was looking for my spare invisibility cloak seeing as podmore had the manners to return my best one thought people might like to see it 
 
 harry took the photograph a small crowd of people some waving at him others lifting their glasses looked back up at him 
 
 me said moody unnecessarily pointing at himself the moody in the picture was unmistakeable though his hair was slightly less grey and his nose was intact and dumbledore beside me dedalus diggle on the other side marlene mckinnon she was killed two weeks after this was taken they got her whole family frank and alice longbottom 
 
 stomach already uncomfortable clenched as he looked at alice longbottom he knew her round friendly face very well even though he had never met her because she was the image of her son neville 
 
 poor devils growled moody better dead than what happened to them and emmeline vance met her and that lupin obviously benjy fenwick he copped it too we only ever found bits of him shift aside there he added poking the picture and the little photographic people edged sideways so that those who were partially obscured could move to the front 
 
 edgar bones brother of amelia bones they got him and his family too he was a great wizard sturgis podmore blimey he looks young caradoc dearborn vanished six months after this we never found his body hagrid of course looks exactly the same as ever elphias doge met him forgotten he used to wear that stupid hat gideon prewett it took five death eaters to kill him and his brother fabian they fought like heroes budge along budge along 
 
 the little people in the photograph jostled among themselves and those hidden right at the back appeared at the forefront of the picture 
 
 brother aberforth only time i ever met him strange bloke dorcas meadowes voldemort killed her personally sirius when he still had short hair and there you go thought that would interest you 
 
 heart turned over his mother and father were beaming up at him sitting on either side of a small man whom harry recognised at once as wormtail the one who had betrayed his parents whereabouts to voldemort and so helped to bring about their deaths 
 
 eh said moody 
 
 harry looked up into moody s heavily scarred and pitted face evidently moody was under the impression he had just given harry a bit of a treat 
 
 yeah said harry once again attempting to grin er listen just remembered i packed my 
 
 he was spared the trouble of inventing an object he had not packed sirius had just said that got there and moody had turned towards him harry crossed the kitchen slipped through the door and up the stairs before anyone could call him back 
 
 he did not know why it had been such a shock he had seen pictures of his parents before after all and he had met wormtail but to have them sprung on him like that when he was least expecting it no one would like that he thought angrily 
 
 and then to see them surrounded by all those other happy faces benjy fenwick who had been found in bits and gideon prewett who had died like a hero and the longbottoms who had been tortured into madness all waving happily out of the photograph forever more not knowing that they were doomed well moody might find that interesting he harry found it disturbing 
 
 harry tiptoed up the stairs in the hall past the stuffed glad to be on his own again but as he approached the first landing he heard noises someone was sobbing in the drawing room 
 
 hello harry said 
 
 there was no answer but the sobbing continued he climbed the remaining stairs two at a time walked across the landing and opened the door 
 
 someone was cowering against the dark wall her wand in her hand her whole body shaking with sobs sprawled on the dusty old carpet in a patch of moonlight clearly dead was ron 
 
 all the air seemed to vanish from lungs he felt as though he were falling through the floor his brain turned icy coldron dead no it be 
 
 but wait a moment it be ron was downstairs 
 
 mrs weasley harry croaked 
 
 mrs weasley sobbed pointing her shaking wand at body 
 
 crack 
 
 body turned into on his back his eyes wide open and empty mrs weasley sobbed harder than ever 
 
 she sobbed again 
 
 crack 
 
 mr body replaced his glasses askew a trickle of blood running down his face 
 
 no mrs weasley moaned no riddikulus riddikulus riddikulus 
 
 crack dead twins crack dead percy crack dead harry 
 
 mrs weasley just get out of here shouted harry staring down at his own dead body on the floor let someone else 
 
 going on 
 
 lupin had come running into the room closely followed by sirius with moody stumping along behind them lupin looked from mrs weasley to the dead harry on the floor and seemed to understand in an instant pulling out his own wand he said very firmly and clearly riddikulus 
 
 body vanished a silvery orb hung in the air over the spot where it had lain lupin waved his wand once more and the orb vanished in a puff of smoke 
 
 ohohoh gulped mrs weasley and she broke into a storm of crying her face in her hands 
 
 molly said lupin bleakly walking over to her molly 
 
 next second she was sobbing her heart out on shoulder 
 
 molly it was just a boggart he said soothingly patting her on the head just a stupid boggart 
 
 i see them all the time mrs weasley moaned into his shoulder all the i about it 
 
 sirius was staring at the patch of carpet where the boggart pretending to be body had lain moody was looking at harry who avoided his gaze he had a funny feeling magical eye had followed him all the way out of the kitchen 
 
 tell arthur mrs weasley was gulping now mopping her eyes frantically with her cuffs i want him to know being silly 
 
 lupin handed her a handkerchief and she blew her nose 
 
 harry so sorry what must you think of me she said shakily not even able to get rid of a boggart 
 
 be stupid said harry trying to smile 
 
 just worried she said tears spilling out of her eyes again half the in the order a miracle if we all come through this and not talking to us what if something happens and never it up with him and going to happen if arthur and i get killed to look after ron and ginny 
 
 molly enough said lupin firmly this like last time the order are better prepared got a head start we know what up to 
 
 mrs weasley gave a little squeak of fright at the sound of the name 
 
 oh molly come on about time you got used to hearing his namelook i promise no going to get hurt nobody can promise that but much better off than we were last time you in the order then you understand last time we were outnumbered twenty to one by the death eaters and they were picking us off one by one 
 
 harry thought of the photograph again of his parents beaming faces he knew moody was still watching him 
 
 worry about percy said sirius abruptly come round only a matter of time before voldemort moves into the open once he does the whole going to be begging us to forgive them and not sure be accepting their apology he added bitterly 
 
 and as for going to look after ron and ginny if you and arthur died said lupin smiling slightly what do you think do let them starve 
 
 mrs weasley smiled tremulously 
 
 being silly she muttered again mopping her eyes 
 
 but harry closing his bedroom door behind him some ten minutes later could not think mrs weasley silly he could still see his parents beaming up at him from the battered old photograph unaware that their lives like so many of those around them were drawing to a close the image of the boggart posing as the corpse of each member of mrs family in turn kept flashing before his eyes 
 
 without warning the scar on his forehead seared with pain again and his stomach churned horribly 
 
 cut it out he said firmly rubbing the scar as the pain receded 
 
 first sign of madness talking to your own head said a sly voice from the empty picture on the wall 
 
 harry ignored it he felt older than he had ever felt in his life and it seemed extraordinary to him that barely an hour ago he had been worried about a joke shop and who had got a badge 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix
