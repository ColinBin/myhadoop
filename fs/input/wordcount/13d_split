lionfish nov chapter thirteen dentention with delorescontents prev chapter next chapter 
 dinner in the great hall that night was not a pleasant experience for harry the news about his shouting match with umbridge had travelled exceptionally fast even by hogwarts standards he heard whispers all around him as he sat eating between ron and hermione the funny thing was that none of the whisperers seemed to mind him overhearing what they were saying about him on the contrary it was as though they were hoping he would get angry and start shouting again so that they could hear his story 
 
 he says he saw cedric diggory murdered 
 
 he reckons he duelled with 
 
 come off it 
 
 who does he think kidding 
 
 
 
 what i get said harry through clenched teeth laying down his knife and fork his hands were shaking too much to hold them steady is why they all believed the story two months ago when dumbledore told them 
 
 the thing is harry not sure they did said hermione grimly oh get out of here 
 
 she slammed down her own knife and fork ron looked longingly at his apple pie but followed suit people stared at them all the way out of the hall 
 
 what mean not sure they believed dumbledore harry asked hermione when they reached the landing 
 
 look you understand what it was like after it happened said hermione quietly you arrived back in the middle of the lawn clutching dead body none of us saw what what happened in the maze we just had word for it that had come back and killed cedric and fought you 
 
 which is the truth said harry loudly 
 
 i know it is harry so will you please stop biting my head off said hermione wearily just that before the truth could sink in everyone went home for the summer where they spent two months reading about how a nutcase and going senile 
 
 rain pounded on the windowpanes as they strode along the empty corridors back to gryffindor tower harry felt as though his first day had lasted a week but he still had a mountain of homework to do before bed a dull pounding pain was developing over his right eye he glanced out of a window at the dark grounds as they turned into the fat corridor there was still no light in cabin 
 
 mimbulus mimbletonia said hermione before the fat lady could ask the portrait swung open to reveal the hole behind it and the three of them scrambled through it 
 
 the common room was almost empty nearly everyone was still down at dinner crookshanks uncoiled himself from an armchair and trotted to meet them purring loudly and when harry ron and hermione took their three favourite chairs at the fireside he leapt lightly on to lap and curled up there like a furry ginger cushion harry gazed into the flames feeling drained and exhausted 
 
 how can dumbledore have let this happen hermione cried suddenly making harry and ron jump crookshanks leapt off her looking affronted she pounded the arms of her chair in fury so that bits of stuffing leaked out of the holes how can he let that terrible woman teach us and in our owl year too 
 
 well never had great defence against the dark arts teachers have we said harry you know what like hagrid told us nobody wants the job they say jinxed 
 
 yes but to employ someone actually refusing to let us do magic dumbledore playing at 
 
 and trying to get people to spy for her said ron darkly 
 
 remember when she said she wanted us to come and tell her if we hear anyone saying back 
 
 of course here to spy on us all obvious why else would fudge have wanted her to come snapped hermione 
 
 start arguing again said harry wearily as ron opened his mouth to retaliate we just just do that homework get it out of the way 
 
 they collected their schoolbags from a corner and returned to the chairs by the fire people were coming back from dinner now harry kept his face averted from the portrait hole but could still sense the stares he was attracting 
 
 shall we do stuff first said ron dipping his quill into his ink the properties of moonstone and its uses in he muttered writing the words across the top of his parchment as he spoke them there he underlined the title then looked up expectantly at hermione 
 
 so what are the properties of moonstone and its uses in 
 
 but hermione was not listening she was squinting over into the far corner of the room where fred george and lee jordan were now sitting at the centre of a knot of all of whom were chewing something that seemed to have come out of a large paper bag that fred was holding 
 
 no sorry gone too far she said standing up and looking positively furious come on ron 
 
 i what said ron plainly playing for time nocome on hermionewe tell them off for giving out sweets 
 
 you know perfectly well that those are bits of nosebleed nougat oror puking pastilles or 
 
 fainting fancies harry suggested quietly 
 
 one by one as though hit over the head with an invisible mallet the were slumping unconscious in their seats some slid right on to the floor others merely hung over the arms of their chairs their tongues lolling out most of the people watching were laughing hermione however squared her shoulders and marched directly over to where fred and george now stood with clipboards closely observing the unconscious ron rose halfway out of his chair hovered uncertainly for a moment or two then muttered to harry got it under control before sinking as low in his chair as his lanky frame permitted 
 
 enough hermione said forcefully to fred and george both of whom looked up in mild surprise 
 
 yeah right said george nodding this dosage looks strong enough it 
 
 i told you this morning you test your rubbish on students 
 
 paying them said fred indignantly 
 
 i care it could be dangerous 
 
 rubbish said fred 
 
 calm down hermione fine said lee reassuringly as he walked from to inserting purple sweets into their open mouths 
 
 yeah look coming round now said george 
 
 a few of the were indeed stirring several looked so shocked to find themselves lying on the floor or dangling off their chairs that harry was sure fred and george had not warned them what the sweets were going to do 
 
 feel all right said george kindly to a small girl lying at his feet 
 
 ii think so she said shakily 
 
 excellent said fred happily but the next second hermione had snatched both his clipboard and the paper bag of fainting fancies from his hands 
 
 it is not excellent 
 
 course it is alive they said fred angrily 
 
 you do this what if you made one of them really ill 
 
 not going to make them ill already tested them all on ourselves this is just to see if everyone reacts the same 
 
 if you stop doing it going to 
 
 put us in detention said fred in an voice 
 
 make us write lines said george smirking 
 
 onlookers all over the room were laughing hermione drew herself up to her full height her eyes were narrowed and her bushy hair seemed to crackle with electricity 
 
 no she said her voice quivering with anger but i will write to your mother 
 
 you said george horrified taking a step back from her 
 
 oh yes i would said hermione grimly i stop you eating the stupid things yourselves but not to give them to the 
 
 fred and george looked thunderstruck it was clear that as far as they were concerned threat was way below the belt with a last threatening look at them she thrust clipboard and the bag of fancies back into his arms and stalked back to her chair by the fire 
 
 ron was now so low in his seat that his nose was roughly level with his knees 
 
 thank you for your support ron hermione said acidly 
 
 you handled it fine by yourself ron mumbled 
 
 hermione stared down at her blank piece of parchment for a few seconds then said edgily oh no good i concentrate now going to bed 
 
 she wrenched her bag open harry thought she was about to put her books away but instead she pulled out two misshapen woolly objects placed them carefully on a table by the fireplace covered them with a few bits of parchment and a broken quill and stood back to admire the effect 
 
 what in the name of merlin are you doing said ron watching her as though fearful for her sanity 
 
 hats for she said briskly now stuffing her books back into her bag i did them over the summer a really slow knitter without magic but now back at school i should be able to make lots more 
 
 leaving out hats for the said ron slowly and covering them up with rubbish first 
 
 yes said hermione defiantly swinging her bag on to her back 
 
 not on said ron angrily trying to trick them into picking up the hats setting them free when they might not want to be free 
 
 of course they want to be free said hermione at once though her face was turning pink you dare touch those hats ron 
 
 she turned on her heel and left ron waited until she had disappeared through the door to the girls dormitories then cleared the rubbish off the woolly hats 
 
 they should at least see what picking up he said firmly anyway he rolled up the parchment on which he had written the title of essay no point trying to finish this now i do it without hermione i got a clue what supposed to do with moonstones have you 
 
 harry shook his head noticing as he did so that the ache in his right temple was getting worse he thought of the long essay on giant wars and the pain stabbed at him sharply knowing perfectly well that when the morning came he would regret not finishing his homework that night he piled his books back into his bag 
 
 going to bed too 
 
 he passed seamus on the way to the door leading to the dormitories but did not look at him harry had a fleeting impression that seamus had opened his mouth to speak but he sped up and reached the soothing peace of the stone spiral staircase without having to endure any more provocation 
 
 the following day dawned just as leaden and rainy as the previous one hagrid was still absent from the staff table at breakfast 
 
 but on the plus side no snape today said ron bracingly 
 
 hermione yawned widely and poured herself some coffee she looked mildly pleased about something and when ron asked her what she had to be so happy about she simply said the hats have gone seems the do want freedom after all 
 
 i bet on it ron told her cuttingly they might not count as clothes they look anything like hats to me more like woolly bladders 
 
 hermione did not speak to him all morning 
 
 double charms was succeeded by double transfiguration professor flitwick and professor mcgonagall both spent the first fifteen minutes of their lessons lecturing the class on the importance of owls 
 
 what you must remember said little professor flitwick squeakily perched as ever on a pile of books so that he could see over the top of his desk is that these examinations may influence your futures for many years to come if you have not already given serious thought to your careers now is the time to do so and in the meantime afraid we shall be working harder than ever to ensure that you all do yourselves justice 
 
 they then spent over an hour revising summoning charms which according to professor flitwick were bound to come up in their owl and he rounded off the lesson by setting them their largest ever amount of charms homework 
 
 it was the same if not worse in transfiguration 
 
 you cannot pass an owl said professor mcgonagall grimly without serious application practice and study i see no reason why everybody in this class should not achieve an owl in transfiguration as long as they put in the work neville made a sad little disbelieving noise yes you too longbottom said professor mcgonagall nothing wrong with your work except lack of confidence so today we are starting vanishing spells these are easier than conjuring spells which you would not usually attempt until newt level but they are still among the most difficult magic you will be tested on in your owl 
 
 she was quite right harry found the vanishing spells horribly difficult by the end of a double period neither he nor ron had managed to vanish the snails on which they were practising though ron said hopefully he thought his looked a bit paler hermione on the other hand successfully vanished her snail on the third attempt earning her a bonus for gryffindor from professor mcgonagall she was the only person not given homework everybody else was told to practise the spell overnight ready for a fresh attempt on their snails the following afternoon 
 
 now panicking slightly about the amount of homework they had to do harry and ron spent their lunch hour in the library looking up the uses of moonstones in still angry about slur on her woolly hats hermione did not join them by the time they reached care of magical creatures in the afternoon head was aching again 
 
 the day had become cool and breezy and as they walked down the sloping lawn towards cabin on the edge of the forbidden forest they felt the occasional drop of rain on their faces professor stood waiting for the class some ten yards from front door a long trestle table in front of her laden with twigs as harry and ron reached her a loud shout of laughter sounded behind them turning they saw draco malfoy striding towards them surrounded by his usual gang of slytherin cronies he had clearly just said something highly amusing because crabbe goyle pansy parkinson and the rest continued to snigger heartily as they gathered around the trestle table and judging by the way they all kept looking over at harry he was able to guess the subject of the joke without too much difficulty 
 
 everyone here barked professor once all the slytherins and gryffindors had arrived crack on then who can tell me what these things are called 
 
 she indicated the heap of twigs in front of her hand shot into the air behind her back malfoy did a imitation of her jumping up and down in eagerness to answer a question pansy parkinson gave a shriek of laughter that turned almost at once into a scream as the twigs on the table leapt into the air and revealed themselves to be what looked like tiny creatures made of wood each with knobbly brown arms and legs two twiglike fingers at the end of each hand and a funny flat barklike face in which a pair of eyes glittered 
 
 oooooh said parvati and lavender thoroughly irritating harry anyone would have thought hagrid had never shown them impressive creatures admittedly the flobberworms had been a bit dull but the salamanders and hippogriffs had been interesting enough and the skrewts perhaps too much so 
 
 kindly keep your voices down girls said professor sharply scattering a handful of what looked like brown rice among the who immediately fell upon the food soanyone know the names of these creatures miss granger 
 
 bowtruckles said hermione usually live in 
 
 five points for gryffindor said professor yes these are bowtruckles and as miss granger rightly says they generally live in trees whose wood is of wand quality anybody know what they eat 
 
 woodlice said hermione promptly which explained why what harry had taken to be grains of brown rice were moving but fairy eggs if they can get them 
 
 good girl take another five points so whenever you need leaves or wood from a tree in which a bowtruckle lodges it is wise to have a gift of woodlice ready to distract or placate it they may not look dangerous but if angered they will try to gouge at human eyes with their fingers which as you can see are very sharp and not at all desirable near the eyeballs so if like to gather closer take a few woodlice and a bowtrucklei have enough here for one between threeyou can study them more closely i want a sketch from each of you with all labelled by the end of the lesson 
 
 the class surged forwards around the trestle table harry deliberately circled around the back so that he ended up right next to professor 
 
 hagrid he asked her while everyone else was choosing bowtruckles 
 
 never you mind said professor repressively which had been her attitude last time hagrid had failed to turn up for a class too smirking all over his pointed face draco malfoy leaned across harry and seized the largest bowtruckle 
 
 maybe said malfoy in an undertone so that only harry could hear him the stupid great got himself badly injured 
 
 maybe you will if you shut up said harry out of the side of his mouth 
 
 maybe been messing with stuff too big for him if you get my drift 
 
 malfoy walked away smirking over his shoulder at harry who felt suddenly sick did malfoy know something his father was a death eater after all what if he had information about fate that had not yet reached the ears of the order he hurried back around the table to ron and hermione who were squatting on the grass some distance away and attempting to persuade a bowtruckle to remain still long enough for them to draw it harry pulled out parchment and quill crouched down beside the others and related in a whisper what malfoy had just said 
 
 dumbledore would know if something had happened to hagrid said hermione at once just playing into hands to look worried it tells him we know exactly going on got to ignore him harry here hold the bowtruckle for a moment just so i can draw its face 
 
 yes came clear drawl from the group nearest them father was talking to the minister just a couple of days ago you know and it sounds as though the really determined to crack down on teaching in this place so even if that overgrown moron does show up again probably be sent packing straightaway 
 
 ouch 
 
 harry had gripped the bowtruckle so hard that it had almost snapped and it had just taken a great retaliatory swipe at his hand with its sharp fingers leaving two long deep cuts there harry dropped it crabbe and goyle who had already been guffawing at the idea of hagrid being sacked laughed still harder as the bowtruckle set off at full tilt towards the forest a little moving soon swallowed up among the tree roots when the bell echoed distantly over the grounds harry rolled up his bowtruckle picture and marched off to herbology with his hand wrapped in handkerchief and derisive laughter still ringing in his ears 
 
 if he calls hagrid a moron one more time said harry through gritted teeth 
 
 harry go picking a row with malfoy forget a prefect now he could make life difficult for you 
 
 wow i wonder what be like to have a difficult life said harry sarcastically ron laughed but hermione frowned together they traipsed across the vegetable patch the sky still appeared unable to make up its mind whether it wanted to rain or not 
 
 i just wish hagrid would hurry up and get back all said harry in a low voice as they reached the greenhouses and say that a better teacher he added threateningly 
 
 i going to said hermione calmly 
 
 because never be as good as hagrid said harry firmly fully aware that he had just experienced an exemplary care of magical creatures lesson and was thoroughly annoyed about it 
 
 the door of the nearest greenhouse opened and some spilled out of it including ginny 
 
 hi she said brightly as she passed a few seconds later luna lovegood emerged trailing behind the rest of the class a smudge of earth on her nose and her hair tied in a knot on the top of her head when she saw harry her prominent eyes seemed to bulge excitedly and she made a beeline straight for him many of his classmates turned curiously to watch luna took a great breath and then said without so much as a preliminary hello i believe he who must not be named is back and i believe you fought him and escaped from him 
 
 erright said harry awkwardly luna was wearing what looked like a pair of orange radishes for earrings a fact that parvati and lavender seemed to have noticed as they were both giggling and pointing at her earlobes 
 
 you can laugh luna said her voice rising apparently under the impression that parvati and lavender were laughing at what she had said rather than what she was wearing but people used to believe there were no such things as the blibbering humdinger or the snorkack 
 
 well they were right they said hermione impatiently there any such things as the blibbering humdinger or the snorkack 
 
 luna gave her a withering look and flounced away radishes swinging madly parvati and lavender were not the only ones hooting with laughter now 
 
 mind not offending the only people who believe me harry asked hermione as they made their way into class 
 
 oh for sake harry you can do better than her said hermione told me all about her apparently only believe in things as long as no proof at all well i expect anything else from someone whose father runs the quibbler 
 
 harry thought of the sinister winged horses he had seen on the night he had arrived and how luna had said she could see them too his spirits sank slightly had she been lying but before he could devote much more thought to the matter ernie macmillan had stepped up to him 
 
 i want you to know potter he said in a loud carrying voice that not only weirdos who support you i personally believe you one hundred per cent my family have always stood firm behind dumbledore and so do i 
 
 erthanks very much ernie said harry taken aback but pleased ernie might be pompous on occasions like this but harry was in a mood to deeply appreciate a vote of confidence from somebody who did not have radishes dangling from their ears words had certainly wiped the smile from lavender browns face and as he turned to talk to ron and hermione harry caught expression which looked both confused and defiant 
 
 to surprise professor sprout started their lesson by lecturing them about the importance of owls harry wished all the teachers would stop doing this he was starting to get an anxious twisted feeling in his stomach every time he remembered how much homework he had to do a feeling that worsened dramatically when professor sprout gave them yet another essay at the end of class tired and smelling strongly of dragon dung professor sprouts preferred type of fertiliser the gryffindors trooped back up to the castle an hour and a half later none of them talking very much it had been another long day 
 
 as harry was starving and he had his first detention with umbridge at five he headed straight for dinner without dropping off his bag in gryffindor tower so that he could bolt something down before facing whatever she had in store for him he had barely reached the entrance of the great hall however when a loud and angry voice yelled oi potter 
 
 what now he muttered wearily turning to face angelina johnson who looked as though she was in a towering temper 
 
 tell you what now she said marching straight up to him and poking him hard in the chest with her finger how come landed yourself in detention for five on friday 
 
 what said harry why oh yeah keeper tryouts 
 
 now he remembers snarled angelina i tell you i wanted to do a tryout with the whole team and find someone who fitted in with i tell you booked the quidditch pitch specially and now decided not going to be there 
 
 i decide not to be there said harry stung by the injustice of these words i got detention from that umbridge woman just because i told her the truth about 
 
 well you can just go straight to her and ask her to let you off en friday said angelina fiercely and i care how you do it tell her a figment of your imagination if you like just make sure there 
 
 she turned on her heel and stormed away 
 
 you know what harry said to ron and hermione as they entered the great hall i think better check with puddlemere united whether oliver been killed during a training session because angelina seems to be channelling his spirit 
 
 what reckon are the odds of umbridge letting you off on friday said ron sceptically as they sat down at the gryffindor table 
 
 less than zero said harry glumly tipping lamb chops on to his plate and starting to eat better try though i offer to do two more detentions or something i dunno he swallowed a mouthful of potato and added i hope she keep me too long this evening you realise got to write three essays practise vanishing spells for mcgonagall work out a for flitwick finish the bowtruckle drawing and start that stupid dream diary for trelawney 
 
 ron moaned and for some reason glanced up at the ceiling 
 
 and it looks like going to rain 
 
 that got to do with our homework said hermione her eyebrows raised 
 
 nothing said ron at once his ears reddening 
 
 at five to five harry bade the other two goodbye and set off for office on the third floor when he knocked on the door she called come in in a sugary voice he entered cautiously looking around 
 
 he had known this office under three of its previous occupants 
 
 in the days when gilderoy lockhart had lived here it had been plastered in beaming portraits of himself when lupin had occupied it it was likely you would meet some fascinating dark creature in a cage or tank if you came to call in the impostor days it had been packed with various instruments and artefacts for the detection of wrongdoing and concealment 
 
 now however it looked totally unrecognisable the surfaces had all been draped in lacy covers and cloths there were several vases full of dried flowers each one residing on its own doily and on one of the walls was a collection of ornamental plates each decorated with a large technicolour kitten wearing a different bow around its neck these were so foul that harry stared at them transfixed until professor umbridge spoke again 
 
 good evening mr potter 
 
 harry started and looked around he had not noticed her at first because she was wearing a luridly flowered set of robes that blended only too well with the tablecloth on the desk behind her 
 
 evening professor umbridge harry said stiffly 
 
 well sit down she said pointing towards a small table draped in lace beside which she had drawn up a chair a piece of blank parchment lay on the table apparently waiting for him 
 
 er said harry without moving professor umbridge erbefore we start ii wanted to ask you a a favour 
 
 her bulging eyes narrowed 
 
 oh yes 
 
 well in the gryffindor quidditch team and i was supposed to be at the tryouts for the new keeper at five on friday and i waswas wondering whether i could skip detention that night and do itdo it another night instead 
 
 he knew long before he reached the end of his sentence that it was no good 
 
 oh no said umbridge smiling so widely that she looked as though she had just swallowed a particularly juicy fly oh no no no this is your punishment for spreading evil nasty stories mr potter and punishments certainly cannot be adjusted to suit the guilty convenience no you will come here at five tomorrow and the next day and on friday too and you will do your detentions as planned i think it rather a good thing that you are missing something you really want to do it ought to reinforce the lesson i am trying to teach you 
 
 harry felt the blood surge to his head and heard a thumping noise in his ears so he told evil nasty stones did he 
 
 she was watching him with her head slightly to one side still smiling widely as though she knew exactly what he was thinking and was waiting to see whether he would start shouting again with a massive effort harry looked away from her dropped his schoolbag beside the chair and sat down 
 
 there said umbridge sweetly getting better at controlling our temper already we now you are going to be doing some lines for me mr potter no not with your quill she added as harry bent down to open his bag going to be using a rather special one of mine here you are 
 
 she handed him a long thin black quill with an unusually sharp point 
 
 i want you to write i must not tell lies she told him softly 
 
 how many times harry asked with a creditable imitation of politeness 
 
 oh as long as it takes for the message to sink in said umbridge sweetly off you go 
 
 she moved over to her desk sat down and bent over a stack of parchment that looked like essays for marking harry raised the sharp black quill then realised what was missing 
 
 you given me any ink he said 
 
 oh you need ink said professor umbridge with the merest suggestion of a laugh in her voice 
 
 harry placed the point of the quill on the paper and wrote i must not tell lies 
 
 he let out a gasp of pain the words had appeared on the parchment in what appeared to be shining red ink at the same time the words had appeared on the back of right hand cut into his skin as though traced there by a scalpel yet even as he stared at the shining cut the skin healed over again leaving the place where it had been slightly redder than before but quite smooth 
 
 harry looked round at umbridge she was watching him her wide toadlike mouth stretched in a smile 
 
 yes 
 
 nothing said harry quietly 
 
 he looked back at the parchment placed the quill on it once more wrote i must not tell lies and felt the searing pain on the back of his hand for a second time once again the words had been cut into his skin once again they healed over seconds later 
 
 and on it went again and again harry wrote the words on the parchment in what he soon came to realise was not ink but his own blood and again and again the words were cut into the back of his hand healed and reappeared the next time he set quill to parchment 
 
 darkness fell outside window harry did not ask when he would be allowed to stop he did not even check his watch he knew she was watching him for signs of weakness and he was not going to show any not even if he had to sit there all night cutting open his own hand with this quill 
 
 come here she said after what seemed hours 
 
 he stood up his hand was stinging painfully when he looked down at it he saw that the cut had healed but that the skin there was red raw 
 
 hand she said 
 
 he extended it she took it in her own harry repressed a shudder as she touched him with her thick stubby fingers on which she wore a number of ugly old rings 
 
 tut tut i seem to have made much of an impression yet she said smiling well just have to try again tomorrow evening we you may go 
 
 harry left her office without a word the school was quite deserted it was surely past midnight he walked slowly up the corridor then when he had turned the corner and was sure she would not hear him broke into a run 
 
 he had not had time to practise vanishing spells had not written a single dream in his dream diary and had not finished the drawing of the bowtruckle nor had he written his essays he skipped breakfast next morning to scribble down a couple of dreams for divination their first lesson and was surprised to find a dishevelled ron keeping him company 
 
 how come you do it last night harry asked as ron stared wildly around the common room for inspiration ron who had been fast asleep when harry got back to the dormitory muttered something about doing other stuff bent low over his parchment and scrawled a few words 
 
 have to do he said slamming the diary shut said i dreamed i was buying a new pair of shoes she make anything weird out of that can she 
 
 they hurried off to north tower together 
 
 how was detention with umbridge anyway what did she make you do 
 
 harry hesitated for a fraction of a second then said lines 
 
 not too bad then eh said ron 
 
 nope said harry 
 
 heyi forgot did she let you off for friday 
 
 no said harry 
 
 ron groaned sympathetically 
 
 it was another bad day for harry he was one of the worst in transfiguration not having practised vanishing spells at all he had to give up his lunch hour to complete the picture of the bowtruckle and meanwhile professors mcgonagall and sinistra gave them yet more homework which he had no prospect of finishing that evening because of his second detention with umbridge to cap it all angelina johnson tracked him down at dinner again and on learning that he would not be able to attend keeper tryouts told him she was not at all impressed by his attitude and that she expected players who wished to remain on the team to put training before their other commitments 
 
 in detention harry yelled after her as she stalked away think rather be stuck in a room with that old toad or playing quidditch 
 
 at least only lines said hermione consolingly as harry sank back on to his bench and looked down at his steak and kidney pie which he no longer fancied very much not as it a dreadful punishment really 
 
 harry opened his mouth closed it again and nodded he was not really sure why he was not telling ron and hermione exactly what was happening in room he only knew that he did not want to see their looks of horror that would make the whole thing seem worse and therefore more difficult to face he also felt dimly that this was between himself and umbridge a private battle of wills and he was not going to give her the satisfaction of hearing that he had complained about it 
 
 i believe how much homework got said ron miserably 
 
 well why you do any last night hermione asked him where were you anyway 
 
 i was i fancied a walk said ron shiftily 
 
 harry had the distinct impression that he was not alone in concealing things at the moment 
 
 the second detention was just as bad as the previous one the skin on the back of hand became irritated more quickly now and was soon red and inflamed harry thought it unlikely that it would keep healing as effectively for long soon the cut would remain etched into his hand and umbridge would perhaps be satisfied he let no gasp of pain escape him however and from the moment of entering the room to the moment of his dismissal again past midnight he said nothing but good evening and goodnight 
 
 his homework situation however was now desperate and when he returned to the gryffindor common room he did not though exhausted go to bed but opened his books and began moonstone essay it was half past two by the time he had finished it he knew he had done a poor job but there was no help for it unless he had something to give in he would be in detention with snape next he then dashed off answers to the questions professor mcgonagall had set them cobbled together something on the proper handling of bowtruckles for professor and staggered up to bed where he fell fully clothed on top of the covers and fell asleep immediately 
 
 thursday passed in a haze of tiredness ron seemed very sleepy too though harry could not see why he should be third detention passed in the same way as the previous two except that after two hours the words i must not tell lies did not fade from the back of hand but remained scratched there oozing droplets of blood the pause in the pointed quills scratching made professor umbridge look up 
 
 ah she said softly moving around her desk to examine his hand herself good that ought to serve as a reminder to you it you may leave for tonight 
 
 do i still have to come back tomorrow said harry picking up his schoolbag with his left hand rather than his smarting right one 
 
 oh yes said professor umbridge smiling as widely as before yes i think we can etch the message a little deeper with another evenings work 
 
 harry had never before considered the possibility that there might be another teacher in the world he hated more than snape but as he walked back towards gryffindor tower he had to admit he had found a strong contender evil he thought as he climbed a staircase to the seventh floor an evil twisted mad old 
 
 ron 
 
 he had reached the top of the stairs turned right and almost walked into ron who was lurking behind a statue of lachlan the lanky clutching his broomstick he gave a great leap of surprise when he saw harry and attempted to hide his new cleansweep eleven behind his back 
 
 what are you doing 
 
 ernothing what are you doing 
 
 harry frowned at him 
 
 come on you can tell me what are you hiding here for 
 
 hiding from fred and george if you must know said ron they just went past with a bunch of i bet testing stuff on them again i mean they do it in the common room now can they not with hermione there 
 
 he was talking in a very fast feverish way 
 
 but what have you got your broom for you been flying have you harry asked 
 
 iwellwell ok tell you but laugh all right ron said defensively turning redder with every second ii thought try out for gryffindor keeper now got a decent broom there go on laugh 
 
 not laughing said harry ron blinked a brilliant idea be really cool if you got on the team never seen you play keeper are you good 
 
 not bad said ron who looked immensely relieved at reaction charlie fred and george always made me keep for them when they were training during the holidays 
 
 so been practising tonight 
 
 every evening since tuesday just on my own though been trying to bewitch quaffles to fly at me but it been easy and i know how much use be ron looked nervous and anxious fred and george are going to laugh themselves stupid when i turn up for the tryouts they stopped taking the mickey out of me since i got made a prefect 
 
 i wish i was going to be there said harry bitterly as they set off together towards the common room 
 
 yeah so do harry that on the back of your hand 
 
 harry who had just scratched his nose with his free right hand tried to hide it but had as much success as ron with his cleansweep 
 
 just a cut 
 
 but ron had grabbed forearm and pulled the back of hand up level with his eyes there was a pause during which he stared at the words carved into the skin then looking sick he released harry 
 
 i thought you said she was just giving you lines 
 
 harry hesitated but after all ron had been honest with him so he told ron the truth about the hours he had been spending in office 
 
 the old hag ron said in a revolted whisper as they came to a halt in front of the fat lady who was dozing peacefully with her head against her frame sick go to mcgonagall say something 
 
 no said harry at once not giving her the satisfaction of knowing got to me 
 
 got to let her get away with this 
 
 i know how much power got over her said harry 
 
 dumbledore then tell dumbledore 
 
 no said harry flatly 
 
 why not 
 
 got enough on his mind said harry but that was not the true reason he was not going to go to dumbledore for help when dumbledore had not spoken to him once since june 
 
 well i reckon you should ron began but he was interrupted by the fat lady who had been watching them sleepily and now burst out are you going to give me the password or will i have to stay awake all night waiting for you to finish your conversation 
 
 friday dawned sullen and sodden as the rest of the week though harry automatically glanced towards the staff table when he entered the great hall it was without any real hope of seeing hagrid and he turned his mind immediately to his more pressing problems such as the mountainous pile of homework he had to do and the prospect of yet another detention with umbridge 
 
 two things sustained harry that day one was the thought that it was almost the weekend the other was that dreadful though his final detention with umbridge was sure to be he had a distant view of the quidditch pitch from her window and might with luck be able to see something of tryout these were rather feeble rays of light it was true but harry was grateful for anything that might lighten his present darkness he had never had a worse first week of term at hogwarts 
 
 at five that evening he knocked on professor office door for what he sincerely hoped would be the final time and was told to enter the blank parchment lay ready for him on the table the pointed black quill beside it 
 
 you know what to do mr potter said umbridge smiling sweetly at him 
 
 harry picked up the quill and glanced through the window if he just shifted his chair an inch or so to the right on the pretext of shifting himself closer to the table he managed it he now had a distant view of the gryffindor quidditch team soaring up and down the pitch while half a dozen black figures stood at the foot of the three high goalposts apparently awaiting their turn to keep it was impossible to tell which one was ron at this distance 
 
 i must not tell wrote the cut in the back of his right hand opened and began to bleed afresh 
 
 i must not tell cut dug deeper stinging and smarting 
 
 i must not tell trickled down his wrist 
 
 he chanced another glance out of the window whoever was defending the goalposts now was doing a very poor job indeed katie bell scored twice in the few seconds harry dared to watch hoping very much that the keeper ron he dropped his eyes back to the parchment shining with blood 
 
 i must not tell lies 
 
 i must not tell lies 
 
 he looked up whenever he thought he could risk it when he could hear the scratching of quill or the opening of a desk drawer the third person to try out was pretty good the fourth was terrible the fifth dodged a bludger exceptionally well but then fumbled an easy save the sky was darkening and harry doubted he would be able to see the sixth and seventh people at all 
 
 i must not tell lies 
 
 i must not tell lies 
 
 the parchment was now dotted with drops of blood from the back of his hand which was searing with pain when he next looked up night had fallen and the quidditch pitch was no longer visible 
 
 see if got the message yet shall we said soft voice half an hour later 
 
 she moved towards him stretching out her short ringed fingers for his arm and then as she took hold of him to examine the words now cut into his skin pain seared not across the back of his hand but across the scar on his forehead at the same time he had a most peculiar sensation somewhere around his midriff 
 
 he wrenched his arm out of her grip and leapt to his feet staring at her she looked back at him a smile stretching her wide slack mouth 
 
 yes it hurts it she said softly 
 
 he did not answer his heart was thumping very hard and fast was she talking about his hand or did she know what he had just felt in his forehead 
 
 well i think made my point mr potter you may go 
 
 he caught up his schoolbag and left the room as quickly as he could 
 
 stay calm he told himself as he sprinted up the stairs stay calm it necessarily mean what you think it means 
 
 mimbulus mimbletonia he gasped at the fat lady who swung forwards once more 
 
 a roar of sound greeted him ron came running towards him beaming all over his face and slopping butterbeer down his front from the goblet he was clutching 
 
 harry i did it in keeper 
 
 what oh brilliant said harry trying to smile naturally while his heart continued to race and his hand throbbed and bled 
 
 have a butterbeer ron pressed a bottle on him i believe hermione gone 
 
 there said fred who was also swigging butterbeer and pointed to an armchair by the fire hermione was dozing in it her drink tipping precariously in her hand 
 
 well she said she was pleased when i told her said ron looking slightly put out 
 
 let her sleep said george hastily it was a few moments before harry noticed that several of the gathered around them bore unmistakeable signs of recent nosebleeds 
 
 come here ron and see if old robes fit you called kade bell we can take off his name and put yours on instead 
 
 as ron moved away angelina came striding up to harry 
 
 sorry i was a bit short with you earlier potter she said abruptly stressful this managing lark you know starting to think i was a bit hard on wood sometimes she was watching ron over the rim of her goblet with a slight frown on her face 
 
 look i know your best mate but not fabulous she said bluntly i think with a bit of training be all right though he comes from a family of good quidditch players banking on him turning out to have a bit more talent than he showed today to be honest vicky frobisher and geoffrey hooper both flew better this evening but a real whiner always moaning about something or other and involved in all sorts of societies she admitted herself that if training clashed with her charms club put charms first anyway having a practice session at two tomorrow so just make sure there this time and do me a favour and help ron as much as you can ok 
 
 he nodded and angelina strolled back to alicia spinnet harry moved over to sit next to hermione who awoke with a jerk as he put down his bag 
 
 oh harry you good about ron it she said blearily just sososo tired she yawned i was up until one making more hats disappearing like mad 
 
 and sure enough now that he looked harry saw that there were woolly hats concealed all around the room where unwary elves might accidentally pick them up 
 
 great said harry distractedly if he did not tell somebody soon he would burst listen hermione i was just up in office and she touched my arm 
 
 hermione listened closely when harry had finished she said slowly worried controlling her like he controlled quirrell 
 
 well said harry dropping his voice a possibility it 
 
 i suppose so said hermione though she sounded unconvinced but i think he can be possessing her the way he possessed quirrell i mean properly alive again now he got his own body he need to share someone he could have her under the imperius curse i suppose 
 
 harry watched fred george and lee jordan juggling empty butterbeer bottles for a moment then hermione said but last year your scar hurt when nobody was touching you and dumbledore say it had to do with what was feeling at the time i mean maybe this got anything to do with umbridge at all maybe just coincidence it happened while you were with her 
 
 evil said harry flatly twisted 
 
 horrible yes but harry i think you ought to tell dumbledore your scar hurt 
 
 it was the second time in two days he had been advised to go to dumbledore and his answer to hermione was just the same as his answer to ron 
 
 not bothering him with this like you just said not a big deal been hurting on and off all summerit was just a bit worse tonight all 
 
 harry sure dumbledore would want to be bothered by this 
 
 yeah said harry before he could stop himself the only bit of me dumbledore cares about it my scar 
 
 say that not true 
 
 i think write and tell sirius about it see what he thinks 
 
 harry you put something like that in a letter said hermione looking alarmed you remember moody told us to be careful what we put in writing we just guarantee owls being intercepted any more 
 
 all right all right i tell him then said harry irritably he got to his feet going to bed tell ron for me will you 
 
 oh no said hermione looking relieved if going that means i can go too without being rude absolutely exhausted and i want to make some more hats tomorrow listen you can help me if you like quite fun getting better i can do patterns and bobbles and all sorts of things now 
 
 harry looked into her face which was shining with glee and tried to look as though he was vaguely tempted by this offer 
 
 er no i think i will thanks he said ernot tomorrow got loads of homework to do 
 
 and he traipsed off to the boys stairs leaving her looking slightly disappointed 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix
