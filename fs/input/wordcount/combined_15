lionfish nov chapter thirty the sacking of severus snapecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 the moment her finger touched the mark harrys scar burned savagely the starry room vanished from sight and he was standing upon an outcrop of rock beneath a cliff and the sea was washing around him and there was a triumph in his heart c they have the boy 
 
 a loud bang brought harry back to where he stood disoriented he raised his wand but the witch before him was already falling forward she hit the ground so hard that the glass in the bookcases tinkled 
 
 ive never stunned anyone except in our lessons said luna sounding mildly interested that was noisier than i though it would be 
 
 and sure enough the ceiling had begun to tremble scurrying echoing footsteps were growing louder from behind the door leading to the dormitories lunas spell had woken ravenclaws sleeping above 
 
 luna where are you i need to get under the cloak 
 
 lunas feet appeared out of nowhere he hurried to her side and she let the cloak fall back over them as the door opened and a stream of ravenclaws all in their nightclothes flooded into the common room there were gasps and cries of surprise as they saw alecto lying there unconscious slowly they shuffled in around her a savage beast that might wake at any moment and attack them then one brave little darted up to her and prodded her backside with his big toe 
 
 i think she might be dead he shouted with delight 
 
 oh look whispered luna happily as the ravenclaws crowded in around alecto theyre pleased 
 
 yeah great 
 
 harry closed his eyes and as his scar throbbed he chose to sink again into voldemorts mind he was moving along the tunnel into the first cave he had chosen to make sure of the locker before comingbut that would not take him long 
 
 there was a rap on the common room door and every ravenclaw froze from the other side harry heard the soft musical voice that issued from the eagle door knocker where do vanished objects go 
 
 i dunno do i shut it snarled an uncouth voice that harry knew was that of the carrow brother amycus alecto alecto are you there have you got him open the door 
 
 the ravenclaws were whispering amongst themselves terrified then without warning there came a series of loud bangs as though somebody was firing a gun into the door 
 
 alecto if he comes and we havent got potter c dyou want to go the same way as the malfoys answer me amycus bellowed shaking the door for all he was worth but still it did not open the ravenclaws were all backing away and some of the most frightened began scampering back up the stair case to their beds then just as harry was wondering whether he ought not to blast open the door and stun amycus before the death eater could do anything else a second most familiar voice rang out beyond the door 
 
 may i ask what you are doing professor carrow 
 
 trying c to getc through this damned c door shouted amycus go and get flitwick get him to open it now 
 
 but isnt your sister in there asked professor mcgonagall didnt professor flitwick let her in earlier this evening at your urgent request perhaps she could open the door for you then you neednt wake up half the castle 
 
 she aint answering you old besom you open it darn do it now 
 
 certainly if you wish it said professor mcgonagall with awful coldness there was a genteel tap of the knocker and the musical voice asked again 
 
 where do vanished objects go 
 
 into non being which is to say everything replied professor mcgonagall 
 
 nicely phrased replied the eagle door knocker and the door swung open 
 
 the few ravenclaws who had remained behind sprinted for the stairs as amycus burst over the threshold brandishing his wand hunched like his sister he had a pallid doughy face and tiny eyes which fell at once on alecto sprawled motionless on the floor he let out a yell of fury and fear 
 
 whatve they done the little whelps he screamed ill cruciate the lot of em till they tell me who did it c and whats the dark lord going to say he shrieked standing over his sister and smacking himself on the forehead with his fist we havent got him and theyve gone and killed her 
 
 shes only stunned said professor mcgonagall impatiently who had stooped down to examine alecto shell be perfectly all right 
 
 no she bludgering well wont bellowed amycus not after the dark lord gets hold of her shes gone and sent for him i felt me mark burn and he thinks weve got potter 
 
 got potter said professor mcgonagall sharply what do you mean got potter 
 
 he told us potter might try and get inside ravenclaw tower and to send for him if we caught him 
 
 why would harry potter try to get inside ravenclaw tower potter belongs in my house 
 
 beneath the disbelief and anger harry heard a little strain of pride in her voice and affection for minerva mcgonagall gushed up inside him 
 
 we was told he might come in here said carrow i dunno why do i 
 
 professor mcgonagall stood up and her beady eyes swept the room twice they passed right over the place where harry and luna stood 
 
 we can push it off on the kids said amycus his pig like face suddenly crafty yeah thats what well do well say alecto was ambushed by the kids them kids up there c he looked up at the starry ceiling toward the dormitories c and well say they forced her to pres her mark and thats why he got a false alarm he can punish them couple of kids more or less whats the difference 
 
 only the difference between truth and lie courage and cowardice said professor mcgonagall who had turned pale a difference in short which you and your sister seem unable to appreciate but let me make one thing very clear you are not going to pass off your many ineptitudes on the students of hogwarts i shall not permit it 
 
 excuse me 
 
 amycus moved forward until he was offensively close to professor mcgonagall his face within inches of hers she refused to back away but looked down at him as if he were something disgusting she had found stuck to the lavatory seat 
 
 its not a case of what youll permit minerva mcgonagall your times over its us whats in charge here now and youll back me up or youll pay the price 
 
 and he spat in her face 
 
 harry pulled the cloak off himself raised his wand and said you shouldnt have done that 
 
 as amycus spun around harry shouted crucio 
 
 the death eater was lifted off his feet he writhed through the air like a drowning man thrashing and howling in pain and then with a crunch and a shattering of glass he smashed into the front of a bookcase and crumpled insensible to the floor i see what bellatrix meant said harry the blood thundering through his brain you need to really mean it 
 
 potter whispered professor mcgonagall clutching her heart potter c youre here whatc howc she struggled to pull herself together potter that was foolish 
 
 he spat at you said harry 
 
 potter i c that was very c gallant of you c but dont you realize c 
 
 yeah i do harry assured her somehow her panic steadied him professor mcgonagall voldemorts on the way 
 
 oh are we allowed to say the name now asked luna with an air of interest pulling off the invisibility cloak the appearance of a second outlaw seemed to overwhelm professor mcgonagall who staggered backward and fell into a nearby chair clutching at the neck of her old tartan dressing gown 
 
 i dont think it makes any difference what we call him harry told luna he already knows where i am 
 
 in a distant part of harrys brain that part connected to the angry burning scar he could see voldemort sailing fast over the dark lake in the ghostly green boat he had nearly reached the island where the stone basin stood 
 
 you must flee whispered professor mcgonagall now potter as quickly as you can 
 
 i cant said harry theres something i need to do professor so you know where the diadem of ravenclaw is 
 
 the of ravenclaw of course not c hasnt it been lost for centuries she sat up a little straighter potter it was madness utter madness for you to enter this castlec 
 
 i had to said harry professor theres something hidden here that im supposed to find and it could be the diademc if i could just speak to professor flitwickc 
 
 there was a sound of movement of clinking glass amycus was coming round before harry or luna could act professor mcgonagall rose to her feet pointed her wand at the groggy death eater and said imperio 
 
 amycus got up walked over to his sister picked up her wand then shuffled obediently to professor mcgonagall and handed it over along with his own then he lay down on the floor beside alecto professor mcgonagall waved her wand again and a length of shimmering silver rope appeared out of thin air and snaked around the carrows binding them tightly together 
 
 potter said professor mcgonagall turning to face him again with superb indifference to the carrows predicament if does indeed know that you are herec 
 
 as she said it a wrath that was like physical pain blazed through harry setting his scar on fire and for a second he looked down upon a basin whose potion had turned clear and saw that no golden locket lay safe beneath the surfacec 
 
 potter are you all right said a voice and harry came back he was clutching lunas shoulder to steady himself 
 
 times running out voldemorts getting nearer professor im acting on dumbledores orders i must find what he wanted me to find but weve got to get the students out while im searching the castle c its me voldemort wants but he wont care about killing a few more or less not nowc not now he knows im attacking horcruxes harry finished the sentence in his head 
 
 youre acting on dumbledores orders she repeated with a look of dawning wonder then she drew herself up to her fullest height 
 
 we shall secure the school against while you search for this c this object 
 
 is that possible 
 
 i think so said professor mcgonagall dryly we teachers are rather good at magic you know i am sure we will be able to hold him off for a while if we all put our best efforts into it of course something will have to be done about professor snapec 
 
 let me c 
 
 cand if hogwarts is about to enter a state of siege with the dark lord at the gates it would indeed be advisable to take as many innocent people out of the way as possible with the floo network under observation and apparition impossible within the groundsc 
 
 theres a way said harry quickly and he explained about the passageway leading into the hogs head 
 
 potter were talking about hundreds of studentsc 
 
 i know professor but if voldemort and the death eaters are concentrating on the school boundaries they wont be interested in anyone whos disapparating out of hogs head 
 
 theres something in that she agreed she pointed her wand at the carrows and a silver net fell upon their bound bodies tied itself around them and hoisted them into the air where they dangled beneath the ceiling like two large ugly sea creatures come we must alert the other heads of house youd better put that cloak back on 
 
 she marched toward the door and as she did so she raised her wand from the tip burst three silver cats with spectacle markings around their eyes the patronuses ran sleekly ahead filling the spiral staircase with silvery light as professor mcgonagall harry and luna hurried back down 
 
 along the corridors they raced and one by one the patronuses left them professor mcgonagalls tartan dressing gown rustled over the floor and harry and luna jogged behind her under the cloak 
 
 they had descended two more floors when another set of quiet joined theirs harry whose scar was still prickling heard them first he felt in the pouch around his neck for the marauders map but before he could take it our mcgonagall too seemed to become aware of their company she halted raised her wand ready to duel and said whos there 
 
 it is i said a low voice 
 
 from behind a suit of armor stepped severus snape 
 
 hatred boiled up in harry at the sight of him he had forgotten the details of snapes appearance in the magnitude of his crimes forgotten how his greasy black hair hung in curtains around his thin face how his black eyes had a dead cold look he was not wearing nightclothes but was dressed in his usual black cloak and he too was holding his wand ready for a fight 
 
 where are the carrows he asked quietly 
 
 wherever you told them to be i expect severus said professor mcgonagall 
 
 snape stepped nearer and his eyes flitted over professor mcgonagall into the air around her as if he knew that harry was there harry held his wand up too ready to attack 
 
 i was under the impression said snape that alecto had apprehended an intruder 
 
 really said professor mcgonagall and what gave you that impression 
 
 snape mad a slight flexing movement of his left arm where the dark mark was branded into his skin 
 
 oh but naturally said professor mcgonagall you death eaters have your own private means of communication i forgot 
 
 snape pretended not to have heard her his eyes were still probing the air all about her and he was moving gradually closer with an air of hardly noticing what he was doing 
 
 i did not know that it was your night to patrol the corridors minerva 
 
 you have some objection 
 
 i wonder what could have brought you out of our bed at this late hour 
 
 i thought i heard a disturbance said professor mcgonagall 
 
 really but all seems calm 
 
 snape looked into her eyes 
 
 have you seen harry potter minerva because if you have i must insistc 
 
 professor mcgonagall moved faster than harry could have believed her wand slashed through the air and for a split second harry thought that snape must crumple unconscious but the swiftness of his shield charm was such that mcgonagall was thrown off balance she brandished her wand at a touch on the wall and it flew out of its bracket harry about to curse snape was forced to pull luna out of the way of the descending flames which became a ring of fire that filled the corridor and flew like a lasso at snapec then it was no longer fire but a great black serpent that mcgonagall blasted to smoke which and solidified in seconds to become a swarm of pursuing daggers snape avoided them only by forcing the suit of armor in front of him and with echoing clangs the daggers sank one after another into its breastc 
 
 minerva said a squeaky voice and looking behind him still shielding luna from flying spells harry saw professors flitwick and sprout sprinting up the corridor toward them in their nightclothes with the enormous professor slughorn panting along at the rear 
 
 no squealed flitwick raising his wand youll do no more murder at hogwarts 
 
 flitwicks spell hit the suit of armor behind which snape had taken shelter with a clatter it came to life snape struggled free of the crushing arms and sent it flying back toward his attackers harry and luna had to dive sideways to avoid it as it smashed into the wall and shattered when harry looked up again snape was in full flight mcgonagall flitwick and sprout all thundering after him he hurtled through a classroom door and moments later he heard mcgonagall cry coward coward 
 
 whats happened whats happened asked luna 
 
 harry dragged her to her feet and they raced along the corridor trailing the invisibility cloak behind them into the deserted classroom where professors mcgonagall flitwick and sprout were standing at a smashed window 
 
 he jumped said professor mcgonagall as harry and luna ran into the room 
 
 you mean hes dead harry sprinted to the window ignoring flitwicks and sprouts yells of shock at his sudden appearance 
 
 no hes not dead said mcgonagall bitterly unlike dumbledore he was still carrying a wand and he seems to have learned a few tricks from his master 
 
 with a tingle of horror harry saw in the distance a huge bat like shape flying through the darkness toward the perimeter wall 
 
 there were heavy footfalls behind them and a great deal of puffing slughorn had just caught up 
 
 harry he panted massaging his immense chest beneath his silk pajamas my dear boy what a surpriseminerva do please explainseveruswhat 
 
 our headmaster is taking a short break said professor mcgonagall pointing at the hole in the window 
 
 professor harry shouted his hand on his forehead he could see the lake sliding beneath him and he felt a ghostly green boat bump into the underground shore and voldemort lept from it with murder in his heartc 
 
 professor weve got to barricade the school hes coming now 
 
 very well is coming she told the other teachers sprout and flitwick gasped slughorn let out a low groan potter has work to do in the castle on dumbledores orders we need to put in place every protection of which we are capable while potter does what he needs to do 
 
 you realize of course that nothing we do will be able to keep out indefinitely squeaked flitwick 
 
 but we can hold him up said professor sprout 
 
 thank you pomona said professor mcgonagall and between the two witches there passed a look of grim understanding 
 
 i suggest we establish basic protection around the place then gather our students and meet in the great hall most must be evacuated though if any of those who are over age wish to stay and fight i think they ought to be given the chance 
 
 agreed said professor sprout already hurrying toward the door i shall meet you in the great hall in twenty minutes with my house 
 
 and as she jogged out of sight they could hear her muttering tentacula devils snare and snargaluff podsyes id like to see the death eaters fighting those 
 
 i can act from here said flitwick and although he could barely see out of it he pointed his wand through the smashed window and started muttering incantations of great complexity harry heard a weird rushing noise as though flitwick had unleashed the power of the wind into the grounds 
 
 professor harry said approaching the little charms master professor im sorry to interrupt but this is important have you got any idea where the diadem of ravenclaw is 
 
 cprotego horribillis c the diadem of ravenclaw squeaked flitwick a little extra wisdom never goes amiss potter but i hardly think it would be much use in this situation 
 
 i only meant c do you know where it is have you ever seen it 
 
 seen it nobody has seen it in living memory long since lost boy 
 
 harry felt a mixture of desperate disappointment and panic what then was the horcrux 
 
 we shall meet you and your ravenclaws in the great hall filius said professor mcgonagall beckoning to harry and luna to follow her 
 
 they had just reached the door when slughorn rumbled into speech 
 
 my word he puffed pale and sweaty his walrus mustache aquiver what a im not at all sure whether this is wise minerva he is bound to find a way in you know and anyone who has tried to delay him will be in the most grievous perilc 
 
 i shall expect you and the slytherins in the great hall in twenty minutes also said professor mcgonagall if you wish to leave with your students we shall not stop you but if any of you attempt to sabotage our resistance or take up arms against us within this castle then horace we duel to kill 
 
 minerva he said aghast 
 
 the time has come for slytherin house to decide upon its loyalties interrupted professor mcgonagall go and wake your students horace 
 
 harry did not stay to watch slughorn splutter he and luna stayed after professor mcgonagall who had taken up a position in the middle of the corridor and raised her wand 
 
 piertotumcoh for heavens sake filch not nowc 
 
 the aged caretaker had just come hobbling into view shouting students out of bed students in the corridors 
 
 theyre supposed to be you blithering idiot shouted mcgonagall now go and do something constructive find peeves 
 
 stammered filch as though he had never heard the name before 
 
 yes peeves you fool peeves havent you been complaining about him for a quarter of a century go and fetch him at once 
 
 filch evidently thought professor mcgonagall had taken leave of her senses but hobbled away muttering under his breath 
 
 and now c piertotum locomator cried professor mcgonagall and all along the corridor the statues and suits of armor jumped down from their plinths and from the echoing crashes from the floors above and below harry knew that their fellows throughout the castle had done the same 
 
 hogwarts is threatened shouted professor mcgonagall man the boundaries protect us do your duty to our school 
 
 clattering and yelling the horde of moving statues stampeded past harry some of them smaller others larger than life there were animals too and the clanking suits of armor brandished swords and spiked balls on chains 
 
 now potter said mcgonagall you and miss lovegood had better return to your friends and bring them to the great hall c i shall rouse the other gryffindors 
 
 they parted at the top of the next staircase harry and luna turning back toward the concealed entrance to the room of requirement as they ran they met crowds of students most wearing traveling cloaks over their pajamas being shepherded down to the great hall by teachers and prefects 
 
 that was potter 
 
 harry potter 
 
 it was him i swear i just saw him 
 
 but harry did not look back and at last they reached the entrance to the room of requirement harry leaned against the enchanted wall which opened to admit them and he and luna sped back down the steep staircase 
 
 whc 
 
 as the room came into view harry slipped down a few stairs in shock it was packed far more crowded than when he had last been in there kingsley and lupin were looking up at him as were oliver wood katie bell angelina johnson and alicia spinnet bill and fleur and mr and mrs weasley 
 
 harry whats happening said lupin meeting him at the foot of the stairs 
 
 voldemorts on his way theyre barricading he school c snapes run for it c what are you doing here how did you know 
 
 we sent messages to the rest of dumbledores army fred explained you couldnt expect everyone to miss the fun harry and the let the order of the phoenix know and it all kind of snowballed 
 
 what first harry called george whats going on 
 
 theyre evacuating the younger kids and everyones meeting in the great hall to get organized harry said were fighting 
 
 there was a great roar and a surge toward the stairs he was pressed back against he wall as they ran past hi the mingled members of the order of the phoenix dumbledores army and harrys old quidditch team all with their wands drawn heading up into the main castle 
 
 come on luna dean called as he passed holding out his free hand she took it and followed him back up the stairs 
 
 the crowd was thinning only a little knot of people remained below in the room of requirement and harry joined them mrs weasley was struggling with ginny around them stood lupin fred george bill and fleur 
 
 youre underage mrs weasley shouted at her daughter as harry approached i wont permit it the boys yes but you youve got to go home 
 
 i wont 
 
 ginnys hair flew as she pulled her arm out of her mothers grip 
 
 im in dumbledores armyc 
 
 a teenagers gang 
 
 a teenagers gang thats about to take him on which no one else has dared to do said fred 
 
 shes sixteen shouted mrs weasley shes not old enough what you two were thinking bringing her with you c c 
 
 fred and george looked slightly ashamed of themselves 
 
 moms right ginny said bill gently you cant do this everyone underage will have to leave its only right 
 
 i cant go home ginny shouted angry tears sparkling in her eyes my whole familys here i cant stand waiting there alone and not knowing and c 
 
 her eyes met harrys for the first time she looked at him beseechingly but he shook his head and she turned away bitterly 
 
 fine she said staring at the entrance to the tunnel back to the hogs head ill say now then andc 
 
 there was a scuffling and a great thump someone else had clambered out of the tunnel overbalanced slightly and fallen he pulled himself up no the nearest chair looked around through lopsided glasses and said am i too late has it started i only just found out so i c i c 
 
 percy spluttered into silence evidently he had not expected to run into most of his family there was a long moment of astonishment broken by fleur turning to lupin and saying in a wildly transparent attempt to break the tension soc ow eez leetle teddy 
 
 lupin blinked at her startled the silence between the weasleys seemed to be solidifying like ice 
 
 i c oh yes c hes fine lupin said loudly yes tonks is with him c at her mothers c 
 
 percy and the other weasleys were still staring at one another frozen 
 
 here ive got a picture lupin shouted pulling a photograph from inside his jacket and showing it to fleur and harry who saw a tiny baby with a tuft of bright turquoise hair waving fat fists at the camera 
 
 i was a fool percy roared so loudly that lupin nearly dropped his photograph i was an idiot i was a pompous prat i was a c a c 
 
 moron said fred 
 
 percy swallowed 
 
 yes i was 
 
 well you cant say fairer than that said fred holding his hand out to percy 
 
 mrs weasley burst into tears she ran forward pushed fred aside and pulled percy into a strangling hug while he patted her on the back his eyes on his father 
 
 im sorry dad percy said 
 
 mr weasley blinked rather rapidly then he too hurried to hug his son 
 
 what made you see sense perce inquired george 
 
 its been coming on for a while said percy mopping his eyes under his glasses with a corner of his traveling cloak but i had to find a way out and its not so easy at the ministry theyre imprisoning traitors all the time i managed to make contact with aberforth and he tipped me off ten minutes ago that hogwarts was going to make a fight of it so here i am 
 
 well we do look to our prefects to take a lead at times such as these said george in a good imitation of percys most pompous manner now lets get upstairs and fight or all the good death eatersll be taken 
 
 so youre my sister now said percy shaking hands with fleur as they hurried off toward the staircase with bill fred and george 
 
 ginny barked mrs weasley 
 
 ginny had been attempting under cover of the reconciliations to sneak upstairs too 
 
 molly how about this said lupin why doesnt ginny stay here then at least shell be on the scene and know whats going on but she wont be in the middle of the fighting 
 
 ic 
 
 thats a good idea said mr weasley firmly ginny you stay in this room you hear me 
 
 ginny did not seem to like the idea much but under her fathers unusually stern gaze she nodded mr and mrs weasley and lupin headed off to the stairs as well 
 
 wheres ron asked harry wheres hermione 
 
 they must have gone up the great hall already mr weasley called over his shoulder 
 
 i didnt see them pass me said harry 
 
 they said something about a bathroom said ginny not long after you left 
 
 a bathroom 
 
 harry strode across the room to an open door leading off the room of requirement and checked the bathroom beyond it was empty 
 
 youre sure they said bathc 
 
 but then his scar seared and the room of vanished he was looking through the high gates with winged boats on pillars at either side looking through the dark grounds toward the castle which was ablaze with lights nagini lay draped over his shoulders he was possessed of that cold cruel sense of purpose that preceded murder 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the deathly hallows 
 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 soup from a sausage skewer 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 we had such an excellent dinner yesterday said an old mouse 
 of the female sex to another who had not been present at the feast i 
 sat number below the which was not a bad place 
 
 shall i tell you what we had everything was first rate mouldy bread 
 tallow candle and sausage and then when we had finished that 
 course the same came on all over again it was as good as two feasts 
 
 we were very sociable and there was as much joking and fun as if we had been all of one family circle nothing was left but the sausage 
 skewers and this formed a subject of conversation till at last it 
 turned to the proverb soup from sausage skins or as the people in 
 the neighboring country call it soup from a sausage skewer every 
 one had heard the proverb but no one had ever tasted the soup much less prepared it a capital toast was drunk to the inventor of the 
 soup and some one said he ought to be made a relieving officer to the poor was not that witty then the old rose and promised that the young who should learn how best to prepare this and savory soup should be his queen and a year and a day should be allowed for the purpose 
 
 that was not at all a bad proposal said the other mouse but 
 how is the soup made 
 
 ah that is more than i can tell you all the young lady mice 
 were asking the same question they wished very much to be queen 
 but they did not want to take the trouble of going out into the 
 world to learn how to make soup which was absolutely necessary to 
 be done first but it is not every one who would care to leave her 
 family or her happy corner by the at home even to be 
 made queen it is not always easy to find bacon and in 
 foreign lands every day and it is not pleasant to have to endure 
 hunger and be perhaps after all eaten up alive by the cat 
 
 most probably some such thoughts as these discouraged the 
 majority from going out into the world to collect the required 
 information only four mice gave notice that they were ready to set 
 out on the journey they were young and lively but poor each of them wished to visit one of the four divisions of the world so that it 
 might be seen which was the most favored by fortune every one took a sausage skewer as a staff and to remind them of the 
 object of their journey they left home early in may and none of them returned till the first of may in the following year and then only 
 three of them nothing was seen or heard of the fourth although the 
 day of decision was close at hand ah yes there is always some 
 trouble mixed up with the greatest pleasure said the but 
 he gave orders that all the mice within a circle of many miles 
 should be invited at once they were to assemble in the kitchen and 
 the three travelled mice were to stand in a row before them while a 
 sausage skewer covered with crape was to be stuck up instead of 
 the missing mouse no one dared to express an opinion until the king 
 spoke and desired one of them to go on with her story and now we 
 shall hear what she said 
 
 what the first little mouse 
 saw and heard on her travels 
 when i first went out into the world said the little mouse 
 i fancied as so many of my age do that i already knew everything 
 but it was not so it takes years to acquire great knowledge i went 
 at once to sea in a ship bound for the north i had been told that the 
 cook must know how to prepare every dish at sea and it is easy enough to do that with plenty of sides of bacon and large tubs of salt meat and mouldy flour there i found plenty of delicate food but no opportunity for learning how to make soup from a sausage skewer we sailed on for many days and nights the ship rocked fearfully and we did not escape without a wetting as soon as we arrived at the port to which the ship was bound i left it and went on shore at a place far towards the north it is a wonderful thing to leave your own little corner at home to hide yourself in a ship where there are sure to be some nice snug corners for shelter then suddenly to find yourself thousands of miles away in a foreign land i saw large 
 pathless forests of pine and birch trees which smelt so strong that i 
 sneezed and thought of sausage there were great lakes also which 
 looked as black as ink at a distance but were quite clear when i came 
 close to them large swans were floating upon them and i thought at 
 first they were only foam they lay so still but when i saw them walk 
 and fly i knew what they were directly they belong to the goose 
 species one can see that by their walk no one can attempt to 
 disguise family descent i kept with my own kind and associated 
 with the forest and field mice who however knew very little 
 especially about what i wanted to know and which had actually made me travel abroad the idea that soup could be made from a sausage 
 skewer was to them such an unlikely thought that it 
 was repeated from one to another through the whole forest they 
 declared that the problem would never be solved that the thing was an impossibility how little i thought that in this place on the very 
 first night i should be initiated into the manner of its preparation 
 it was the height of summer which the mice told me was the 
 reason that the forest smelt so strong and that the herbs were so 
 fragrant and the lakes with the white swimming swans so dark and yet so clear on the margin of the wood near to three or four houses a pole as large as the mainmast of a ship had been erected and from 
 the summit hung wreaths of flowers and fluttering ribbons it was 
 the maypole lads and lasses danced round the pole and tried to outdo the violins of the musicians with their singing they were as merry as ever at sunset and in the moonlight but i took no part in the 
 what has a little mouse to do with a maypole dance i 
 sat in the soft moss and held my sausage skewer tight the moon threw its beams particularly on one spot where stood a tree covered with exceedingly fine moss i may almost venture to say that it was as fine and soft as the fur of the but it was green which is a 
 color very agreeable to the eye all at once i saw the most charming 
 little people marching towards me they did not reach higher than my 
 knee they looked like human beings but were better proportioned and they called themselves elves their clothes were very delicate and 
 fine for they were made of the leaves of flowers trimmed with the 
 wings of flies and gnats which had not a bad effect by their manner 
 it appeared as if they were seeking for something i knew not what 
 till at last one of them espied me and came towards me and the 
 foremost pointed to my sausage skewer and said there that is 
 just what we want see it is pointed at the top is it not capital and the longer he looked at my staff the more delighted he became i will lend it to you said i but not to keep 
 
 oh no we keep it they all cried and then they seized 
 the skewer which i gave up to them and danced with it to the spot 
 where the delicate moss grew and set it up in the middle of the 
 green they wanted a maypole and the one they now had seemed cut 
 out on purpose for them then they decorated it so beautifully that it 
 was quite dazzling to look at little spiders spun golden threads 
 around it and then it was hung with fluttering veils and flags so 
 delicately white that they glittered like snow in the moonshine after 
 that they took colors from the wing and sprinkled them 
 over the white drapery which gleamed as if covered with flowers and 
 diamonds so that i could not recognize my sausage skewer at all 
 such a maypole had never been seen in all the world as this then came a great company of real elves nothing could be finer than their 
 clothes and they invited me to be present at the feast but i was 
 to keep at a certain distance because i was too large for them 
 
 then commenced such music that it sounded like a thousand glass bells and was so full and strong that i thought it must be the song of the swans i fancied also that i heard the voices of the cuckoo and the 
 and it seemed at last as if the whole forest sent forth 
 glorious melodies the voices of children the tinkling of bells 
 and the songs of the birds and all this wonderful melody came from 
 the elfin maypole my sausage peg was a complete peal of bells i 
 could scarcely believe that so much could have been produced from 
 it till i remembered into what hands it had fallen i was so much 
 affected that i wept tears such as a little mouse can weep but they 
 were tears of joy the night was far too short for me there are no 
 long nights there in summer as we often have in this part of the 
 world when the morning dawned and the gentle breeze rippled the 
 glassy mirror of the forest lake all the delicate veils and flags 
 fluttered away into thin air the waving garlands of the web 
 the hanging bridges and galleries or whatever else they may be 
 called vanished away as if they had never been six elves brought 
 me back my sausage skewer and at the same time asked me to make any request which they would grant if in their power so i begged them if they could to tell me how to make soup from a sausage skewer 
 
 how do we make it said the chief of the elves with a smile 
 
 why you have just seen it you scarcely knew your sausage skewer 
 again i am sure 
 
 they think themselves very wise thought i to myself then i told 
 them all about it and why i had travelled so far and also what 
 promise had been made at home to the one who should discover the 
 method of preparing this soup what use will it be i asked to the 
 or to our whole mighty kingdom that i have seen all these 
 beautiful things i cannot shake the sausage peg and say look here 
 is the skewer and now the soup will come that would only produce a dish to be served when people were keeping a fast 
 
 then the elf dipped his finger into the cup of a violet and said 
 to me look here i will anoint your staff so that when 
 you return to your own home and enter the castle you have only to touch the king with your staff and violets will spring forth and 
 cover the whole of it even in the coldest winter time so i think i 
 have given you really something to carry home and a little more 
 than something 
 
 but before the little mouse explained what this something more 
 was she stretched her staff out to the king and as it touched him 
 the most beautiful bunch of violets sprang forth and filled the 
 place with perfume the smell was so powerful that the 
 ordered the mice who stood nearest the chimney to thrust their tails 
 into the fire that there might be a smell of burning for the perfume 
 of the violets was overpowering and not the sort of scent that 
 every one liked 
 
 but what was the something more of which you spoke just now 
 asked the 
 
 why answered the little mouse i think it is what they call 
 effect and thereupon she turned the staff round and behold not 
 a single flower was to be seen upon it she now only held the naked 
 skewer and lifted it up as a conductor lifts his baton at a 
 concert violets the elf told me continued the mouse are for the 
 sight the smell and the touch so we have only now to produce the 
 effect of hearing and tasting and then as the little mouse beat 
 time with her staff there came sounds of music not such music as was heard in the forest at the elfin feast but such as is often heard in 
 the kitchen the sounds of boiling and roasting it came quite 
 suddenly like wind rushing through the chimneys and seemed as if 
 every pot and kettle were boiling over the clattered down 
 on the brass fender and then quite as suddenly all was still 
 nothing could be heard but the light vapory song of the 
 which was quite wonderful to hear for no one could rightly 
 distinguish whether the kettle was just beginning to boil or going 
 to stop and the little pot steamed and the great pot simmered but 
 without any regard for each indeed there seemed no sense in the 
 pots at all and as the little mouse waved her baton still more 
 wildly the pots foamed and threw up bubbles and boiled over while 
 again the wind roared and whistled through the chimney and at last 
 there was such a terrible hubbub that the little mouse let her 
 stick fall 
 
 that is a strange sort of soup said the shall we 
 not now hear about the preparation 
 
 that is all answered the little mouse with a bow 
 
 that all said the then we shall be glad to hear 
 what information the next may have to give us 
 
 what the second mouse had to tell 
 i was born in the library at a castle said the second mouse 
 very few members of our family ever had the good fortune to get 
 into the much less the on my journey and 
 here are the only times i have ever seen a kitchen we were 
 often obliged to suffer hunger in the library but then we gained a 
 great deal of knowledge the rumor reached us of the royal prize 
 offered to those who should be able to make soup from a sausage 
 skewer then my old grandmother sought out a manuscript which 
 however she could not read but had heard it read and in it was 
 written those who are poets can make soup of sausage skewers 
 she then asked me if i was a poet i felt myself quite innocent of any 
 such pretensions then she said i must go out and make myself a 
 poet i asked again what i should be required to do for it seemed 
 to me quite as difficult as to find out how to make soup of a 
 sausage skewer my grandmother had heard a great deal of reading in 
 her day and she told me three principal qualifications were 
 necessary understanding imagination and feeling if you can manage to acquire these three you will be a poet and the soup will be quite easy to you 
 
 so i went forth into the world and turned my steps towards the 
 west that i might become a poet understanding is the most 
 important matter in everything i knew that for the two other 
 qualifications are not thought much of so i went first to seek for 
 understanding where was i to find it go to the ant and learn 
 wisdom said the great jewish king i knew that from living in a 
 library so i went straight on till i came to the first great 
 and then i set myself to watch that i might become wise 
 the ants are a very respectable people they are wisdom itself all 
 they do is like the working of a sum in arithmetic which comes right 
 to work and to lay eggs say they and to provide for posterity 
 is to live out your time properly and that they truly do they are 
 divided into the clean and the dirty ants their rank is pointed out 
 by a number and the is number one and her opinion is the only correct one on everything she seems to have the whole wisdom of the world in her which was just the important matter i wished to acquire she said a great deal which was no doubt very clever yet to me it sounded like nonsense she said the was the loftiest thing in the world and yet close to the mound stood a tall tree which no one could deny was loftier much loftier but no mention was made of the tree one evening an ant lost herself on this tree she had crept up the stem not nearly to the top but higher than 
 any ant had ever ventured and when at last she returned home she said that she had found something in her travels much higher than the 
 the rest of the ants considered this an insult to the 
 whole community so she was condemned to wear a muzzle and to live in perpetual solitude a short time afterwards another ant got on 
 the tree and made the same journey and the same discovery but she 
 spoke of it cautiously and indefinitely and as she was one of the 
 superior ants and very much respected they believed her and when she died they erected an eggshell as a monument to her memory for they cultivated a great respect for science i saw said the little mouse that the ants were always running to and fro with her burdens on their backs once i saw one of them drop her load she gave herself a great deal of trouble in trying to raise it again but she could not succeed then two others came up and tried with all their strength 
 to help her till they nearly dropped their own burdens in doing so 
 then they were obliged to stop for a moment in their help for every 
 one must think of himself first and the remarked that their 
 conduct that day showed that they possessed kind hearts and good 
 understanding these two qualities she continued place us ants in 
 the highest degree above all other reasonable beings understanding 
 must therefore be seen among us in the most prominent manner and my wisdom is greater than all and so saying she raised herself on her two hind legs that no one else might be mistaken for her i could not therefore make an error so i ate her up we are to go to the ants 
 to learn wisdom and i had got the queen 
 
 i now turned and went nearer to the lofty tree already mentioned 
 which was an oak it had a tall trunk with a top and 
 was very old i knew that a living being dwelt here a dryad as she is 
 called who is born with the tree and dies with it i had heard this 
 in the library and here was just such a tree and in it an she uttered a terrible scream when she caught sight of me so near to her like many women she was very much afraid of mice and she had more real cause for fear than they have for i might have gnawed through the tree on which her life depended i spoke to her in a kind and friendly manner and begged her to take courage 
 
 at last she took me up in her delicate hand and then i told her 
 what had brought me out into the world and she promised me that 
 perhaps on that very evening she should be able to obtain for me one 
 of the two treasures for which i was seeking she told me that 
 phantaesus was her very dear friend that he was as beautiful as the 
 god of love that he remained often for many hours with her under 
 the leafy boughs of the tree which then rustled and waved more than 
 ever over them both he called her his dryad she said and the tree 
 his tree for the grand old oak with its gnarled trunk was just to 
 his taste the root spreading deep into the earth the top rising 
 high in the fresh air knew the value of the drifted snow the keen 
 wind and the warm sunshine as it ought to be known yes continued the dryad the birds sing up above in the branches and talk to each other about the beautiful fields they have visited in foreign 
 lands and on one of the withered boughs a stork has built his 
 nest it is beautifully arranged and besides it is pleasant to 
 hear a little about the land of the pyramids all this pleases 
 phantaesus but it is not enough for him i am obliged to relate to 
 him of my life in the woods and to go back to my childhood when i 
 was little and the tree so small and delicate that a could overshadow it and i have to tell everything that has happened since then till now that the tree is so large and strong sit you down now under the green bindwood and pay attention when phantaesus comes i will find an opportunity to lay hold of his wing and to pull out one of the little feathers that feather you shall have a better was never given to any poet it will be quite enough for you 
 
 and when phantaesus came the feather was plucked and said 
 the little mouse i seized and put it in water and kept it there 
 till it was quite soft it was very heavy and indigestible but i 
 managed to nibble it up at last it is not so easy to nibble 
 self into a poet there are so many things to get through now 
 however i had two of them understanding and imagination and through these i knew that the third was to be found in the library a great man has said and written that there are novels whose sole and only use appeared to be that they might relieve mankind of overflowing tears a kind of sponge in fact for sucking up feelings and emotions i remembered a few of these books they had always appeared tempting to the appetite they had been much read and were so greasy that they must have absorbed no end of emotions in themselves i retraced my steps to the library and literally devoured a whole novel that is properly speaking the interior or soft part of it the crust or binding i left when i had digested not only this but a second i felt a stirring within me then i ate a small piece of a third 
 romance and felt myself a poet i said it to myself and told others the same i had and and i cannot tell what 
 aches besides i thought over all the stories that may be said to be 
 connected with sausage pegs and all that has ever been written 
 about skewers and sticks and staves and splinters came to my 
 thoughts the must have had a wonderfully clear 
 understanding i remembered the man who placed a white stick in his 
 mouth by which he could make himself and the stick invisible i 
 thought of sticks as staves of music or rhyme of 
 breaking a stick over a back and heaven knows how many more phrases of the same sort relating to sticks staves and skewers 
 
 all my thoughts rein on skewers sticks of wood and staves and as 
 i am at last a poet and i have worked terribly hard to make 
 myself one i can of course make poetry on anything i shall therefore 
 be able to wait upon you every day in the week with a poetical history 
 of a skewer and that is my soup 
 
 in that case said the we will hear what the 
 third mouse has to say 
 
 squeak squeak cried a little mouse at the kitchen door it was 
 the fourth and not the third of the four who were contending for the 
 prize one whom the rest supposed to be dead she shot in like an 
 arrow and overturned the sausage peg that had been covered with 
 crape she had been running day and night she had watched an 
 opportunity to get into a goods train and had travelled by the 
 railway and yet she had arrived almost too late she pressed forward 
 looking very much ruffled she had lost her sausage skewer but not 
 her voice for she began to speak at once as if they only waited for 
 her and would hear her only and as if nothing else in the world 
 was of the least consequence she spoke out so clearly and plainly 
 and she had come in so suddenly that no one had time to stop her or 
 to say a word while she was speaking and now let us hear what she 
 said 
 
 what the fourth mouse who spoke 
 before the third had to tell 
 i started off at once to the largest town said she but the 
 name of it has escaped me i have a very bad memory for names i was carried from the railway with some forfeited goods to the jail 
 and on arriving i made my escape and ran into the house of the 
 turnkey the turnkey was speaking of his prisoners especially of 
 one who had uttered thoughtless words these words had given rise to other words and at length they were written down and registered 
 the whole affair is like making soup of sausage skewers said he but the soup may cost him his neck 
 
 now this raised in me an interest for the prisoner continued 
 the little mouse and i watched my opportunity and slipped into 
 his apartment for there is a to be found behind every 
 closed door the prisoner looked pale he had a great beard and large sparkling eyes there was a lamp burning but the walls were so 
 black that they only looked the blacker for it the prisoner scratched 
 pictures and verses with white chalk on the black walls but i did not 
 read the verses i think he found his confinement wearisome so that i 
 was a welcome guest he enticed me with with 
 whistling and with gentle words and seemed so friendly towards me 
 that by degrees i gained confidence in him and we became friends 
 he divided his bread and water with me gave me cheese and sausage 
 and i really began to love him altogether i must own that it was a 
 very pleasant intimacy he let me run about on his hand and on his 
 arm and into his sleeve and i even crept into his beard and he 
 called me his little friend i forgot what i had come out into the 
 world for forgot my sausage skewer which i had laid in a crack in the 
 floor it is lying there still i wished to stay with him always where 
 i was for i knew that if i went away the poor prisoner would have 
 no one to be his friend which is a sad thing i stayed but he did 
 not he spoke to me so mournfully for the last time gave me double as much bread and cheese as usual and kissed his hand to me then he went away and never came back i know nothing more of his history 
 
 the jailer took possession of me now he said something about 
 soup from a sausage skewer but i could not trust him he took me in 
 his hand certainly but it was to place me in a cage like a oh how dreadful it was i had to run round and round without getting any farther in advance and only to make everybody laugh the was a charming little thing she had curly hair like the brightest gold merry eyes and such a smiling mouth 
 
 you poor little mouse said she one day as she peeped into 
 my cage i will set you free she then drew forth the iron 
 fastening and i sprang out on the and from thence to the 
 roof free free that was all i could think of not of the object 
 of my journey it grew dark and as night was coming on i found a 
 lodging in an old tower where dwelt a watchman and an owl i had no confidence in either of them least of all in the owl which is like a 
 cat and has a great failing for she eats mice one may however be 
 mistaken sometimes and so was i for this was a respectable and 
 old owl who knew more than the watchman and even as much as i did myself the young owls made a great fuss about 
 everything but the only rough words she would say to them were 
 you had better go and make some soup from sausage skewers she was very indulgent and loving to her children her conduct gave me such confidence in her that from the crack where i sat i called out 
 squeak this confidence of mine pleased her so much that she assured me she would take me under her own protection and that not a creature should do me harm the fact was she wickedly meant to keep me in reserve for her own eating in winter when food would be scarce yet she was a very clever she explained to me that the watchman could only hoot with the horn that hung loose at his side and then she said he is so terribly proud of it that he imagines 
 himself an owl in the tower wants to do great things but only 
 succeeds in small all soup on a sausage skewer then i begged the owl to give me the recipe for this soup soup from a sausage skewer said she is only a proverb amongst mankind and may be understood in many ways each believes his own way the best and after all the proverb signifies nothing nothing i exclaimed i was quite struck truth is not always agreeable but truth is above everything else as the old owl said i thought over all this and saw quite plainly that if truth was really so far above everything else it must be much more valuable than soup from a sausage skewer so i hastened to get away that i might be home in time and bring what was highest and best and above everything namely the truth the mice are an enlightened people and the is above them all he is therefore capable of making me queen for the sake of truth 
 
 your truth is a falsehood said the mouse who had not yet 
 spoken i can prepare the soup and i mean to do so 
 
 how it was prepared 
 i did not travel said the third mouse i stayed in this 
 country that was the right way one gains nothing by travelling 
 everything can be acquired here quite as easily so i stayed at 
 home i have not obtained what i know from supernatural beings i have neither swallowed it nor learnt it from conversing with owls i 
 have got it all from my reflections and thoughts will you now set the 
 kettle on the fire so now pour the water in quite full up to the 
 brim place it on the fire make up a good blaze keep it burning 
 that the water may boil it must boil over and over there now i 
 throw in the skewer will the be pleased now to dip his 
 tail into the boiling water and stir it round with the tail the 
 longer the king stirs it the stronger the soup will become nothing 
 more is necessary only to stir it 
 
 can no one else do this asked the king 
 
 no said the mouse only in the tail of the is 
 this power contained 
 
 and the water boiled and bubbled as the stood close 
 beside the kettle it seemed rather a dangerous performance but he 
 turned round and put out his tail as mice do in a dairy when they 
 wish to skim the cream from a pan of milk with their tails and 
 afterwards lick it off but the mous

 the compel people to take them seriously 
 thet flocked round gavroche 
 but he had no time to tell anything marius drew him aside with a shudder 
 what are you doing here 
 hullo said the child what are you doing here yourself 
 and he stared at marius intently with his epic effrontery his eyes grew larger with the proud light within them 
 it was with an accent of severity that marius continued 
 who told you to come back 
 did you deliver my letter at the address 
 gavroche was not without some compunctions in the matter of that letter 
 in his haste to return to the barricade he had got rid of it rather than delivered it 
 he was forced to acknowledge to himself that he had confided it rather lightly to that stranger whose face he had not been able to make out 
 it is true that the man was bareheaded but that was not sufficient 
 in short he had been administering to himself little inward remonstrances and he feared marius reproaches 
 in order to extricate himself from the predicament he took the simplest course he lied abominably 
 citizen i delivered the letter to the porter 
 the lady was asleep she will have the letter when she wakes up 
 marius had had two objects in sending that letter 
 to bid farewell to cosette and to save gavroche 
 he was obliged to content himself with the half of his desire 
 the despatch of his letter and the presence of m fauchelevent in the barricade was a coincidence which occurred to him he pointed out m fauchelevent to gavroche 
 do you know that man 
 no said gavroche 
 gavroche had in fact as we have just mentioned seen jean valjean only at night 
 the troubled and unhealthy conjectures which had outlined themselves in marius mind were dissipated 
 did he know m opinions perhaps m fauchelevent was a republican 
 hence his very natural presence in this combat 
 in the meanwhile gavroche was shouting at the other end of the barricade 
 my gun 
 courfeyrac had it returned to him 
 gavroche warned his comrades as he called them that the barricade was blocked 
 he had had great difficulty in reaching it a battalion of the line whose arms were piled in the rue de la petite truanderie was on the watch on the side of the rue du cygne on the opposite side the municipal guard occupied the rue des precheurs the bulk of the army was facing them in front 
 this information given gavroche added 
 i authorize you to hit em a tremendous whack 
 meanwhile enjolras was straining his ears and watching at his embrasure 
 the assailants dissatisfied no doubt with their shot had not repeated it 
 a company of infantry of the line had come up and occupied the end of the street behind the piece of ordnance 
 the soldiers were tearing up the pavement and constructing with the stones a small low wall a sort of not more than eighteen inches high and facing the barricade 
 in the angle at the left of this epaulement there was visible the head of the column of a battalion from the suburbs massed in the rue 
 enjolras on the watch thought he distinguished the peculiar sound which is produced when the shells of are drawn from the caissons and he saw the commander of the piece change the elevation and incline the mouth of the cannon slightly to the left then the cannoneers began to load the piece 
 the chief seized the himself and lowered it to the vent 
 down with your heads hug the wall shouted enjolras and all on your knees along the barricade 
 the insurgents who were straggling in front of the and who had quitted their posts of combat on arrival rushed towards the barricade but before enjolras order could be executed the discharge took place with the terrifying rattle of a round of this is what it was in fact 
 the charge had been aimed at the cut in the redoubt and had there rebounded from the wall and this terrible rebound had produced two dead and three wounded 
 if this were continued the barricade was no longer tenable the made its way in 
 a murmur of consternation arose 
 let us prevent the second discharge said enjolras 
 and lowering his rifle he took aim at the captain of the gun who at that moment was bearing down on the breach of his gun and rectifying and definitely fixing its pointing 
 the captain of the piece was a handsome sergeant of artillery very young blond with a very gentle face and the intelligent air peculiar to that predestined and redoubtable weapon which by dint of perfecting itself in horror must end in killing war 
 combeferre who was standing beside enjolras scrutinized this young man 
 what a pity said combeferre 
 what hideous things these butcheries are 
 come when there are no more kings there will be no more war 
 enjolras you are taking aim at that sergeant you are not looking at him 
 fancy he is a charming young man he is intrepid it is evident that he is thoughtful those young are very well educated he has a father a mother a family he is probably in love he is not more than five and twenty at the most he might be your brother 
 he is said enjolras 
 yes replied combeferre he is mine too 
 well let us not kill him 
 let me alone 
 it must be done 
 and a tear trickled slowly down enjolras marble cheek 
 at the same moment he pressed the trigger of his rifle 
 the flame leaped forth 
 the turned round twice his arms extended in front of him his head uplifted as though for breath then he fell with his side on the gun and lay there motionless they could see his back from the centre of which there flowed directly a stream of blood 
 the ball had traversed his breast from side to side 
 he was dead 
 he had to be carried away and replaced by another 
 several minutes were thus gained in fact

 book fourteen 
 chapter xii 
 
 during the whole of their march from moscow no fresh orders had been issued by the french authorities concerning the party of prisoners among whom was pierre on the of october that party was no longer with the same troops and baggage trains with which it had left moscow half the wagons laden with hardtack that had traveled the first stages with them had been captured by cossacks the other half had gone on ahead not one of those dismounted cavalrymen who had marched in front of the prisoners was left they had all disappeared the artillery the prisoners had seen in front of them during the first days was now replaced by marshal enormous baggage train convoyed by westphalians behind the prisoners came a cavalry baggage train 
 from vyazma onwards the french army which had till then moved in three columns went on as a single group the symptoms of disorder that pierre had noticed at their first halting place after leaving moscow had now reached the utmost limit 
 the road along which they moved was bordered on both sides by dead horses ragged men who had fallen behind from various regiments continually changed about now joining the moving column now again lagging behind it 
 several times during the march false alarms had been given and the soldiers of the escort had raised their muskets fired and run headlong crushing one another but had afterwards reassembled and abused each other for their causeless panic 
 these three groups traveling together the cavalry stores the convoy of prisoners and baggage train still constituted a separate and united whole though each of the groups was rapidly melting away 
 of the artillery baggage train which had consisted of a hundred and twenty wagons not more than sixty now remained the rest had been captured or left behind some of wagons also had been captured or abandoned three wagons had been raided and robbed by stragglers from corps from the talk of the germans pierre learned that a larger guard had been allotted to that baggage train than to the prisoners and that one of their comrades a german soldier had been shot by the own order because a silver spoon belonging to the marshal had been found in his possession 
 the group of prisoners had melted away most of all of the three hundred and thirty men who had set out from moscow fewer than a hundred now remained the prisoners were more burdensome to the escort than even the cavalry saddles or baggage they understood that the saddles and spoon might be of some use but that cold and hungry soldiers should have to stand and guard equally cold and hungry russians who froze and lagged behind on the road in which case the order was to shoot them was not merely incomprehensible but revolting and the escort as if afraid in the grievous condition they themselves were in of giving way to the pity they felt for the prisoners and so rendering their own plight still worse treated them with particular moroseness and severity 
 at dorogobuzh while the soldiers of the convoy after locking the prisoners in a stable had gone off to pillage their own stores several of the soldier prisoners tunneled under the wall and ran away but were recaptured by the french and shot 
 the arrangement adopted when they started that the officer prisoners should be kept separate from the rest had long since been abandoned all who could walk went together and after the third stage pierre had rejoined karataev and the dog that had chosen karataev for its master 
 on the third day after leaving moscow karataev again fell ill with the fever he had suffered from in the hospital in moscow and as he grew gradually weaker pierre kept away from him pierre did not know why but since karataev had begun to grow weaker it had cost him an effort to go near him when he did so and heard the subdued moaning with which karataev generally lay down at the halting places and when he smelled the odor emanating from him which was now stronger than before pierre moved farther away and did not think about him 
 while imprisoned in the shed pierre had learned not with his intellect but with his whole being by life itself that man is created for happiness that happiness is within him in the satisfaction of simple human needs and that all unhappiness arises not from privation but from superfluity and now during these last three weeks of the march he had learned still another new consolatory truth that nothing in this world is terrible he had learned that as there is no condition in which man can be happy and entirely free so there is no condition in which he need be unhappy and lack freedom he learned that suffering and freedom have their limits and that those limits are very near together that the person in a bed of roses with one crumpled petal suffered as keenly as he now sleeping on the bare damp earth with one side growing chilled while the other was warming and that when he had put on tight dancing shoes he had suffered just as he did now when he walked with bare feet that were covered with sores his footgear having long since fallen to pieces he discovered that when he had married his wife of his own free will as it had seemed to him he had been no more free than now when they locked him up at night in a stable of all that he himself subsequently termed his sufferings but which at the time he scarcely felt the worst was the state of his bare raw and feet the horseflesh was appetizing and nourishing the saltpeter flavor of the gunpowder they used instead of salt was even pleasant there was no great cold it was always warm walking in the daytime and at night there were the campfires the lice that devoured him warmed his body the one thing that was at first hard to bear was his feet 
 after the second march pierre having examined his feet by the campfire thought it would be impossible to walk on them but when everybody got up he went along limping and when he had warmed up walked without feeling the pain though at night his feet were more terrible to look at than before however he did not look at them now but thought of other things 
 only now did pierre realize the full strength of life in man and the saving power he has of transferring his attention from one thing to another which is like the safety valve of a boiler that allows superfluous steam to blow off when the pressure exceeds a certain limit 
 he did not see and did not hear how they shot the prisoners who lagged behind though more than a hundred perished in that way he did not think of karataev who grew weaker every day and evidently would soon have to share that fate still less did pierre think about himself the harder his position became and the more terrible the future the more independent of that position in which he found himself were the joyful and comforting thoughts memories and imaginings that came to him

 chapter x 
 
 dawn 
 at that moment cosette awoke 
 her chamber was narrow neat unobtrusive with a long facing the east on the back of the house 
 cosette knew nothing of what was going on in paris 
 she had not been there on the preceding evening and she had already retired to her chamber when toussaint had said 
 it appears that there is a row 
 cosette had slept only a few hours but soundly 
 she had had sweet dreams which possibly arose from the fact that her little bed was very white 
 some one who was marius had appeared to her in the light 
 she awoke with the sun in her eyes which at first produced on her the effect of being a continuation of her dream her first thought on emerging from this dream was a smiling one cosette felt herself thoroughly reassured 
 like jean valjean she had a few hours previously passed through that reaction of the soul which absolutely will not hear of unhappiness she began to cherish hope with all her might without knowing why then she felt a pang at her heart 
 it was three days since she had seen marius 
 but she said to herself that he must have received her letter that he knew where she was and that he was so clever that he would find means of reaching that certainly and perhaps that very was broad daylight but the rays of light were very horizontal she thought that it was very early but that she must rise nevertheless in order to receive marius 
 she felt that she could not live without marius and that consequently that was sufficient and that marius would come no objection was valid 
 all this was certain 
 it was monstrous enough already to have suffered for three days 
 marius absent three days this was horrible on the part of the good god 
 now this cruel teasing from on high had been gone through with 
 marius was about to arrive and he would bring good news 
 youth is made thus it quickly dries its eyes it finds sorrow useless and does not accept it 
 youth is the smile of the future in the presence of an unknown quantity which is itself 
 it is natural to it to be happy it seems as though its respiration were made of hope 
 moreover cosette could not remember what marius had said to her on the subject of this absence which was to last only one day and what explanation of it he had given her 
 every one has noticed with what nimbleness a coin which one has dropped on the ground rolls away and hides and with what art it renders itself undiscoverable there are thoughts which play us the same trick they nestle away in a corner of our brain that is the end of them they are lost it is impossible to lay the memory on them 
 cosette was somewhat vexed at the useless little effort made by her memory 
 she told herself that it was very naughty and very wicked of her to have forgotten the words uttered by marius 
 she sprang out of bed and accomplished the two ablutions of soul and body her prayers and her toilet 
 one may in a case of exigency introduce the reader into a nuptial chamber not into a virginal chamber 
 verse would hardly venture it prose must not 
 it is the interior of a flower that is not yet unfolded it is whiteness in the dark it is the private cell of a closed lily which must not be gazed upon by man so long as the sun has not gazed upon it 
 woman in the bud is sacred 
 that innocent bud which opens that adorable which is afraid of itself that white foot which takes refuge in a slipper that throat which veils itself before a mirror as though a mirror were an eye that chemise which makes haste to rise up and conceal the shoulder for a creaking bit of furniture or a passing vehicle those cords tied those clasps fastened those laces drawn those tremors those shivers of cold and modesty that exquisite affright in every movement that almost winged uneasiness where there is no cause for alarm the successive phases of dressing as charming as the clouds of dawn it is not fitting that all this should be narrated and it is too much to have even called attention to it 
 the eye of man must be more religious in the presence of the rising of a young girl than in the presence of the rising of a star the possibility of hurting should inspire an augmentation of respect the down on the peach the bloom on the plum the radiated crystal of 
 the snow the wing of the butterfly powdered with feathers are coarse compared to that chastity which does not even know that it is chaste the young girl is only the flash of a dream and is not yet a statue her is hidden in the sombre part of the ideal the indiscreet touch of a glance brutalizes this vague penumbra here contemplation is profanation 
 we shall therefore show nothing of that sweet little flutter of rising 
 an oriental tale relates how the rose was made white by god but that adam looked upon her when she was unfolding and she was ashamed and turned crimson 
 we are of the number who fall speechless in the presence of young girls and flowers since we think them worthy of veneration 
 cosette dressed herself very hastily combed and dressed her hair which was a very simple matter in those days when women did not swell out their curls and bands with cushions and puffs and did not put crinoline in their locks 
 then she opened the window and cast her eyes around her in every direction hoping to descry some bit of the street an angle of the house an edge of pavement so that she might be able to watch for marius there 
 but no view of the outside was to be had 
 the back court was surrounded by tolerably high walls and the outlook was only on several gardens cosette pronounced these gardens hideous 
 for the first time in her life she found flowers ugly 
 the smallest scrap of the gutter of the street would have met her wishes better 
 she decided to gaze at the sky as though she thought that marius might come from that quarter 
 all at once she burst into tears 
 not that this was fickleness of soul but hopes cut in twain by was her case she had a confused consciousness of something horrible 
 thoughts were rife in the air in fact 
 she told herself that she was not sure of anything that to withdraw herself from sight was to be lost and the idea that marius could return to her from heaven appeared to her no longer charming but mournful 
 then as is the nature of these clouds calm returned to her and hope and a sort of unconscious smile which yet indicated trust in god 
 every one in the house was still asleep 
 a silence reigned not a shutter had been opened 
 the lodge was closed toussaint had not risen and cosette naturally thought that her father was asleep 
 she must have suffered much and she must have still been suffering greatly for she said to herself that her father had been unkind but she counted on marius 
 the eclipse of such a light was decidedly impossible 
 now and then she heard sharp shocks in the distance and she said 
 it is odd that people should be opening and shutting their carriage gates so early they were the reports of the cannon battering the barricade 
 a few feet below window in the ancient and perfectly black cornice of the wall there was a nest the curve of this nest formed a little projection beyond the cornice so that from above it was possible to look into this little paradise the mother was there spreading her wings like a fan over her brood the father fluttered about flew away then came back bearing in his beak food and kisses 
 the dawning day gilded this happy thing the great law multiply lay there smiling and august and that sweet mystery unfolded in the glory of the morning 
 cosette with her hair in the sunlight her soul absorbed in chimeras illuminated by love within and by the dawn without bent over mechanically and almost without daring to avow to herself that she was thinking at the same time of marius began to gaze at these birds at this family at that male and female that mother and her little ones with the profound trouble which a nest produces on a virgin

 employment of the old talents of a poacher and that infalliblemarksmanship which influenced the condemnation of 
 opinions were exchanged in the barricade the firing from the gunwas about to begin again against that they could nothold out a quarter of an hour longer it was absolutely necessaryto deaden the blows 
 enjolras issued this command 
 we must place a mattress there 
 we have none said combeferre the wounded are lying on them 
 jean valjean who was seated apart on a stone post at the cornerof the tavern with his gun between his knees had up to that no part in anything that was going on he did not appearto hear the combatants saying around him here is a gun that isdoing nothing 
 at the order issued by enjolras he rose 
 it will be remembered that on the arrival of the rabble in the ruede la chanvrerie an old woman foreseeing the bullets had placedher mattress in front of her window this window an attic on the roof of a house situated a little beyondthe barricade the mattress placed supported atthe bottom on two poles for drying linen was upheld at the topby two ropes which at that distance looked like two which were attached to two nails planted in the window frames these ropes were distinctly visible like hairs against the sky 
 can some one lend me a rifle said jean valjean 
 enjolras who had just his handed it to him 
 jean valjean took aim at the attic window and fired 
 one of the mattress ropes was cut 
 the mattress now hung by one thread only 
 jean valjean fired the second charge the second rope lashedthe panes of the attic window the mattress slipped betweenthe two poles and fell into the street 
 the barricade applauded 
 all voices cried 
 here is a mattress 
 yes said combeferre but who will go and fetch it 
 the mattress had in fact fallen outside the besiegers and besieged now the death of the sergeantof artillery having exasperated the troop the soldiers several minutes been lying flat on their stomachs behindthe line of which they had erected and in orderto supply the forced silence of the piece which was quiet whileits service was in course of reorganization they had opened fireon the barricade the insurgents did not reply to this order to spare their ammunition the fusillade broke againstthe barricade but the street which it filled was terrible 
 jean valjean stepped out of the cut entered the the storm of bullets walked up to the it upon his back and returned to the barricade 
 he placed the mattress in the cut with his own hands he fixedit there against the wall in such a manner that the not see it 
 that done they awaited the next discharge of 
 it was not long in coming 
 the cannon vomited forth its package of with a roar but there was no rebound the effect which they had foreseen hadbeen attained the barricade was saved 
 citizen said enjolras to jean valjean the republic thanks you 
 bossuet admired and laughed he exclaimed 
 it is immoral that a mattress should have so much power triumph of that which yields over that which strikes with lightning but never mind glory to the mattress which annuls a cannon

 at that moment cosette awoke 
 her chamber was narrow neat unobtrusive with a long the east on the back of the house 
 cosette knew nothing of what was going on in paris she had notbeen there on the preceding evening and she had already retiredto her chamber when toussaint had said 
 it appears that there is a row 
 cosette had slept only a few hours but soundly she had hadsweet dreams which possibly arose from the fact that her littlebed was very white some one who was marius had appeared to herin the light she awoke with the sun in her eyes which at on her the effect of being a continuation of her dream her first thought on emerging from this dream was a smiling one cosette felt herself thoroughly reassured like jean had a few hours previously passed through that reactionof the soul which absolutely will not hear of unhappiness she began to cherish hope with all her might without knowing why then she felt a pang at her heart it was three days since shehad seen marius but she said to herself that he must have receivedher letter that he knew where she was and that he was so cleverthat he would find means of reaching that and perhaps that very was broad the rays of light were very horizontal she thought that itwas very early but that she must rise nevertheless in order toreceive marius

 chapter xiii 
 
 at midday on the of october pierre was going uphill along the muddy slippery road looking at his feet and at the roughness of the way occasionally he glanced at the familiar crowd around him and then again at his feet the former and the latter were alike familiar and his own the bandy legged dog ran merrily along the side of the road sometimes in proof of its agility and lifting one hind leg and hopping along on three and then again going on all four and rushing to bark at the crows that sat on the carrion the dog was merrier and sleeker than it had been in moscow all around lay the flesh of different animals from men to horses in various stages of decomposition and as the wolves were kept off by the passing men the dog could eat all it wanted 
 it had been raining since morning and had seemed as if at any moment it might cease and the sky clear but after a short break it began raining harder than before the saturated road no longer absorbed the water which ran along the ruts in streams 
 pierre walked along looking from side to side counting his steps in threes and reckoning them off on his fingers mentally addressing the rain he repeated now then now then go on pelt harder 
 it seemed to him that he was thinking of nothing but far down and deep within him his soul was occupied with something important and comforting this something was a most subtle spiritual deduction from a conversation with karataev the day before 
 at their halting place feeling chilly by a dying campfire pierre had got up and gone to the next one which was burning better there platon karataev was sitting covered up head and all with his greatcoat as if it were a vestment telling the soldiers in his effective and pleasant though now feeble voice a story pierre knew it was already past midnight the hour when karataev was usually free of his fever and particularly lively when pierre reached the fire and heard voice enfeebled by illness and saw his pathetic face brightly lit up by the blaze he felt a painful prick at his heart his feeling of pity for this man frightened him and he wished to go away but there was no other fire and pierre sat down trying not to look at platon 
 well how are you he asked 
 how am i if we grumble at sickness god grant us death replied platon and at once resumed the story he had begun 
 and so brother he continued with a smile on his pale emaciated face and a particularly happy light in his eyes you see brother 
 pierre had long been familiar with that story karataev had told it to him alone some times and always with a specially joyful emotion but well as he knew it pierre now listened to that tale as to something new and the quiet rapture karataev evidently felt as he told it communicated itself also to pierre the story was of an old merchant who lived a good and life with his family and who went once to the nizhni fair with a companion a rich merchant 
 having put up at an inn they both went to sleep and next morning his companion was found robbed and with his throat cut a bloodstained knife was found under the old pillow he was tried knouted and his nostrils having been torn off all in due form as karataev put it he was sent to hard labor in siberia 
 and so brother it was at this point that pierre came up ten years or more passed by the old man was living as a convict submitting as he should and doing no wrong only he prayed to god for death well one night the convicts were gathered just as we are with the old man among them and they began telling what each was suffering for and how they had sinned against god one told how he had taken a life another had taken two a third had set a house on fire while another had simply been a vagrant and had done nothing so they asked the old man what are you being punished for daddy i my dear brothers said he am being punished for my own and other sins but i have not killed anyone or taken anything that was not mine but have only helped my poorer brothers i was a merchant my dear brothers and had much property and he went on to tell them all about it in due order i grieve for myself he says god it seems has chastened me only i am sorry for my old wife and the children and the old man began to weep now it happened that in the group was the very man who had killed the other merchant where did it happen daddy he said when and in what month he asked all about it and his heart began to ache so he comes up to the old man like this and falls down at his feet you are perishing because of me daddy he says quite true lads that this man he says is being tortured innocently and for nothing i he says did that deed and i put the knife under your head while you were asleep forgive me daddy he says for sake 
 karataev paused smiling joyously as he gazed into the fire and he drew the logs together 
 and the old man said god will forgive you we are all sinners in his sight i suffer for my own sins and he wept bitter tears well and what do you think dear friends karataev continued his face brightening more and more with a rapturous smile as if what he now had to tell contained the chief charm and the whole meaning of his story what do you think dear fellows that murderer confessed to the authorities i have taken six lives he says he was a great sinner but what i am most sorry for is this old man let him suffer because of me so he confessed and it was all written down and the papers sent off in due form the place was a long way off and while they were judging what with one thing and another filling in the papers all in due form the authorities i mean time passed the affair reached the tsar after a while the decree came to set the merchant free and give him a compensation that had been awarded the paper arrived and they began to look for the old man where is the old man who has been suffering innocently and in vain a paper has come from the tsar so they began looking for him here lower jaw trembled but god had already forgiven him he was dead how it was dear fellows karataev concluded and sat for a long time silent gazing before him with a smile 
 and soul was dimly but joyfully filled not by the story itself but by its mysterious significance by the rapturous joy that lit up face as he told it and the mystic significance of that joy

 the shot which misses nothing and kills no one 
 the assailants fire continued 
 musketry and alternated but without committing great ravages to tell the truth 
 the top alone of the corinthe facade suffered the window on the first floor and the attic window in the roof riddled with and biscaiens were slowly losing their shape 
 the combatants who had been posted there had been obliged to withdraw 
 however this is according to the tactics of barricades to fire for a long while in order to exhaust the insurgents ammunition if they commit the mistake of replying 
 when it is perceived from the slackening of their fire that they have no more powder and ball the assault is made enjolras had not fallen into this trap the barricade did not reply 
 at every discharge by platoons gavroche puffed out his cheek with his tongue a sign of supreme disdain 
 good for you said he rip up the cloth 
 we want some lint 
 courfeyrac called the to order for the little effect which it produced and said to the cannon 
 you are growing diffuse my good fellow 
 one gets puzzled in battle as at a ball 
 it is probable that this silence on the part of the redoubt began to render the besiegers uneasy and to make them fear some unexpected incident and that they felt the necessity of getting a clear view behind that heap of and of knowing what was going on behind that impassable wall which received blows without retorting 
 the insurgents suddenly perceived a helmet glittering in the sun on a neighboring roof a fireman had placed his back against a tall chimney and seemed to be acting as sentinel 
 his glance fell directly down into the barricade 
 an embarrassing watcher said enjolras 
 jean valjean had returned enjolras rifle but he had his own gun 
 without saying a word he took aim at the fireman and a second later the helmet smashed by a bullet rattled noisily into the street the terrified soldier made haste to disappear 
 a second observer took his place 
 this one was an officer 
 jean valjean who had his gun took aim at the newcomer and sent the casque to join the the officer did not persist and retired speedily 
 this time the warning was understood no one made his appearance thereafter on that roof and the idea of spying on the barricade was abandoned 
 why did you not kill the man 
 bossuet asked jean valjean 
 jean valjean made no reply

 a vos places suddenly cried a voice 
 to your places 
 a pleasant feeling of excitement and an expectation of something joyful and solemn was aroused among the soldiers of the convoy and the prisoners from all sides came shouts of command and from the left came smartly dressed cavalrymen on good horses passing the prisoners at a trot the expression on all faces showed the tension people feel at the approach of those in authority the prisoners thronged together and were pushed off the road the convoy formed up 
 the emperor the emperor the marshal the duke and hardly had the sleek cavalry passed before a carriage drawn by six gray horses rattled by pierre caught a glimpse of a man in a hat with a tranquil look on his handsome plump white face it was one of the marshals his eye fell on large and striking figure and in the expression with which he frowned and looked away pierre thought he detected sympathy and a desire to conceal that sympathy 
 the general in charge of the stores galloped after the carriage with a red and frightened face whipping up his skinny horse several officers formed a group and some soldiers crowded round them their faces all looked excited and worried 
 what did he say what did he say pierre heard them ask 
 while the marshal was passing the prisoners had huddled together in a crowd and pierre saw karataev whom he had not yet seen that morning he sat in his short overcoat leaning against a birch tree on his face besides the look of joyful emotion it had worn yesterday while telling the tale of the merchant who suffered innocently there was now an expression of quiet solemnity 
 karataev looked at pierre with his kindly round eyes now filled with tears evidently wishing him to come near that he might say something to him but pierre was not sufficiently sure of himself he made as if he did not notice that look and moved hastily away 
 when the prisoners again went forward pierre looked round karataev was still sitting at the side of the road under the birch tree and two frenchmen were talking over his head pierre did not look round again but went limping up the hill 
 from behind where karataev had been sitting came the sound of a shot pierre heard it plainly but at that moment he remembered that he had not yet finished reckoning up how many stages still remained to smolensk a calculation he had begun before the marshal went by and he again started reckoning two french soldiers ran past pierre one of whom carried a lowered and smoking gun they both looked pale and in the expression on their faces one of them glanced timidly at pierre there was something resembling what he had seen on the face of the young soldier at the execution pierre looked at the soldier and remembered that two days before that man had burned his shirt while drying it at the fire and how they had laughed at him 
 behind him where karataev had been sitting the dog began to howl what a stupid beast why is it howling thought pierre 
 his comrades the prisoner soldiers walking beside him avoided looking back at the place where the shot had been fired and the dog was howling just as pierre did but there was a set look on all their faces

 disorder a partisan of order 
 bossuet muttered in ear 
 he did not answer my question 
 he is a man who does good by said combeferre 
 those who have preserved some memory of this already distant epoch know that the national guard from the suburbs was valiant against insurrections 
 it was particularly zealous and intrepid in the days of june 
 a certain good keeper of pantin des vertus or la cunette whose establishment had been closed by the riots became leonine at the sight of his deserted and got himself killed to preserve the order represented by a in that bourgeois and heroic time in the presence of ideas which had their knights interests had their paladins the prosiness of the originators detracted nothing from the bravery of the movement 
 the diminution of a pile of crowns made bankers sing the marseillaise 
 they shed their blood lyrically for the and they defended the shop that immense diminutive of the fatherland with lacedaemonian enthusiasm 
 at bottom we will observe there was nothing in all this that was not extremely serious 
 it was social elements entering into strife while awaiting the day when they should enter into equilibrium 
 another sign of the times was the anarchy mingled with governmentalism the barbarous name of the correct party people were for order in combination with lack of discipline 
 the drum suddenly beat capricious calls at the command of such or such a colonel of the national guard such and such a captain went into action through inspiration such and such national guardsmen fought for an idea and on their own account 
 at critical moments on days they took counsel less of their leaders than of their instincts there existed in the army of order veritable guerilleros some of the sword like fannicot others of the pen like henri fonfrede 
 civilization unfortunately represented at this epoch rather by an aggregation of interests than by a group of principles was or thought itself in peril it set up the cry of alarm each constituting himself a centre defended it succored it and protected it with his own head and the first comer took it upon himself to save society 
 zeal sometimes proceeded to extermination 
 a platoon of the national guard would constitute itself on its own authority a private council of war and judge and execute a captured insurgent in five minutes it was an improvisation of this sort that had slain jean prouvaire fierce lynch law with which no one party had any right to reproach the rest for it has been applied by the republic in america as well as by the monarchy in europe 
 this lynch law was complicated with mistakes 
 on one day of rioting a young poet named paul aime garnier was pursued in the place royale with a bayonet at his loins and only escaped by taking refuge under the of no 
 they another of those and they wanted to kill him 
 now he had under his arm a volume of the memoirs of the duc de a national guard had read the words on the book and had shouted 
 death 
 on the th of june a company of the national guards from the suburbs commanded by the captain fannicot above mentioned had itself decimated in the rue de la chanvrerie out of caprice and its own good pleasure 
 this fact singular though it may seem was proved at the judicial investigation opened in consequence of the insurrection of 
 captain fannicot a bold and impatient bourgeois a sort of condottiere of the order of those whom we have just characterized a fanatical and intractable governmentalist could not resist the temptation to fire prematurely and the ambition of capturing the barricade alone and unaided that is to say with his company 
 exasperated by the successive apparition of the red flag and the old coat which he took for the black flag he loudly blamed the generals and chiefs of the corps who were holding council and did not think that the moment for the decisive assault had arrived and who were allowing the insurrection to fry in its own fat to use the celebrated expression of one of them for his part he thought the barricade ripe and as that which is ripe ought to fall he made the attempt 
 he commanded men as resolute as himself raging fellows as a witness said 
 his company the same which had shot jean prouvaire the poet was the first of the battalion posted at the angle of the street at the moment when they were least expecting it the captain launched his men against the barricade 
 this movement executed with more good will than strategy cost the fannicot company dear before it had traversed two thirds of the street it was received by a general discharge from the barricade 
 four the most audacious who were running on in front were mown down at the very foot of the redoubt and this courageous throng of national guards very brave men but lacking in military tenacity were forced to fall back after some hesitation leaving fifteen corpses on the pavement this momentary hesitation gave the insurgents time to their weapons and a second and very destructive discharge struck the company before it could regain the corner of the street its shelter 
 a moment more and it was caught between two fires and it received the volley from the battery piece which not having received the order had not discontinued its firing 
 the intrepid and imprudent fannicot was one of the dead from this he was killed by the cannon that is to say by order 
 this attack which was more furious than serious irritated fools said he 
 they are getting their own men killed and they are using up our ammunition for nothing 
 enjolras spoke like the real general of insurrection which he was insurrection and repression do not fight with equal weapons insurrection which is speedily exhausted has only a certain number of shots to fire and a certain number of combatants to expend an empty a man killed cannot be replaced 
 as repression has the army it does not count its men and as it has vincennes it does not count its shots 
 repression has as many regiments as the barricade has men and as many arsenals as the barricade has thus they are struggles of one against a hundred which always end in crushing the barricade unless the revolution uprising suddenly flings into the balance its flaming sword this does happen sometimes 
 then everything rises the pavements begin to seethe popular redoubts abound 
 paris quivers supremely the quid divinum is given forth a th of august is in the air a th of july is in the air a wonderful light appears the yawning maw of force draws back and the army that lion sees before it erect and tranquil that prophet france

 the stores the prisoners and the baggage train stopped at the village of shamshevo the men crowded together round the campfires pierre went up to the fire ate some roast horseflesh lay down with his back to the fire and immediately fell asleep he again slept as he had done at mozhaysk after the battle of borodino 
 again real events mingled with dreams and again someone he or another gave expression to his thoughts and even to the same thoughts that had been expressed in his dream at mozhaysk 
 life is everything life is god everything changes and moves and that movement is god and while there is life there is joy in consciousness of the divine to love life is to love god harder and more blessed than all else is to love this life in sufferings in innocent sufferings 
 karataev came to mind 
 and suddenly he saw vividly before him a kindly old man who had given him geography lessons in switzerland wait a bit said the old man and showed pierre a globe this globe was alive a vibrating ball without fixed dimensions its whole surface consisted of drops closely pressed together and all these drops moved and changed places sometimes several of them merging into one sometimes one dividing into many each drop tried to spread out and occupy as much space as possible but others striving to do the same compressed it sometimes destroyed it and sometimes merged with it 
 that is life said the old teacher 
 how simple and clear it is thought pierre how is it i did not know it before 
 god is in the midst and each drop tries to expand so as to reflect him to the greatest extent and it grows merges disappears from the surface sinks to the depths and again emerges there now karataev has spread out and disappeared do you understand my child said the teacher 
 do you understand damn you shouted a voice and pierre woke up 
 he lifted himself and sat up a frenchman who had just pushed a russian soldier away was squatting by the fire engaged in roasting a piece of meat stuck on a ramrod his sleeves were rolled up and his sinewy hairy red hands with their short fingers deftly turned the ramrod his brown morose face with frowning brows was clearly visible by the glow of the charcoal 
 all the same to him he muttered turning quickly to a soldier who stood behind him brigand get away 
 and twisting the ramrod he looked gloomily at pierre who turned away and gazed into the darkness a prisoner the russian soldier the frenchman had pushed away was sitting near the fire patting something with his hand looking more closely pierre recognized the dog sitting beside the soldier wagging its tail 
 ah come said pierre and plat he began but did not finish 
 suddenly and simultaneously a crowd of memories awoke in his fancy of the look platon had given him as he sat under the tree of the shot heard from that spot of the howl of the guilty faces of the two frenchmen as they ran past him of the lowered and smoking gun and of absence at this halt and he was on the point of realizing that karataev had been killed but just at that instant he knew not why the recollection came to his mind of a summer evening he had spent with a beautiful polish lady on the veranda of his house in kiev and without linking up the events of the day or drawing a conclusion from them pierre closed his eyes seeing a vision of the country in summertime mingled with memories of bathing and of the liquid vibrating globe and he sank into water so that it closed over his head 
 before sunrise he was awakened by shouts and loud and rapid firing french soldiers were running past him 
 the cossacks one of them shouted and a moment later a crowd of russians surrounded pierre 
 for a long time he could not understand what was happening to him all around he heard his comrades sobbing with joy 
 brothers dear fellows darlings old soldiers exclaimed weeping as they embraced cossacks and hussars 
 the hussars and cossacks crowded round the prisoners one offered them clothes another boots and a third bread pierre sobbed as he sat among them and could not utter a word he hugged the first soldier who approached him and kissed him weeping 
 dolokhov stood at the gate of the ruined house letting a crowd of disarmed frenchmen pass by the french excited by all that had happened were talking loudly among themselves but as they passed dolokhov who gently switched his boots with his whip and watched them with cold glassy eyes that boded no good they became silent on the opposite side stood cossack counting the prisoners and marking off each hundred with a chalk line on the gate 
 how many dolokhov asked the cossack 
 the second hundred replied the cossack 
 filez filez dolokhov kept saying having adopted this expression from the french and when his eyes met those of the prisoners they flashed with a cruel light 
 get along get along 
 denisov bareheaded and with a gloomy face walked behind some cossacks who were carrying the body of petya rostov to a hole that had been dug in the garden

 in the chaos of sentiments and passions which defend a barricade there is a little of everything there is bravery there is youth honor enthusiasm the ideal conviction the rage of the gambler and above all intermittences of hope 
 one of these intermittences one of these vague quivers of hope suddenly traversed the barricade of the rue de la chanvrerie at the moment when it was least expected 
 listen suddenly cried enjolras who was still on the watch it seems to me that paris is waking up 
 it is certain that on the morning of the th of june the insurrection broke out afresh for an hour or two to a certain extent the obstinacy of the alarm peal of reanimated some fancies 
 barricades were begun in the rue du poirier and the rue des gravilliers 
 in front of the porte a young man armed with a rifle attacked alone a squadron of cavalry in plain sight on the open boulevard he placed one knee on the ground shouldered his weapon fired killed the commander of the squadron and turned away saying 
 another who will do us no more harm 
 he was put to the sword 
 in the rue a woman fired on the national guard from behind a lowered blind 
 the slats of the blind could be seen to tremble at every shot 
 a child fourteen years of age was arrested in the rue de la cossonerie with his pockets full of cartridges 
 many posts were attacked at the entrance to the rue a very lively and utterly unexpected fusillade welcomed a regiment of cuirrassiers at whose head marched marshal general cavaignac de barague in the rue they threw old pieces of pottery and household utensils down on the soldiers from the roofs a bad sign and when this matter was reported to marshal soult old lieutenant grew thoughtful as he recalled saying at saragossa we are lost when the old women empty their pots de chambre on our heads 
 these general symptoms which presented themselves at the moment when it was thought that the uprising had been rendered local this fever of wrath these sparks which flew hither and thither above those deep masses of combustibles which are called the faubourgs of this taken together disturbed the military chiefs they made haste to stamp out these beginnings of conflagration 
 they delayed the attack on the barricades maubuee de la chanvrerie and until these sparks had been extinguished in order that they might have to deal with the barricades only and be able to finish them at one blow 
 columns were thrown into the streets where there was fermentation sweeping the large sounding the small right and left now slowly and cautiously now at full charge the troops broke in the doors of houses whence shots had been fired at the same time manoeuvres by the cavalry dispersed the groups on the boulevards 
 this repression was not effected without some commotion and without that tumultuous uproar peculiar to collisions between the army and the people 
 this was what enjolras had caught in the intervals of the cannonade and the musketry moreover he had seen wounded men passing the end of the street in litters and he said to wounded do not come from us 
 their hope did not last long the gleam was quickly eclipsed in less than half an hour what was in the air vanished it was a flash of lightning unaccompanied by thunder and the insurgents felt that sort of leaden cope which the indifference of the people casts over obstinate and deserted men fall over them once more 
 the general movement which seemed to have assumed a vague outline had miscarried and the attention of the minister of war and the strategy of the generals could now be concentrated on the three or four barricades which still remained standing 
 the sun was mounting above the horizon 
 an insurgent hailed enjolras 
 we are hungry here 
 are we really going to die like this without anything to eat 
 enjolras who was still leaning on his elbows at his embrasure made an affirmative sign with his head but without taking his eyes from the end of the street

 after the of october when the frosts began the flight of the french assumed a still more tragic character with men freezing or roasting themselves to death at the campfires while carriages with people dressed in furs continued to drive past carrying away the property that had been stolen by the emperor kings and dukes but the process of the flight and disintegration of the french army went on essentially as before 
 from moscow to vyazma the french army of thousand men not reckoning the guards who did nothing during the whole war but pillage was reduced to thousand though not more than five thousand had fallen in battle from this beginning the succeeding terms of the progression could be determined mathematically the french army melted away and perished at the same rate from moscow to vyazma from vyazma to smolensk from smolensk to the berezina and from the berezina to vilna independently of the greater or lesser intensity of the cold the pursuit the barring of the way or any other particular conditions beyond vyazma the french army instead of moving in three columns huddled together into one mass and so went on to the end berthier wrote to his emperor we know how far commanding officers allow themselves to diverge from the truth in describing the condition of an army and this is what he said 
 i deem it my duty to report to your majesty the condition of the various corps i have had occasion to observe during different stages of the last two or three days march they are almost disbanded scarcely a quarter of the soldiers remain with the standards of their regiments the others go off by themselves in different directions hoping to find food and escape discipline in general they regard smolensk as the place where they hope to recover during the last few days many of the men have been seen to throw away their cartridges and their arms in such a state of affairs whatever your ultimate plans may be the interest of your service demands that the army should be rallied at smolensk and should first of all be freed from ineffectives such as dismounted cavalry unnecessary baggage and artillery material that is no longer in proportion to the present forces the soldiers who are worn out with hunger and fatigue need these supplies as well as a few days rest many have died last days on the road or at the bivouacs this state of things is continually becoming worse and makes one fear that unless a prompt remedy is applied the troops will no longer be under control in case of an engagement 
 november twenty miles from smolensk 
 after staggering into smolensk which seemed to them a promised land the french searching for food killed one another sacked their own stores and when everything had been plundered fled farther 
 they all went without knowing whither or why they were going still less did that genius napoleon know it for no one issued any orders to him but still he and those about him retained their old habits wrote commands letters reports and orders of the day called one another sire mon cousin prince roi de naples and so on but these orders and reports were only on paper nothing in them was acted upon for they could not be carried out and though they entitled one another majesties highnesses or cousins they all felt that they were miserable wretches who had done much evil for which they had now to pay and though they pretended to be concerned about the army each was thinking only of himself and of how to get away quickly and save himself

 wherein will appear the name of enjolras mistress 
 courfeyrac seated on a beside enjolras continued to insult the cannon and each time that that gloomy cloud of projectiles which is called passed overhead with its terrible sound he assailed it with a burst of irony 
 you are wearing out your lungs poor brutal old fellow you pain me you are wasting your row 
 not thunder a cough 
 and the bystanders laughed 
 courfeyrac and bossuet whose brave good humor increased with the peril like madame scarron replaced nourishment with pleasantry and as wine was lacking they poured out gayety to all 
 i admire enjolras said bossuet 
 his impassive temerity astounds me 
 he lives alone which renders him a little sad perhaps enjolras complains of his greatness which binds him to widowhood the rest of us have mistresses more or less who make us crazy that is to say brave 
 when a man is as much in love as a tiger the least that he can do is to fight like a lion 
 that is one way of taking our revenge for the capers that mesdames our grisettes play on us 
 roland gets himself killed for angelique all our heroism comes from our women 
 a man without a woman is a pistol without a trigger it is the woman that sets the man off 
 well enjolras has no woman 
 he is not in love and yet he manages to be intrepid it is a thing unheard of that a man should be as cold as ice and as bold as fire 
 enjolras did not appear to be listening but had any one been near him that person would have heard him mutter in a low voice 
 patria 
 bossuet was still laughing when courfeyrac exclaimed 
 news 
 and assuming the tone of an usher making an announcement he added 
 my name is 
 in fact a new personage had entered on the scene 
 this was a second piece of ordnance 
 the rapidly performed their manoeuvres in force and placed this second piece in line with the first 
 this outlined the catastrophe 
 a few minutes later the two pieces rapidly served were firing at the redoubt the platoon firing of the line and of the soldiers from the suburbs sustained the artillery 
 another cannonade was audible at some distance 
 at the same time that the two guns were furiously attacking the redoubt from the rue de la chanvrerie two other cannons trained one from the rue the other from the rue were riddling the barricade 
 the four cannons echoed each other mournfully 
 the barking of these sombre dogs of war replied to each other 
 one of the two pieces which was now battering the barricade on the rue de la chanvrerie was firing the other balls 
 the piece which was firing balls was pointed a little high and the aim was calculated so that the ball struck the extreme edge of the upper crest of the barricade and crumbled the stone down upon the insurgents mingled with bursts of 
 the object of this mode of firing was to drive the insurgents from the summit of the redoubt and to compel them to gather close in the interior that is to say this announced the assault 
 the combatants once driven from the crest of the barricade by balls and from the windows of the cabaret by the attacking columns could venture into the street without being picked off perhaps even without being seen could briskly and suddenly scale the redoubt as on the preceding evening and who knows take it by surprise 
 it is absolutely necessary that the inconvenience of those guns should be diminished said enjolras and he shouted 
 fire on the 
 all were ready 
 the barricade which had long been silent poured forth a desperate fire seven or eight discharges followed with a sort of rage and joy the street was filled with blinding smoke and at the end of a few minutes athwart this mist all streaked with flame two thirds of the gunners could be distinguished lying beneath the wheels of the cannons 
 those who were left standing continued to serve the pieces with severe tranquillity but the fire had slackened 
 things are going well now said bossuet to enjolras 
 success 
 enjolras shook his head and replied 
 another quarter of an hour of this success and there will not be any cartridges left in the barricade 
 it appears that gavroche overheard this remark

 the movements of the russian and french armies during the campaign from moscow back to the niemen were like those in a game of russian bluff in which two players are blindfolded and one of them occasionally rings a little bell to inform the catcher of his whereabouts first he rings his bell fearlessly but when he gets into a tight place he runs away as quietly as he can and often thinking to escape runs straight into his arms 
 at first while they were still moving along the kaluga road armies made their presence known but later when they reached the smolensk road they ran holding the clapper of their bell tight and often thinking they were escaping ran right into the russians 
 owing to the rapidity of the french flight and the russian pursuit and the consequent exhaustion of the horses the chief means of approximately ascertaining the position by cavalry scouting was not available besides as a result of the frequent and rapid change of position by each army even what information was obtained could not be delivered in time if news was received one day that the enemy had been in a certain position the day before by the third day when something could have been done that army was already two days march farther on and in quite another position 
 one army fled and the other pursued beyond smolensk there were several different roads available for the french and one would have thought that during their stay of four days they might have learned where the enemy was might have arranged some more advantageous plan and undertaken something new but after a four days halt the mob with no maneuvers or plans again began running along the beaten track neither to the right nor to the left but along the old the worst road through krasnoe and orsha 
 expecting the enemy from behind and not in front the french separated in their flight and spread out over a distance of hours in front of them all fled the emperor then the kings then the dukes the russian army expecting napoleon to take the road to the right beyond the dnieper which was the only reasonable thing for him to do themselves turned to the right and came out onto the highroad at krasnoe and here as in a game of buff the french ran into our vanguard seeing their enemy unexpectedly the french fell into confusion and stopped short from the sudden fright but then they resumed their flight abandoning their comrades who were farther behind then for three days separate portions of the french army first the then and then ran as it were the gauntlet of the russian army they abandoned one another abandoned all their heavy baggage their artillery and half their men and fled getting past the russians by night by making semicircles to the right 
 ney who came last had been busying himself blowing up the walls of smolensk which were in way because despite the unfortunate plight of the french or because of it they wished to punish the floor against which they had hurt themselves ney who had had a corps of ten thousand men reached napoleon at orsha with only one thousand men left having abandoned all the rest and all his cannon and having crossed the dnieper at night by stealth at a wooded spot 
 from orsha they fled farther along the road to vilna still playing at buff with the pursuing army at the berezina they again became disorganized many were drowned and many surrendered but those who got across the river fled farther their supreme chief donned a fur coat and having seated himself in a sleigh galloped on alone abandoning his companions the others who could do so drove away too leaving those who could not to surrender or die

 gavroche outside 
 courfeyrac suddenly caught sight of some one at the base of the barricade outside in the street amid the bullets 
 gavroche had taken a bottle basket from the had made his way out through the cut and was quietly engaged in emptying the full of the national guardsmen who had been killed on the slope of the redoubt into his basket 
 what are you doing there asked courfeyrac 
 gavroche raised his face 
 filling my basket citizen 
 you see the 
 gavroche replied 
 well it is raining 
 what then 
 courfeyrac in 
 instanter said gavroche 
 and with a single bound he plunged into the street 
 it will be remembered that company had left behind it a trail of bodies 
 twenty corpses lay scattered here and there on the pavement through the whole length of the street twenty cartouches for gavroche meant a provision of cartridges for the barricade 
 the smoke in the street was like a fog 
 whoever has beheld a cloud which has fallen into a mountain gorge between two peaked escarpments can imagine this smoke rendered denser and thicker by two gloomy rows of lofty houses 
 it rose gradually and was incessantly renewed hence a twilight which made even the broad daylight turn pale the combatants could hardly see each other from one end of the street to the other short as it was 
 this obscurity which had probably been desired and calculated on by the commanders who were to direct the assault on the barricade was useful to gavroche 
 beneath the folds of this veil of smoke and thanks to his small size he could advance tolerably far into the street without being seen he rifled the first seven or eight without much danger 
 he crawled flat on his belly galloped on all fours took his basket in his teeth twisted glided undulated wound from one dead body to another and emptied the or cartouche as a monkey opens a nut 
 they did not dare to shout to him to return from the barricade which was quite near for fear of attracting attention to him 
 on one body that of a corporal he found a 
 for thirst said he putting it in his pocket 
 by dint of advancing he reached a point where the fog of the fusillade became transparent 
 so that the sharpshooters of the line ranged on the outlook behind their dike and the sharpshooters of the banlieue massed at the corner of the street suddenly pointed out to each other something moving through the smoke 
 at the moment when gavroche was relieving a sergeant who was lying near a stone of his cartridges a bullet struck the body 
 fichtre ejaculated gavroche 
 they are killing my dead men for me 
 a second bullet struck a spark from the pavement beside him a third overturned his basket 
 gavroche looked and saw that this came from the men of the banlieue 
 he sprang to his feet stood erect with his hair flying in the wind his hands on his hips his eyes fixed on the national guardsmen who were firing and est laid a nanterre 
 men are ugly at nanterre 
 la faute a voltaire tis the 
 fault of voltaire 
 et bete a palaiseau 
 and dull at palaiseau 
 la faute a the fault of rousseau 
 then he picked up his basket replaced the cartridges which had fallen from it without missing a single one and advancing towards the fusillade set about plundering another there a fourth bullet missed him again 
 gavroche sang je ne suis pas notaire 
 i am not a notary la faute a the fault of voltaire je suis un petit oiseau 
 a little bird la faute a rousseau 
 tis the fault of rousseau a fifth bullet only succeeded in drawing from him a third couplet joie est mon caractere 
 joy is my character la faute a the fault of voltaire misere est mon trousseau misery is my trousseau la faute a rousseau 
 tis the fault of rousseau 
 thus it went on for some time 
 it was a charming and terrible sight 
 gavroche though shot at was teasing the fusillade 
 he had the air of being greatly diverted it was the sparrow pecking at the sportsmen 
 to each discharge he retorted with a couplet 
 they aimed at him constantly and always missed him 
 the national guardsmen and the soldiers laughed as they took aim at him 
 he lay down sprang to his feet hid in the corner of a doorway then made a bound disappeared scampered away returned replied to the with his thumb at his nose and all the while went on pillaging the cartouches emptying the and filling his basket the insurgents panting with anxiety followed him with their eyes the barricade trembled he sang 
 he was not a child he was not a man he was a strange he might have been called the invulnerable dwarf of the fray 
 the bullets flew after him he was more nimble than they 
 he played a fearful game of hide and seek with death every time that the face of the spectre approached the urchin administered to it a fillip 
 one bullet however better aimed or more treacherous than the rest finally struck the of a child 
 gavroche was seen 
 to stagger then he sank to the earth 
 the whole barricade gave vent to a cry but there was something of antaeus in that pygmy for the gamin to touch the pavement is the same as for the giant to touch the earth gavroche had fallen only to rise again he remained in a sitting posture a long thread of blood streaked his face he raised both arms in the air glanced in the direction whence the shot had come and began to sing 
 
 je suis tombe par terre i have fallen to the earth 
 la faute a the fault of voltaire 
 le nez dans le ruisseau 
 with my nose in the gutter 
 la faute a 
 tis the fault of 
 he did not finish 
 a second bullet from the same marksman stopped him short 
 this time he fell face downward on the pavement and moved no more 
 this grand little soul had taken its flight

 this campaign consisted in a flight of the french during which they did all they could to destroy themselves from the time they turned onto the kaluga road to the day their leader fled from the army none of the movements of the crowd had any sense so one might have thought that regarding this period of the campaign the historians who attributed the actions of the mass to the will of one man would have found it impossible to make the story of the retreat fit their theory but no mountains of books have been written by the historians about this campaign and everywhere are described arrangements the maneuvers and his profound plans which guided the army as well as the military genius shown by his marshals 
 the retreat from when he had a free road into a district and the parallel road was open to him along which kutuzov afterwards pursued him this unnecessary retreat along a devastated road is explained to us as being due to profound considerations similarly profound considerations are given for his retreat from smolensk to orsha then his heroism at krasnoe is described where he is reported to have been prepared to accept battle and take personal command and to have walked about with a birch stick and said 
 assez fait il est temps de faire le general but nevertheless immediately ran away again abandoning to its fate the scattered fragments of the army he left behind 
 i have acted the emperor long enough it is time to act the general 
 then we are told of the greatness of soul of the marshals especially of ney a greatness of soul consisting in this that he made his way by night around through the forest and across the dnieper and escaped to orsha abandoning standards artillery and nine tenths of his men 
 and lastly the final departure of the great emperor from his heroic army is presented to us by the historians as something great and characteristic of genius even that final running away described in ordinary language as the lowest depth of baseness which every child is taught to be ashamed of even that act finds justification in the historians language 
 when it is impossible to stretch the very elastic threads of historical ratiocination any farther when actions are clearly contrary to all that humanity calls right or even just the historians produce a saving conception of greatness greatness it seems excludes the standards of right and wrong for the great man nothing is wrong there is no atrocity for which a great man can be blamed 
 grand say the historians and there no longer exists either good or evil but only grand and not grand grand is good not grand is bad grand is the characteristic in their conception of some special animals called heroes and napoleon escaping home in a warm fur coat and leaving to perish those who were not merely his comrades but were in his opinion men he had brought there feels que grand and his soul is tranquil 
 it is great 
 that it is great 
 du sublime he saw something sublime in himself au ridicule il a pas said he and the whole world for fifty years has been repeating sublime grand napoleon le grand du sublime au ridicule il a pas 
 from the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step 
 and it occurs to no one that to admit a greatness not commensurable with the standard of right and wrong is merely to admit own nothingness and immeasurable meanness 
 for us with the standard of good and evil given us by christ no human actions are incommensurable and there is no greatness where simplicity goodness and truth are absent

 how from a brother one becomes a father 
 at that same moment in the garden of the the gaze of the drama must be everywhere children were holding each other by the hand 
 one might have been seven years old the other five 
 the rain having soaked them they were walking along the paths on the sunny side the elder was leading the younger they were pale and ragged they had the air of wild birds the smaller of them said 
 i am very hungry 
 the elder who was already somewhat of a protector was leading his brother with his left hand and in his right he carried a small stick 
 they were alone in the garden 
 the garden was deserted the gates had been closed by order of the police on account of the insurrection the troops who had been bivouacking there had departed for the exigencies of combat 
 how did those children come there 
 perhaps they had escaped from some which stood ajar perhaps there was in the vicinity at the barriere or on the esplanade de or in the neighboring carrefour dominated by the pediment on which could be read 
 invenerunt parvulum pannis involutum some booth from which they had fled perhaps they had on the preceding evening escaped the eye of the inspectors of the garden at the hour of closing and had passed the night in some one of those where people read the papers the fact is they were stray lambs and they seemed free 
 to be astray and to seem free is to be lost 
 these poor little creatures were in fact lost 
 these two children were the same over whom gavroche had been put to some trouble as the reader will recollect 
 children of the thenardiers leased out to magnon attributed to m gillenormand and now leaves fallen from all these rootless branches and swept over the ground by the wind 
 their clothing which had been clean in day and which had served her as a prospectus with m gillenormand had been converted into rags 
 henceforth these beings belonged to the statistics as abandoned children whom the police take note of collect mislay and find again on the pavements of paris 
 it required the disturbance of a day like that to account for these miserable little creatures being in that garden 
 if the superintendents had caught sight of them they would have driven such rags forth poor little things do not enter public gardens still people should reflect that as children they have a right to flowers 
 these children were there thanks to the locked gates 
 they were there contrary to the regulations 
 they had slipped into the garden and there they remained 
 closed gates do not dismiss the inspectors oversight is supposed to continue but it grows slack and reposes and the inspectors moved by the public anxiety and more occupied with the outside than the inside no longer glanced into the garden and had not seen the two delinquents 
 it had rained the night before and even a little in the morning but in june showers do not count for much 
 an hour after a storm it can hardly be seen that the beautiful blonde day has wept the earth in summer is as quickly dried as the cheek of a child at that period of the solstice the light of full noonday is so to speak poignant 
 it takes everything 
 it applies itself to the earth and superposes itself with a sort of suction 
 one would say that the sun was thirsty 
 a shower is but a glass of water a rainstorm is instantly drunk up 
 in the morning everything was dripping in the afternoon everything is powdered over 
 nothing is so worthy of admiration as foliage washed by the rain and wiped by the rays of sunlight it is warm freshness 
 the gardens and meadows having water at their roots and sun in their flowers become of incense and smoke with all their odors at once 
 everything smiles sings and offers itself 
 one feels gently intoxicated 
 the springtime is a provisional paradise the sun helps man to have patience 
 there are beings who demand nothing further mortals who having the azure of heaven say 
 it is enough dreamers absorbed in the wonderful dipping into the idolatry of nature indifferent to good and evil contemplators of cosmos and radiantly forgetful of man who do not understand how people can occupy themselves with the hunger of these and the thirst of those with the nudity of the poor in winter with the lymphatic curvature of the little spinal column with the pallet the attic the dungeon and the rags of shivering young girls when they can dream beneath the trees peaceful and terrible spirits they and pitilessly satisfied strange to say the infinite suffices them 
 that great need of man the finite which admits of embrace they ignore 
 the finite which admits of progress and sublime toil they do not think about the indefinite which is born from the human and divine combination of the infinite and the finite escapes them 
 provided that they are face to face with immensity they smile 
 joy never ecstasy forever their life lies in surrendering their personality in contemplation the history of humanity is for them only a detailed plan 
 all is not there the true all remains without what is the use of busying oneself over that detail man 
 man suffers that is quite possible but look at aldebaran rising 
 the mother has no more milk the babe is dying 
 i know nothing about that but just look at this wonderful rosette which a slice of of the pine presents under the microscope 
 compare the most beautiful mechlin lace to that if you can 
 these thinkers forget to love the zodiac thrives with them to such a point that it prevents their seeing the weeping child 
 god eclipses their souls this is a family of minds which are at once great and petty horace was one of them so was goethe 
 la fontaine perhaps magnificent egoists of the infinite tranquil spectators of sorrow who do not behold nero if the weather be fair for whom the sun conceals the funeral pile who would look on at an execution by the guillotine in the search for an effect of light who hear neither the cry nor the sob nor the death rattle nor the alarm peal for whom everything is well since there is a month of may who so long as there are clouds of purple and gold above their heads declare themselves content and who are determined to be happy until the radiance of the stars and the songs of the birds are exhausted 
 these are dark radiances 
 they have no suspicion that they are to be pitied 
 certainly they are so 
 he who does not weep does not see 
 they are to be admired and pitied as one would both pity and admire a being at once night and day without eyes beneath his lashes but with a star on his brow 
 the indifference of these thinkers is according to some a superior philosophy 
 that may be but in this superiority there is some infirmity 
 one may be immortal and yet limp witness vulcan 
 one may be more than man and less than man there is incomplete immensity in nature 
 who knows whether the sun is not a blind man 
 but then what 
 in whom can we trust 
 solem quis dicere falsum audeat who shall dare to say that the sun is false 
 thus certain geniuses themselves certain mortals may be mistaken that which is on high at the summit at the crest at the zenith that which sends down so much light on the earth sees but little sees badly sees not at all 
 is not this a desperate state of things no but what is there then above the sun 
 the god 
 on the th of june about eleven in the morning the luxembourg solitary and depopulated was charming the quincunxes and shed forth balm and dazzling beauty into the sunlight 
 the branches wild with the brilliant glow of midday seemed endeavoring to embrace 
 in the sycamores there was an uproar of linnets sparrows triumphed woodpeckers climbed along the chestnut trees administering little pecks on the bark the accepted the legitimate royalty of the lilies the most august of perfumes is that which emanates from whiteness the peppery odor of the carnations was perceptible 
 the old crows of marie de medici were amorous in the tall trees 
 the sun gilded empurpled set fire to and lighted up the tulips which are nothing but all the varieties of flame made into flowers 
 all around the banks of tulips the bees the sparks of these hummed all was grace and gayety even the impending rain this relapse by which the lilies of the valley and the honeysuckles were destined to profit had nothing disturbing about it the swallows indulged in the charming threat of flying low 
 he who was there aspired to happiness life smelled good all nature exhaled candor help assistance paternity caress dawn 
 the thoughts which fell from heaven were as sweet as the tiny hand of a baby when one kisses it 
 the statues under the trees white and nude had robes of shadow pierced with light these goddesses were all tattered with sunlight rays hung from them on all sides 
 around the great fountain the earth was already dried up to the point of being burnt there was sufficient breeze to raise little insurrections of dust here and there 
 a few yellow leaves left over from the autumn chased each other merrily and seemed to be playing tricks on each other 
 this abundance of light had something indescribably reassuring about it 
 life sap heat odors overflowed one was conscious beneath creation of the enormous size of the source in all these breaths permeated with love in this interchange of reverberations and reflections in this marvellous expenditure of rays in this infinite outpouring of liquid gold one felt the prodigality of the inexhaustible and behind this splendor as behind a curtain of flame one caught a glimpse of god that millionaire of stars 
 thanks to the sand there was not a speck of mud thanks to the rain there was not a grain of ashes 
 the clumps of blossoms had just been bathed every sort of velvet satin gold and varnish which springs from the earth in the form of flowers was irreproachable this magnificence was cleanly 
 the grand silence of happy nature filled the garden 
 a celestial silence that is compatible with a thousand sorts of music the cooing of nests the buzzing of swarms the flutterings of the breeze 
 all the harmony of the season was complete in one gracious whole the entrances and exits of spring took place in proper order the lilacs ended the jasmines began some flowers were tardy some insects in advance of their time the of the red june butterflies fraternized with the of the white butterflies of may 
 the plantain trees were getting their new skins 
 the breeze hollowed out undulations in the magnificent enormity of the it was splendid a veteran from the neighboring barracks who was gazing through the fence said 
 here is the spring presenting arms and in full uniform 
 all nature was breakfasting creation was at table this was its hour the great blue cloth was spread in the sky and the great green cloth on earth the sun lighted it all up brilliantly 
 god was serving the universal repast 
 each creature had his pasture or his mess the found his the chaffinch found his millet the goldfinch found chickweed the found worms the green finch found flies the fly found infusoriae the bee found flowers they ate each other somewhat it is true which is the misery of evil mixed with good but not a beast of them all had an empty stomach 
 the two little abandoned creatures had arrived in the vicinity of the grand fountain and rather bewildered by all this light they tried to hide themselves the instinct of the poor and the weak in the presence of even impersonal magnificence and they kept behind the swans hutch 
 here and there at intervals when the wind blew shouts clamor a sort of tumultuous death rattle which was the firing and dull blows which were discharges of cannon struck the ear confusedly smoke hung over the roofs in the direction of the halles 
 a bell which had the air of an appeal was ringing in the distance 
 these children did not appear to notice these noises 
 the little one repeated from time to time 
 i am hungry 
 almost at the same instant with the children another couple approached the great basin 
 they consisted of a goodman about fifty years of age who was leading by the hand a little fellow of six 
 no doubt a father and his son 
 the little man of six had a big brioche 
 at that epoch certain houses abutting on the river in the rues madame and had keys to the luxembourg garden of which the lodgers enjoyed the use when the gates were shut a privilege which was suppressed later on 
 this father and son came from one of these houses no doubt 
 the two poor little creatures watched that gentleman approaching and hid themselves a little more thoroughly 
 he was a bourgeois 
 the same person perhaps whom marius had one day heard through his love fever near the same grand basin counselling his son to avoid excesses 
 he had an affable and haughty air and a mouth which was always smiling since it did not shut this mechanical smile produced by too much jaw and too little skin shows the teeth rather than the soul 
 the child with his brioche which he had bitten into but had not finished eating seemed satiated the child was dressed as a national guardsman owing to the insurrection and the father had remained clad as a bourgeois out of prudence 
 father and son halted near the fountain where two swans were sporting this bourgeois appeared to cherish a special admiration for the swans he resembled them in this sense that he walked like them 
 for the moment the swans were swimming which is their principal talent and they were superb 
 if the two poor little beings had listened and if they had been of an age to understand they might have gathered the words of this grave man 
 the father was saying to his son 
 the sage lives content with little 
 look at me my son 
 i do not love pomp 
 i am never seen in clothes decked with gold lace and stones i leave that false splendor to badly organized souls 
 here the deep shouts which proceeded from the direction of the halles burst out with fresh force of bell and uproar 
 what is that inquired the child 
 the father replied 
 it is the saturnalia 
 all at once he caught sight of the two little ragged boys behind the green 
 there is the beginning said he 
 and after a pause he added 
 anarchy is entering this garden 
 in the meanwhile his son took a bite of his brioche spit it out and suddenly burst out crying 
 what are you crying about demanded his father 
 i am not hungry any more said the child 
 the smile became more accentuated 
 one does not need to be hungry in order to eat a cake 
 my cake tires me 
 it is stale 
 you want any more of it 
 no 
 the father pointed to the swans 
 throw it to those palmipeds 
 the child hesitated 
 a person may not want any more of his cake but that is no reason for giving it away 
 the father went on 
 be humane 
 you must have compassion on animals 
 and taking the cake from his son he flung it into the basin 
 the cake fell very near the edge 
 the swans were far away in the centre of the basin and busy with some prey 
 they had seen neither the bourgeois nor the brioche 
 the bourgeois feeling that the cake was in danger of being wasted and moved by this useless shipwreck entered upon a telegraphic agitation which finally attracted the attention of the swans 
 they perceived something floating steered for the edge like ships as they are and slowly directed their course toward the brioche with the stupid majesty which befits white creatures 
 the swans cygnes understand signs signes said the bourgeois delighted to make a jest 
 at that moment the distant tumult of the city underwent another sudden increase 
 this time it was sinister 
 there are some gusts of wind which speak more distinctly than others 
 the one which was blowing at that moment brought clearly defined clamors platoon firing and the dismal replies of the tocsin and the cannon this coincided with a black cloud which suddenly veiled the sun 
 the swans had not yet reached the brioche 
 let us return home said the father they are attacking the tuileries 
 he grasped his hand again 
 then he continued 
 from the tuileries to the luxembourg there is but the distance which separates royalty from the peerage that is not far shots will soon rain down 
 he glanced at the cloud 
 perhaps it is rain itself that is about to shower down the sky is joining in the younger branch is condemned 
 let us return home quickly 
 i should like to see the swans eat the brioche said the child 
 the father replied 
 that would be imprudent 
 and he led his little bourgeois away 
 the son regretting the swans turned his head back toward the basin until a corner of the quincunxes concealed it from him 
 in the meanwhile the two little waifs had approached the brioche at the same time as the swans 
 it was floating on the water the smaller of them stared at the cake the elder gazed after the retreating bourgeois 
 father and son entered the labyrinth of walks which leads to the grand flight of steps near the clump of trees on the side of the rue madame 
 as soon as they had disappeared from view the elder child hastily flung himself flat on his stomach on the rounding curb of the basin and clinging to it with his left hand and leaning over the water on the verge of falling in he stretched out his right hand with his stick towards the cake 
 the swans perceiving the enemy made haste and in so doing they produced an effect of their breasts which was of service to the little fisher the water flowed back before the swans and one of these gentle concentric undulations softly floated the brioche towards the wand 
 just as the swans came up the stick touched the cake 
 the child gave it a brisk rap drew in the brioche frightened away the swans seized the cake and sprang to his feet 
 the cake was wet but they were hungry and thirsty the elder broke the cake into two portions a large one and a small one took the small one for himself gave the large one to his brother and said to him 
 ram that into your muzzle

 what russian reading the account of the last part of the campaign of has not experienced an uncomfortable feeling of regret dissatisfaction and perplexity who has not asked himself how it is that the french were not all captured or destroyed when our three armies surrounded them in superior numbers when the disordered french hungry and freezing surrendered in crowds and when as the historians relate the aim of the russians was to stop the french to cut them off and capture them all 
 how was it that the russian army which when numerically weaker than the french had given battle at borodino did not achieve its purpose when it had surrounded the french on three sides and when its aim was to capture them can the french be so enormously superior to us that when we had surrounded them with superior forces we could not beat them how could that happen 
 history or what is called by that name replying to these questions says that this occurred because kutuzov and tormasov and chichagov and this man and that man did not execute such and such maneuvers 
 but why did they not execute those maneuvers and why if they were guilty of not carrying out a prearranged plan were they not tried and punished but even if we admitted that kutuzov chichagov and others were the cause of the russian failures it is still incomprehensible why the position of the russian army being what it was at krasnoe and at the berezina in both cases we had superior forces the french army with its marshals kings and emperor was not captured if that was what the russians aimed at 
 the explanation of this strange fact given by russian military historians to the effect that kutuzov hindered an attack is unfounded for we know that he could not restrain the troops from attacking at vyazma and tarutino 
 why was the russian army which with inferior forces had withstood the enemy in full strength at borodino defeated at krasnoe and the berezina by the disorganized crowds of the french when it was numerically superior 
 if the aim of the russians consisted in cutting off and capturing napoleon and his marshals and that aim was not merely frustrated but all attempts to attain it were most shamefully baffled then this last period of the campaign is quite rightly considered by the french to be a series of victories and quite wrongly considered victorious by russian historians 
 the russian military historians in so far as they submit to claims of logic must admit that conclusion and in spite of their lyrical rhapsodies about valor devotion and so forth must reluctantly admit that the french retreat from moscow was a series of victories for napoleon and defeats for kutuzov 
 but putting national vanity entirely aside one feels that such a conclusion involves a contradiction since the series of french victories brought the french complete destruction while the series of russian defeats led to the total destruction of their enemy and the liberation of their country 
 the source of this contradiction lies in the fact that the historians studying the events from the letters of the sovereigns and the generals from memoirs reports projects and so forth have attributed to this last period of the war of an aim that never existed namely that of cutting off and capturing napoleon with his marshals and his army 
 there never was or could have been such an aim for it would have been senseless and its attainment quite impossible 
 it would have been senseless first because disorganized army was flying from russia with all possible speed that is to say was doing just what every russian desired so what was the use of performing various operations on the french who were running away as fast as they possibly could 
 secondly it would have been senseless to block the passage of men whose whole energy was directed to flight 
 thirdly it would have been senseless to sacrifice own troops in order to destroy the french army which without external interference was destroying itself at such a rate that though its path was not blocked it could not carry across the frontier more than it actually did in december namely a hundredth part of the original army 
 fourthly it would have been senseless to wish to take captive the emperor kings and dukes whose capture would have been in the highest degree embarrassing for the russians as the most adroit diplomatists of the time joseph de maistre and others recognized still more senseless would have been the wish to capture army corps of the french when our own army had melted away to half before reaching krasnoe and a whole division would have been needed to convoy the corps of prisoners and when our men were not always getting full rations and the prisoners already taken were perishing of hunger 
 all the profound plans about cutting off and capturing napoleon and his army were like the plan of a market gardener who when driving out of his garden a cow that had trampled down the beds he had planted should run to the gate and hit the cow on the head the only thing to be said in excuse of that gardener would be that he was very angry but not even that could be said for those who drew up this project for it was not they who had suffered from the trampled beds 
 but besides the fact that cutting off napoleon with his army would have been senseless it was impossible 
 it was impossible first because as experience shows that a movement of columns on a battlefield never coincides with the plans the probability of chichagov kutuzov and wittgenstein effecting a junction on time at an appointed place was so remote as to be tantamount to impossibility as in fact thought kutuzov who when he received the plan remarked that diversions planned over great distances do not yield the desired results 
 secondly it was impossible because to paralyze the momentum with which army was retiring incomparably greater forces than the russians possessed would have been required 
 thirdly it was impossible because the military term to cut off has no meaning one can cut off a slice of bread but not an army to cut off an army to bar its road is quite impossible for there is always plenty of room to avoid capture and there is the night when nothing can be seen as the military scientists might convince themselves by the example of krasnoe and of the berezina it is only possible to capture prisoners if they agree to be captured just as it is only possible to catch a swallow if it settles on hand men can only be taken prisoners if they surrender according to the rules of strategy and tactics as the germans did but the french troops quite rightly did not consider that this suited them since death by hunger and cold awaited them in flight or captivity alike 
 fourthly and chiefly it was impossible because never since the world began has a war been fought under such conditions as those that obtained in and the russian army in its pursuit of the french strained its strength to the utmost and could not have done more without destroying itself 
 during the movement of the russian army from tarutino to krasnoe it lost fifty thousand sick or stragglers that is a number equal to the population of a large provincial town half the men fell out of the army without a battle 
 and it is of this period of the campaign when the army lacked boots and sheepskin coats was short of provisions and without vodka and was camping out at night for months in the snow with fifteen degrees of frost when there were only seven or eight hours of daylight and the rest was night in which the influence of discipline cannot be maintained when men were taken into that region of death where discipline fails not for a few hours only as in a battle but for months where they were every moment fighting death from hunger and cold when half the army perished in a single month it is of this period of the campaign that the historians tell us how miloradovich should have made a flank march to such and such a place tormasov to another place and chichagov should have crossed more than in snow to somewhere else and how routed and cut off the french and so on and so on 
 the russians half of whom died did all that could and should have been done to attain an end worthy of the nation and they are not to blame because other russians sitting in warm rooms proposed that they should do what was impossible 
 all that strange contradiction now difficult to understand between the facts and the historical accounts only arises because the historians dealing with the matter have written the history of the beautiful words and sentiments of various generals and not the history of the events 
 to them the words of miloradovich seem very interesting and so do their surmises and the rewards this or that general received but the question of those fifty thousand men who were left in hospitals and in graves does not even interest them for it does not come within the range of their investigation 
 yet one need only discard the study of the reports and general plans and consider the movement of those hundreds of thousands of men who took a direct part in the events and all the questions that seemed insoluble easily and simply receive an immediate and certain solution 
 the aim of cutting off napoleon and his army never existed except in the imaginations of a dozen people it could not exist because it was senseless and unattainable 
 the people had a single aim to free their land from invasion that aim was attained in the first place of itself as the french ran away and so it was only necessary not to stop their flight secondly it was attained by the guerrilla warfare which was destroying the french and thirdly by the fact that a large russian army was following the french ready to use its strength in case their movement stopped 
 the russian army had to act like a whip to a running animal and the experienced driver knew it was better to hold the whip raised as a menace than to strike the running animal on the head

 mortuus pater filium moriturum expectat 
 marius dashed out of the barricade combeferre followed him but he was too late 
 gavroche was dead 
 combeferre brought back the basket of cartridges marius bore the child 
 alas he thought that which the father had done for his father he was requiting to the son only thenardier had brought back his father alive he was bringing back the child dead 
 when marius the redoubt with gavroche in his arms his face like the child was inundated with blood 
 at the moment when he had stooped to lift gavroche a bullet had grazed his head he had not noticed it 
 courfeyrac untied his cravat and with it bandaged marius brow 
 they laid gavroche on the same table with mabeuf and spread over the two corpses the black shawl 
 there was enough of it for both the old man and the child 
 combeferre distributed the cartridges from the basket which he had brought in 
 this gave each man fifteen rounds to fire 
 jean valjean was still in the same place motionless on his stone post 
 when combeferre offered him his fifteen cartridges he shook his head 
 a rare eccentric said combeferre in a low voice to enjolras he finds a way of not fighting in this barricade 
 which does not prevent him from defending it responded enjolras 
 heroism has its originals resumed combeferre 
 and courfeyrac who had overheard added 
 he is another sort from father mabeuf 
 one thing which must be noted is that the fire which was battering the barricade hardly disturbed the interior 
 those who have never traversed the whirlwind of this sort of war can form no idea of the singular moments of tranquillity mingled with these convulsions men go and come they talk they jest they lounge 
 some one whom we know heard a combatant say to him in the midst of the we are here as at a bachelor breakfast 
 the redoubt of the rue de la chanvrerie we repeat seemed very calm within 
 all mutations and all phases had been or were about to be exhausted 
 the position from critical had become menacing and from menacing was probably about to become desperate 
 in proportion as the situation grew gloomy the glow of heroism empurpled the barricade more and more enjolras who was grave dominated it in the attitude of a young spartan sacrificing his naked sword to the sombre genius epidotas 
 combeferre wearing an apron was dressing the wounds bossuet and feuilly were making cartridges with the picked up by gavroche on the dead corporal and bossuet said to feuilly 
 we are soon to take the diligence for another planet courfeyrac was disposing and arranging on some which he had reserved for himself near enjolras a complete arsenal his his gun two holster pistols and a cudgel with the care of a young girl setting a small dunkerque in order jean valjean stared silently at the wall opposite him 
 an artisan was fastening mother big straw hat on his head with a string for fear of as he said 
 the young men from the cougourde were chatting merrily among themselves as though eager to speak patois for the last time 
 joly who had taken widow mirror from the wall was examining his tongue in it 
 some combatants having discovered a few crusts of rather mouldy bread in a drawer were eagerly devouring them marius was disturbed with regard to what his father was about to say to him

 book fifteen 
 chapter i 
 
 when seeing a dying animal a man feels a sense of horror substance similar to his own is perishing before his eyes but when it is a beloved and intimate human being that is dying besides this horror at the extinction of life there is a severance a spiritual wound which like a physical wound is sometimes fatal and sometimes heals but always aches and shrinks at any external irritating touch 
 after prince death natasha and princess mary alike felt this drooping in spirit and closing their eyes before the menacing cloud of death that overhung them they dared not look life in the face they carefully guarded their open wounds from any rough and painful contact everything a carriage passing rapidly in the street a summons to dinner the inquiry what dress to prepare or worse still any word of insincere or feeble sympathy seemed an insult painfully irritated the wound interrupting that necessary quiet in which they both tried to listen to the stern and dreadful choir that still resounded in their imagination and hindered their gazing into those mysterious limitless vistas that for an instant had opened out before them 
 only when alone together were they free from such outrage and pain they spoke little even to one another and when they did it was of very unimportant matters 
 both avoided any allusion to the future to admit the possibility of a future seemed to them to insult his memory still more carefully did they avoid anything relating to him who was dead it seemed to them that what they had lived through and experienced could not be expressed in words and that any reference to the details of his life infringed the majesty and sacredness of the mystery that had been accomplished before their eyes 
 continued abstention from speech and constant avoidance of everything that might lead up to the subject this halting on all sides at the boundary of what they might not mention brought before their minds with still greater purity and clearness what they were both feeling 
 but pure and complete sorrow is as impossible as pure and complete joy princess mary in her position as absolute and independent arbiter of her own fate and guardian and instructor of her nephew was the first to be called back to life from that realm of sorrow in which she had dwelt for the first fortnight she received letters from her relations to which she had to reply the room in which little nicholas had been put was damp and he began to cough alpatych came to yaroslavl with reports on the state of their affairs and with advice and suggestions that they should return to moscow to the house on the vozdvizhenka street which had remained uninjured and needed only slight repairs life did not stand still and it was necessary to live hard as it was for princess mary to emerge from the realm of secluded contemplation in which she had lived till then and sorry and almost ashamed as she felt to leave natasha alone yet the cares of life demanded her attention and she involuntarily yielded to them she went through the accounts with alpatych conferred with dessalles about her nephew and gave orders and made preparations for the journey to moscow 
 natasha remained alone and from the time princess mary began making preparations for departure held aloof from her too 
 princess mary asked the countess to let natasha go with her to moscow and both parents gladly accepted this offer for they saw their daughter losing strength every day and thought that a change of scene and the advice of moscow doctors would be good for her 
 i am not going anywhere natasha replied when this was proposed to her do please just leave me alone and she ran out of the room with difficulty refraining from tears of vexation and irritation rather than of sorrow 
 after she felt herself deserted by princes mary and alone in her grief natasha spent most of the time in her room by herself sitting huddled up feet and all in the corner of the sofa tearing and twisting something with her slender nervous fingers and gazing intently and fixedly at whatever her eyes chanced to fall on this solitude exhausted and tormented her but she was in absolute need of it as soon as anyone entered she got up quickly changed her position and expression and picked up a book or some sewing evidently waiting impatiently for the intruder to go 
 she felt all the time as if she might at any moment penetrate that on which with a terrible questioning too great for her strength her spiritual gaze was fixed 
 one day toward the end of december natasha pale and thin dressed in a black woolen gown her plaited hair negligently twisted into a knot was crouched feet and all in the corner of her sofa nervously crumpling and smoothing out the end of her sash while she looked at a corner of the door 
 she was gazing in the direction in which he had gone to the other side of life and that other side of life of which she had never before thought and which had formerly seemed to her so far away and improbable was now nearer and more akin and more comprehensible than this side of life where everything was either emptiness and desolation or suffering and indignity 
 she was gazing where she knew him to be but she could not imagine him otherwise than as he had been here she now saw him again as he had been at mytishchi at troitsa and at yaroslavl 
 she saw his face heard his voice repeated his words and her own and sometimes devised other words they might have spoken 
 there he is lying back in an armchair in his velvet cloak leaning his head on his thin pale hand his chest is dreadfully hollow and his shoulders raised his lips are firmly closed his eyes glitter and a wrinkle comes and goes on his pale forehead one of his legs twitches just perceptibly but rapidly natasha knows that he is struggling with terrible pain what is that pain like why does he have that pain what does he feel how does it hurt him thought natasha he noticed her watching him raised his eyes and began to speak seriously 
 one thing would be terrible said he to bind oneself forever to a suffering man it would be continual torture and he looked searchingly at her natasha as usual answered before she had time to think what she would say she said this go on it you will get well quite well 
 she now saw him from the commencement of that scene and relived what she had then felt she recalled his long sad and severe look at those words and understood the meaning of the rebuke and despair in that protracted gaze 
 i agreed natasha now said to herself that it would be dreadful if he always continued to suffer i said it then only because it would have been dreadful for him but he understood it differently he thought it would be dreadful for me he then still wished to live and feared death and i said it so awkwardly and stupidly i did not say what i meant i thought quite differently had i said what i thought i should have said even if he had to go on dying to die continually before my eyes i should have been happy compared with what i am now now there is nothing nobody did he know that no he did not and never will know it and now it will never never be possible to put it right and now he again seemed to be saying the same words to her only in her imagination natasha this time gave him a different answer she stopped him and said terrible for you but not for me you know that for me there is nothing in life but you and to suffer with you is the greatest happiness for me and he took her hand and pressed it as he had pressed it that terrible evening four days before his death and in her imagination she said other tender and loving words which she might have said then but only spoke now i love thee thee i love love she said convulsively pressing her hands and setting her teeth with a desperate effort 
 she was overcome by sweet sorrow and tears were already rising in her eyes then she suddenly asked herself to whom she was saying this again everything was shrouded in hard dry perplexity and again with a strained frown she peered toward the world where he was and now now it seemed to her she was penetrating the mystery but at the instant when it seemed that the incomprehensible was revealing itself to her a loud rattle of the door handle struck painfully on her ears dunyasha her maid entered the room quickly and abruptly with a frightened look on her face and showing no concern for her mistress 
 come to your papa at once please said she with a strange excited look a misfortune about peter ilynich a letter she finished with a sob

 the vulture become prey 
 we must insist upon one psychological fact peculiar to barricades nothing which is characteristic of that surprising war of the streets should be omitted 
 whatever may have been the singular inward tranquillity which we have just mentioned the barricade for those who are inside it remains none the less a vision 
 there is something of the apocalypse in civil war all the mists of the unknown are commingled with fierce flashes revolutions are sphinxes and any one who has passed through a barricade thinks he has traversed a dream 
 the feelings to which one is subject in these places we have pointed out in the case of marius and we shall see the consequences they are both more and less than life 
 on emerging from a barricade one no longer knows what one has seen there 
 one has been terrible but one knows it not 
 one has been surrounded with conflicting ideas which had human faces head has been in the light of the future there were corpses lying prone there and phantoms standing erect the hours were colossal and seemed hours of eternity 
 one has lived in death 
 shadows have passed by 
 what were they 
 one has beheld hands on which there was blood there was a deafening horror there was also a frightful silence there were open mouths which shouted and other open mouths which held their peace one was in the midst of smoke of night perhaps 
 one fancied that one had touched the sinister ooze of unknown depths one stares at something red on finger nails 
 one no longer remembers anything 
 let us return to the rue de la chanvrerie 
 all at once between two discharges the distant sound of a clock striking the hour became audible 
 it is midday said combeferre 
 the twelve strokes had not finished striking when enjolras sprang to his feet and from the summit of the barricade hurled this thundering shout 
 carry stones up into the houses line the windowsills and the roofs with them 
 half the men to their guns the other half to the there is not a minute to be lost 
 a squad of sappers and miners axe on shoulder had just made their appearance in battle array at the end of the street 
 this could only be the head of a column and of what column the attacking column evidently the sappers charged with the demolition of the barricade must always precede the soldiers who are to scale it 
 they were evidently on the brink of that moment which m in called the tug of war 
 enjolras order was executed with the correct haste which is peculiar to ships and barricades the only two scenes of combat where escape is impossible 
 in less than a minute two thirds of the stones which enjolras had had piled up at the door of corinthe had been carried up to the first floor and the attic and before a second minute had elapsed these stones artistically set one upon the other walled up the on the first floor and the windows in the roof to half their height 
 a few carefully planned by feuilly the principal architect allowed of the passage of the this armament of the windows could be effected all the more easily since the firing of had ceased the two cannons were now discharging ball against the centre of the barrier in order to make a hole there and if possible a breach for the assault 
 when the stones destined to the final defence were in place enjolras had the bottles which he had set under the table where mabeuf lay carried to the first floor 
 who is to drink that 
 bossuet asked him 
 they replied enjolras 
 then they barricaded the window below and held in readiness the iron which served to secure the door of the at night 
 the fortress was complete 
 the barricade was the rampart the was the dungeon 
 with the stones which remained they stopped up the outlet 
 as the defenders of a barricade are always obliged to be sparing of their ammunition and as the assailants know this the assailants combine their arrangements with a sort of irritating leisure expose themselves to fire prematurely though in appearance more than in reality and take their ease 
 the preparations for attack are always made with a certain methodical deliberation after which the lightning strikes 
 this deliberation permitted enjolras to take a review of everything and to perfect everything 
 he felt that since such men were to die their death ought to be a masterpiece 
 he said to marius 
 we are the two leaders 
 i will give the last orders inside 
 do you remain outside and observe 
 marius posted himself on the lookout upon the crest of the barricade 
 enjolras had the door of the kitchen which was the ambulance as the reader will remember nailed up 
 no splashing of the wounded he said 
 he issued his final orders in the in a curt but profoundly tranquil tone feuilly listened and replied in the name of all 
 on the first floor hold your axes in readiness to cut the staircase have you them 
 yes said feuilly 
 how many 
 two axes and a 
 that is good 
 there are now combatants of us on foot how many guns are there 
 
 eight too many 
 keep those eight guns loaded like the rest and at hand swords and pistols in your belts 
 twenty men to the barricade six ambushed in the attic windows and at the window on the first floor to fire on the assailants through the in the stones let not a single worker remain inactive here 
 presently when the drum beats the assault let the twenty below stairs rush to the barricade the first to arrive will have the best places 
 these arrangements made he turned to javert and said 
 i am not forgetting you 
 and laying a pistol on the table he added 
 the last man to leave this room will smash the skull of this spy 
 here inquired a voice 
 no let us not mix their corpses with our own 
 the little barricade of the mondetour lane can be scaled 
 it is only four feet high the man is well pinioned 
 he shall be taken thither and put to death 
 there was some one who was more impassive at that moment than enjolras it was javert 
 here jean valjean made his appearance 
 he had been lost among the group of insurgents 
 he stepped forth and said to enjolras 
 you are the commander 
 yes 
 you thanked me a while ago 
 in the name of the republic 
 the barricade has two saviors marius pontmercy and yourself 
 do you think that i deserve a recompense 
 certainly 
 well i request one 
 what is it 
 that i may blow that brains out 
 javert raised his head saw jean valjean made an almost imperceptible movement and said 
 that is just 
 as for enjolras he had begun to his rifle he cut his eyes about him 
 no objections 
 and he turned to jean valjean 
 take the spy 
 jean valjean did in fact take possession of javert by seating himself on the end of the table 
 he seized the pistol and a faint click announced that he had cocked it

 book fifteen 
 chapter ii 
 
 besides a feeling of aloofness from everybody natasha was feeling a special estrangement from the members of her own family all of them her father mother and sonya were so near to her so familiar so commonplace that all their words and feelings seemed an insult to the world in which she had been living of late and she felt not merely indifferent to them but regarded them with hostility she heard words about peter ilynich and a misfortune but did not grasp them 
 what misfortune what misfortune can happen to them they just live their own old quiet and commonplace life thought natasha 
 as she entered the ballroom her father was hurriedly coming out of her room his face was puckered up and wet with tears he had evidently run out of that room to give vent to the sobs that were choking him when he saw natasha he waved his arms despairingly and burst into convulsively painful sobs that distorted his soft round face 
 pe petya go go she is calling and weeping like a child and quickly shuffling on his feeble legs to a chair he almost fell into it covering his face with his hands 
 suddenly an electric shock seemed to run through whole being terrible anguish struck her heart she felt a dreadful ache as if something was being torn inside her and she were dying but the pain was immediately followed by a feeling of release from the oppressive constraint that had prevented her taking part in life the sight of her father the terribly wild cries of her mother that she heard through the door made her immediately forget herself and her own grief 
 she ran to her father but he feebly waved his arm pointing to her door princess mary pale and with quivering chin came out from that room and taking natasha by the arm said something to her natasha neither saw nor heard her she went in with rapid steps pausing at the door for an instant as if struggling with herself and then ran to her mother 
 the countess was lying in an armchair in a strange and awkward position stretching out and beating her head against the wall sonya and the maids were holding her arms 
 natasha natasha cried the countess not true not true lying natasha she shrieked pushing those around her away go away all of you not true killed ha ha ha not true 
 natasha put one knee on the armchair stooped over her mother embraced her and with unexpected strength raised her turned her face toward herself and clung to her 
 mummy darling i am here my dearest mummy she kept on whispering not pausing an instant 
 she did not let go of her mother but struggled tenderly with her demanded a pillow and hot water and unfastened and tore open her dress 
 my dearest darling mummy my precious she whispered incessantly kissing her head her hands her face and feeling her own irrepressible and streaming tears tickling her nose and cheeks 
 the countess pressed her hand closed her eyes and became quiet for a moment suddenly she sat up with unaccustomed swiftness glanced vacantly around her and seeing natasha began to press her head with all her strength then she turned toward her face which was wincing with pain and gazed long at it 
 natasha you love me she said in a soft trustful whisper natasha you would not deceive me tell me the whole truth 
 natasha looked at her with eyes full of tears and in her look there was nothing but love and an entreaty for forgiveness 
 my darling mummy she repeated straining all the power of her love to find some way of taking on herself the excess of grief that crushed her mother 
 and again in a futile struggle with reality her mother refusing to believe that she could live when her beloved boy was killed in the bloom of life escaped from reality into a world of delirium 
 natasha did not remember how that day passed nor that night nor the next day and night she did not sleep and did not leave her mother her persevering and patient love seemed completely to surround the countess every moment not explaining or consoling but recalling her to life 
 during the third night the countess kept very quiet for a few minutes and natasha rested her head on the arm of her chair and closed her eyes but opened them again on hearing the bedstead creak the countess was sitting up in bed and speaking softly 
 how glad i am you have come you are tired you have some tea natasha went up to her you have improved in looks and grown more manly continued the countess taking her hand 
 mamma what are you saying 
 natasha he is no more no more 
 and embracing her daughter the countess began to weep for the first time

 of suspicion 
 suspicions amongst thoughts are like bats amongst birds they ever fly by twilight 
 certainly they are to be repressed or at the least well guarded for they cloud 
 the mind they lose mends and they check with business whereby business cannot go on currently and constantly they dispose kings to tyranny husbands to jealousy wise men to irresolution and melancholy they are defects not in the heart but in the brain for they take place in the stoutest natures as in the example of henry the seventh of england there was not a more suspicious man nor a more stout 
 and in such a composition they do small hurt for commonly they are not admitted but with examination whether they be likely or no but in fearful natures they gain ground too fast there is nothing makes a man suspect much more than to know lime and therefore men should remedy suspicion by procuring to know more and not to keep their suspicions in smother what would men have do they think those they employ and deal with are saints do they not think they will have their own ends and be truer to themselves than to mem 
 therefore there is no better way to moderate suspicions than to account upon such suspicions as true and yet to bridle them as false for so far a man ought to make use of suspicions as to provide as if that should be true that he suspects yet it may do him no hurt suspicions that the mind of itself gamers are but buzzes but suspicions that are artificially nourished and put into heads by the tales and whisperings of others have stings 
 certainly the best mean to clear the way in this same wood of suspicions is frankly to communicate them with the party that he suspects for thereby he shall be sure to know more of the truth of them than he did before and withal shall make that party more circumspect not to give further cause of suspicion but this would not be done to men of base natures for they if they find themselves once suspected will never be true the italian says sospetto licentia fede as if suspicion did give a passport to faith but it ought rather to kindle it to discharge itself

 book the year 
 chapter iii 
 
 four and four 
 it is hard nowadays to picture to self what a of students and grisettes to the country was like years suburbs of paris are no longer the same the physiognomy of what may be called circumparisian life has changed completely in the last where there was the cuckoo there is the railway car where there was a there is now the steamboat people speak of fecamp nowadays as they spoke of in those paris of is a city which has france for its outskirts 
 the four couples conscientiously went through with all the country follies possible at that time 
 the vacation was beginning and it was a warm bright summer day 
 on the preceding day favourite the only one who knew how to write had written the following to tholomyes in the name of the four 
 it is a good hour to emerge from happiness 
 that is why they rose at five in the they went to by the coach looked at the dry cascade and exclaimed this must be very beautiful when there is breakfasted at the where castaing had not yet been they treated themselves to a game of under the quincunx of trees of the grand fountain they ascended diogenes lantern they gambled for macaroons at the roulette establishment of the pont de sevres picked bouquets at pateaux bought at neuilly ate apple tarts everywhere and were perfectly happy 
 the young girls rustled and chatted like warblers escaped from their cage 
 it was a perfect delirium 
 from time to time they bestowed little taps on the young men 
 matutinal intoxication of life adorable years the wings of the dragonfly quiver 
 oh whoever you may be do you not remember 
 have you rambled through the brushwood holding aside the branches on account of the charming head which is coming on behind you 
 have you slid laughing down a slope all wet with rain with a beloved woman holding your hand and crying ah my new boots what a state they are in 
 let us say at once that that merry obstacle a shower was lacking in the case of this party although favourite had said as they set out with a magisterial and maternal tone the slugs are crawling in the sign of rain children 
 all four were madly pretty 
 a good old classic poet then famous a good fellow who had an eleonore m le chevalier de labouisse as he strolled that day beneath the of saw them pass about ten in the morning and exclaimed there is one too many of them as he thought of the friend the one aged three and twenty the old one ran on in front under the great green boughs jumped the ditches stalked distractedly over bushes and presided over this with the spirit of a young female and dahlia whom chance had made beautiful in such a way that they set each off when they were together and completed each other never left each other more from an instinct of coquetry than from friendship and clinging to each other they assumed english poses the first keepsakes had just made their appearance melancholy was dawning for women as later on byronism dawned for men and the hair of the tender sex began to droop dolefully 
 zephine and dahlia had their hair dressed in rolls 
 listolier and fameuil who were engaged in discussing their professors explained to fantine the difference that existed between m delvincourt and m blondeau 
 blachevelle seemed to have been created expressly to carry imitation india shawl of manufacture on his arm on sundays 
 tholomyes followed dominating the group 
 he was very gay but one felt the force of government in him there was dictation in his joviality his principal ornament was a pair of trousers of pattern of nankeen with straps of braided copper wire he carried a stout rattan worth two hundred francs in his hand and as he treated himself to everything a strange thing called a cigar in his was sacred to him he smoked 
 that tholomyes is astounding said the others with trousers 
 what energy 
 as for fantine she was a joy to behold 
 her splendid teeth had evidently received an office from 
 she preferred to carry her little hat of sewed straw with its long white strings in her hand rather than on her head 
 her thick blond hair which was inclined to wave and which easily uncoiled and which it was necessary to fasten up incessantly seemed made for the flight of galatea under the willows 
 her rosy lips babbled corners of her mouth voluptuously turned up as in the antique masks of erigone had an air of encouraging the audacious but her long shadowy lashes drooped discreetly over the jollity of the lower part of the face as though to call a halt 
 there was something indescribably harmonious and striking about her entire wore a gown of mauve barege little reddish brown buskins whose ribbons traced an x on her fine white stockings and that sort of muslin spencer a marseilles invention whose name canezou a corruption of the words quinze aout pronounced after the fashion of the canebiere signifies fine weather heat and three others less timid as we have already said wore dresses without disguise which in summer beneath hats are very graceful and enticing but by the side of these audacious outfits blond canezou with its transparencies its indiscretion and its reticence concealing and displaying at one and the same time seemed an alluring godsend of decency and the famous court of love presided over by the vicomtesse de cette with the eyes would perhaps have awarded the prize for coquetry to this canezou in the contest for the prize of most ingenious is at times the wisest 
 this does happen 
 brilliant of face delicate of profile with eyes of a deep blue heavy lids feet arched and small wrists and ankles admirably formed a white skin which here and there allowed the azure branching of the veins to be seen joy a cheek that was young and fresh the robust throat of the juno of aegina a strong and supple nape of the neck shoulders modelled as though by coustou with a voluptuous dimple in the middle visible through the muslin a gayety cooled by dreaminess sculptural and was fantine and beneath these feminine adornments and these ribbons one could divine a statue and in that statue a soul 
 fantine was beautiful without being too conscious of rare dreamers mysterious priests of the beautiful who silently confront everything with perfection would have caught a glimpse in this little through the transparency of her parisian grace of the ancient sacred euphony 
 this daughter of the shadows was thoroughbred 
 she was beautiful in the two ways style and rhythm 
 style is the form of the ideal rhythm is its movement 
 we have said that fantine was joy she was also modesty 
 to an observer who studied her attentively that which breathed from her athwart all the intoxication of her age the season and her love affair was an invincible expression of reserve and remained a little astonished 
 this chaste astonishment is the shade of difference which separates psyche from had the long white fine fingers of the vestal virgin who stirs the ashes of the sacred fire with a golden pin 
 although she would have refused nothing to tholomyes as we shall have more than ample opportunity to see her face in repose was supremely virginal a sort of serious and almost austere dignity suddenly overwhelmed her at certain times and there was nothing more singular and disturbing than to see gayety become so suddenly extinct there and meditation succeed to cheerfulness without any transition sudden and sometimes severely accentuated gravity resembled the disdain of a goddess 
 her brow her nose her chin presented that equilibrium of outline which is quite distinct from equilibrium of proportion and from which harmony of countenance results in the very characteristic interval which separates the base of the nose from the upper lip she had that imperceptible and charming fold a mysterious sign of chastity which makes barberousse fall in love with a diana found in the treasures of iconia 
 love is a fault so be it 
 fantine was innocence floating high over fault

 return of the jedi 
 ii 
 
 han strained to see her though he had the eyes of a newborn leia where arewe 
 palace got to get you out of here quick 
 he sat up shakily a not going to be much help 
 she looked at him a long moment her blinded traveled find him risked her life lost time needed sorely by the rebellion timeshe really afford to throw away on personal quests and private desiresbutshe loved him 
 tears filled her eyes make it she whispered 
 impulsively she embraced him and kissed him again he too was floodedwith emotion all at from the dead the beautiful princess filling his him from the teeth of the void he felt overwhelmed unable to to speak he held her tightly his blind eyes closed fast against all the sordidrealities that would come rushing in soon enough 
 sooner than that as it happened a repulsive squishing sound suddenly becameall too obvious behind them han opened his eyes but could still see nothing leialooked up to the alcove beyond and her gaze turned to an expression of horror forthe curtain had been drawn away and the entire area floor to ceiling was composedof a gallery of the most disgusting miscreants of 
 hand shot up to her mouth 
 what is it han pressed her something obviously was terribly wrong hestared into his own blackness 
 an obscene cackle rose from the other side of the alcove a huttese cackle 
 han held his head closed his eyes again as if to keep away the inevitable for justone more moment i know that laugh 
 the curtain on the far side was suddenly drawn open there sat jabba ishi boba and several guards they all laughed kept laughing laughed to punish 
 my my what a touching sight jabba purred han my boy your taste incompanions has improved even if your luck has not 
 even blind solo could slide into smooth talk easier than a i was on my way back to pay you when i got a little now iknow had our differences but sure we can work this out 
 this time jabba genuinely chuckled too late for that solo you mayhave been the best smuggler in the business but now bantha fodder he cutshort his smile and gestured to his guards take him 
 guards grabbed leia and han they dragged the corellian pirate off whileleia continued struggling where she was 
 i will decide how to kill him later jabba muttered

 from the rank of guards lando quickly moved forward took hold of leia andattempted to lead her away 
 jabba stopped them wait bring her to me 
 lando and leia halted in lando looked tense uncertain what to quite time to move yet the odds still just right he knew he wasthe and an was something you had to know how toplay to win 
 be all right leia whispered 
 not so sure he replied but the moment was pasted there was nothingelse to be done now he and ishi tib the birdlizard dragged the young princess tojabba 
 threepio been watching everything from his place behind jabba couldwatch no more he turned away in dread 
 leia on the other hand stood tall before the loathsome monarch her anger ranhigh with all the galaxy by this petty scumdealer was more outrageous than shecould tolerate still she kept her voice calm for she was in the end a have powerful friends jabba you will soon regret this 
 sure sure the old gangster rumbled with glee but in the meantime iwill thoroughly enjoy the pleasure of your company 
 he pulled her eagerly to him until their faces were mere inches apart her bellypressed to his oily snake skin she thought about killing him outright then and she held her ire in check since the rest of these vermin might have killed herbefore she could escape with han better odds were sure to come later so sheswallowed hard and for the time being put up with this slimepot as best she could 
 threepio peeked out momentarily then immediately withdrew again oh watch 
 foul beast that he was jabba poked his fat dripping tongue out to the slopped a beastly kiss squarely on her mouth 
 han was thrown roughly into the dungeon cell the door crashed shut behind fell to the floor in the darkness then picked himself up and sat against the a few moments of pounding the ground with his fist he quieted down and triedto organize his thoughts 
 darkness well blast it blind is blind no use wishing for moondew on ameteorite only it was so frustrating coming out of like that saved bythe one person who 
 leia the star stomach dropped at the thought of what must behappening to her now if only he knew where he was tentatively he knocked onthe wall behind him solid rock 
 what could he do bargain maybe but what did he have to bargain question he did i ever have to have something before i couldbargain with it 
 what though money jabba had more than he could ever count could give jabba more pleasure than to defile the princess and kill solo were fact it look like they could get much worse 
 then he heard the growl a low formidable snarl from out of the denseblackness at the far corner of the cell the growl of a large and angry beast 
 the hair on arms stood on end quickly he rose his back to the like got company he muttered 
 the wild creature bellowed out an insane groawwwwr and raced straight atsolo grabbing him ferociously around the chest lifting him several feet into the off his breathing 
 han was totally motionless for several long believe hisears chewie is that you 
 the giant wookiee barked with joy 
 for the second time in an hour solo was overcome with happiness but this wasan entirely different matter all right all right wait a second crushing me 
 chewbacca put his friend down han reached up and scratched his chewie cooed like a pup 
 okay going on around here anyway han was instantly back on was unbelievably good was someone he could make a plan not only someone but his most loyal friend in the galaxy 
 chewie filled him in at length arh arhaghh shpahrgh rahr aurowwwrahrahgrop rahp rah 
 plan what is he doing here 
 chewie barked extensively 
 han shook his head is luke crazy you listen to him that even take care of himself let alone rescue anyone 
 rowr ahragh awf ahraroww rowh rohngr grgrff rf rf 
 a jedi knight come on out of it for a little while and everybody getsdelusions 
 chewbacca growled insistently 
 han nodded dubiously in the blackness believe it when i see it hecommented walking stoutly into the wall if excuse the expression 
 the iron main gate of palace scraped open harshly oiled only with sandand time standing outside in the dusty gale staring into the black cavernousentranceway was luke skywalker 
 he was clad in the robe of the jedi cassock bore neithergun nor lightsaber he stood loosely without bravado taking a measure of the placebefore entering he was a man now wiser like a more from loss thanfrom years loss of illusions loss of dependency loss of friends to war lossof sleep to stress loss of laughter loss of his hand 
 but of all his losses the greatest was that which came from knowledge and fromthe deep recognition that he could never what he knew so many things hewished never learned he had aged with the weight of this knowledge 
 knowledge brought benefits of course he was less impulsive had given him perspective a framework in which to fit the events of is a lattice of spatial and time coordinates spanning his existence backearliest memories ahead to a hundred alternative futures a lattice of depths andconundrums and interstices through which luke could peer at any new event in hislife peer at it with perspective a lattice of shadows and corners rolling back to thevanishing point on the horizon of mind and all these shadow boxes that lentsuch perspective to thingswell this lattice gave his life a certain darkness 
 nothing of substance of in any case some would have said thisshading gave a depth to his personality where before it had been thin such a suggestion probably would have come from jaded a jaded time nonetheless there was a certain darkness now 
 there were other advantages to knowledge rationality etiquette of them all was a true sword but it did have its advantages 
 furthermore he was skilled in the craft of the jedi now where before beenmerely precocious 
 he was more aware now 
 these were all desirable attributes to be sure and luke knew as well as anyonethat all things alive must grow still it carried a certain sadness the sum of all thisknowledge a certain sense of regret but who could afford to be a boy in timessuch as these 
 resolutely luke strode into the arching hallway 
 almost immediately two gamorreans stepped up blocking his path one spokein voice that did not invite debate no chuba 
 luke raised his hand and pointed at the guards before either could draw aweapon they were both clutching their own throats choking gasping they fell totheir knees 
 luke lowered his hand and walked on the guards suddenly able to breatheagain slumped to the steps they follow 
 around the next corner luke was met by bib fortuna fortuna began speakingas he approached the young jedi but luke never broke stride so bib had to reversehis direction in and hurry along with skywalker in order to carry onconversation 
 you must be the one called skywalker his excellency will not see you 
 i will speak to jabba now luke spoke evenly never slowing they passedseveral more guards at the next crossing who fell in behind them 
 the great jabba is asleep bib explained he has instructed me to tell youthere will be no bargains 
 luke stopped suddenly and stared at bib he locked eyes with the his hand slightly took a minutely inward turn you will take me to 
 bib paused tilted his head a fraction what were his instructions oh he remembered i will take you to jabba now 
 he turned and walked down the twisting corridor that led to the throne followed him into the gloom 
 you serve your master well he whispered in ear 
 i serve my master well bib nodded with conviction 
 you are sure to be rewarded luke added 
 bib smiled smugly i am sure to be rewarded 
 as luke and bib entered court the level of tumult dropped precipitouslyas if presence had a cooling effect everyone felt a change 
 the lieutenant and the jedi knight approached the throne luke saw leiaseated there now by belly she was chained at the neck and dressed in theskimpy costume of a dancing girl he could feel her pain immediately from acrossthe he said nothing even look at her shut her anguish completelyout of his mind for he needed to focus his attention entirely on jabba 
 leia for her part sensed this at once she closed her mind to luke to keepherself from distracting him yet at the same time she kept it open ready to receiveany sliver of information she might need to act she felt charged with possibilities 
 threepio peeked out from behind the throne as bib walked up for the firsttime in many days he scanned his hope program ah at last master to take me away from all this he beamed 
 bib stood proudly before jabba master i present luke skywalker jediknight 
 i told you not to admit him the growled in huttese 
 i must be allowed to speak luke spoke quietly though his words were heardthroughout the hall 
 he must be allowed to speak bob concurred thoughtfully 
 jabba furious bashed bib across the face and sent his reeling to the fool using an old jedi mind trick 
 luke let all the rest of the motley horde that surrounded him melt into therecesses of his consciousness to let jabba fill his mind totally you will bringcaptain solo and the wookiee to me 
 jabba smiled grimly your mind powers will not work on me boy i am notaffected by your human thought pattern then as an afterthought i was killingyour kind when being a jedi meant something 
 luke altered his stance somewhat internally and externally nevertheless iam taking captain solo and his friends you can either profit from thisor bedestroyed your choice but i warn you not to underestimate my powers hespoke in his own language which jabba well understood 
 jabba laughed the laugh of a lion cautioned by a mouse 
 threepio who had been observing this interplay intently leaned forward towhisper to luke master standing a guard abruptly restrained theconcerned droid though and pulled him back to his place 
 jabba cut short his laugh with a scowl there will be no bargain young shall enjoy watching you die 
 luke raised his hand a pistol jumped out of the holster of a nearby guard andlanded snugly in the palm luke pointed the weapon at jabba 
 jabba spat boscka 
 the floor suddenly dropped away sending luke and his guard crashing into thepit below the trap door immediately closed again all the beasts of the courtrushed to the and looked down 
 luke yelled leia she felt part of her self torn away pulled down into thepit with him she started forward but was held in check by the manacle around herthroat raucous laughter crowded in from everywhere at once set her on poised to flee 
 a human guard touched her shoulder she looked it was he shook his head no imperceptibly her muscles relaxed the right moment he it was the right hand all the cards werehere han leia chewbaccaand old wild card lando he just leia revealing the hand before all the bets were out the stakes were just toohigh 
 in the pit below luke picked himself up off the floor he found he was now ina large cavelike dungeon the walls formed of craggy boulders pocked with lightlesscrevices the bones of countless animals were strewn over the of decayed flesh and twisted fear 
 feet above him in the ceiling he saw the iron grating through repugnant courtiers peered 
 the guard beside him suddenly began to scream uncontrollably as a door in theside of the cave slowly rumbled open with infinite calm luke surveyed hissurroundings as he removed his long robe down to his jedi tunic to give him morefreedom of movement he backed quickly to the wall and crouched there watching 
 out of the side passage emerged the giant rancor the size of an elephant itwas somehow reptilian somehow as unformed as a nightmare its huge screechingmouth was asymmetrical in its head its fangs and claws set all out of proportion itwas clearly a mutant and wild as all unreason 
 the guard picked up the pistol from the dirt where it had fallen and began firinglaser bursts at the hideous monster this only made the beast angrier it lumberedtoward the guard 
 the guard kept firing ignoring the laser blasts the beast grabbed the hystericalguard popped him into its slavering jaws and swallowed him in a gulp theaudience above cheered laughed and threw coins 
 the monster then turned and started for luke but the jedi knight leaped eightmeters straight up and grabbed onto the overhead grate the crowd began to over hand luke traversed the grating toward the corner of the cave strugglingto maintain his grip as the audience jeered his efforts one hand slipped on the oilygrid and he dangled precariously over the baying mutant 
 two jawas ran across the top of the grate they mashed fingers withtheir rifle butts once again the crowd roared its approval 
 the rancor pawed at luke from below but the jedi dangled just out of luke released his hold and dropped directly onto the eye of the howlingmonster he then tumbled to the floor 
 the rancor screamed in pain and stumbled swatting its own face to knock awaythe agony it ran in circles a few times then spotted luke again and came at stooped down to pick up the long bone of an earlier victim he brandished itbefore him the gallery above thought this was hilarious and hooted in delight 
 the monster grabbed luke and brought him up to its salivating mouth at thelast moment though luke wedged the bone deep in the mouth and jumpedto the floor as the beast began to gag the rancor bellowed and flailed headlong into a wall several rocks were dislodged starting an avalanchethat nearly buried luke as he crouched deep in a crevice near the floor the crowdclapped in unison 
 luke tried to clear his mind fear is a great cloud ben used to tell him itmakes the cold colder and the dark darker but let it rise and it will dissolve soluke let it rise past the clamor of the beast above him and examined ways he mightturn the sad rantings on itself 
 it was not an evil beast that much was clear had it been purely malicious itswickedness could easily have been turned on pure evil ben had said wasalways in the end but this monster dumb andmistreated hungry and in pain it lashed out at whatever came near for luke tohave looked on that as evil would only have been a projection of own would have been false and it certainly have helped him out ofthis situation 
 no he was going to have to keep his mind was just outwitthe savage brute to put it out of its misery 
 most preferable would have been to set it loose in court but that seemedunlikely he considered next giving the creature the means to do itself endits own pain unfortunately the creature was far too angered to comprehend thesolace of the void luke finally began studying the specific contours of the cave totry to come up with a specific plan 
 the rancor meanwhile had knocked the bone from its mouth and enraged wasscrabbling through the rubble of fallen rocks searching for luke luke though hisvision was partially obscured by the pile that still sheltered him could see now pastthe monster to a holding cave beyond that to a utility door if only hecould get to it 
 the rancor knocked away a boulder and spotted luke recoiling in the it reached in to pluck the boy out luke grabbed a large rock andsmashed it down on the finger as hard as he could as the rancor in pain once more luke ran for the holding cave 
 he reached the doorway and ran in before him a heavy barred gate blockedthe way beyond this gate the two keepers sat eating dinner they lookedup as luke entered then stood and walked toward the gate 
 luke turned around to see the monster coming angrily after him he turnedback to the gate and tried to open it the keepers poked at him with spears jabbed at him through the bars laughing and chewing their the rancor drew closer to the young jedi 
 luke backed against the side wall as the rancor reached in the room for he saw the control panel halfway up the opposite rancor began to enter the holding room closing for the kill when all at onceluke picked up a skull off the floor and hurled it at the panel 
 the panel exploded in a shower of sparks and the giant iron overhead restrainingdoor came crashing down on the head crushing it like an axe smashingthrough a ripe watermelon 
 those in the audience above gasped as one then were silent they were alltruly stunned at this bizarre turn of events they all looked to jabba who wasapoplectic with rage never had he felt such fury leia tried to hide her was unable to keep from smiling and this increased anger even he snapped at his guards get him out of there bring me solo and thewookiee they will all suffer for this outrage 
 in the pit below luke stood calmly as several of henchmen ran him in bonds and ushered him out 
 the rancor keeper wept openly and threw himself down on the body of his deadpet life would be a lonely proposition for him from that day 
 han and chewie were led before the steaming jabba han still squinted andstumbled every few feet threepio stood behind the hutt unbearable kept leia on a short tether stroking her hair to try to calm himself a constantmurmuring filled the room as the rabble speculated on what was going to happen towhom 
 with a flurry several lando luke inacross the room to give them passage the courtiers parted like an unruly luke too was standing before the throne he nudged solo with a to see you again old buddy 
 face lit up there seemed to be no end to the number of friends he keptbumping into luke are you in this mess now too 
 miss it skywalker smiled for just a moment he almost felt like aboy again 
 well how we doing han raised his eyebrows 
 same as always said luke 
 solo replied under his breath he felt one hundred percent like old a second later a bleak thought chilled him 
 leia is she 
 her eyes had been fixed on him from the moment entered the his spirit with her own when he spoke of her now sheresponded instantly calling from her place on throne all right but know how much longer i can hold off your slobbering friend here she wasintentionally cavalier to put solo at ease besides the sight of all her friends thereat once made her feel nearly invincible han luke chewie threepiowas skulking around somewhere trying to be forgotten leia almost laughed outloud almost punched jabba in the nose she could barely restrain herself shewanted to hug them all 
 suddenly jabba shouted the entire room was immediately silent talkdroid 
 timidly threepio stepped forward and with an embarrassed headgesture addressed the captives his high exaltedness the great jabba the hutt hasdecreed that you are to be terminated immediately 
 solo said loudly good i hate long waits 
 your extreme offense against his majesty threepio went on demands themost torturous form of death 
 no sense in doing things halfway solo cracked jabba could be so and now with old goldenrod there making his pronouncements 
 no matter what else threepio simply hated being interrupted he collectedhimself nonetheless and continued you will be taken to the dune sea where youwill be thrown into the great pit of carkoon 
 han shrugged then turned to luke that sound too bad 
 threepio ignored the interruption the resting place of the in his belly you will find a new definition of pain and suffering as youslowly digest for a thousand years 
 on second thought we could pass on that solo reconsidered a thousandyears was a bit much 
 chewie barked his agreement 
 luke only smiled you should have bargained jabba this is the lastmistake ever make luke was unable to suppress the satisfaction in his found jabba leech of the galaxy sucking the life from whatever hetouched luke wanted to burn the villain and so was actually rather glad jabba hadrefused to now luke would get his wish precisely of course hisprimary objective was to free his friends whom he loved dearly it was this concernthat guided him now above all else but in the process to free the universe of thisgangster was a prospect that tinted purpose with an satisfaction 
 jabba chortled evilly take them away at last a bit of pure pleasure on anotherwise dreary the sarlacc was the only thing he enjoyed as much asfeeding the rancor poor rancor 
 a loud cheer rose from the crowd as the prisoners were carried off leia lookedafter them with great concern but when she caught a glimpse of face she wasstirred to see it still fixed in a broad genuine smile she sighed deeply to expel herdoubts 
 giant antigravity sail barge glided slowly over the endless dune iron hull creaked in the slight breeze each puff of wind coughing intothe two huge sails as if even nature suffered some terminal malaise wherever it camenear jabba he was belowdecks now with most of his court hiding the decay of hisspirit from the cleansing sun 
 alongside the barge two small skiffs floated in an escort six scruffy soldiers the other a gun skiff containing the prisoners luke they were all in bonds and surrounded by armed weequays and lando calrissian 
 barada was the sort and not likely to let anything get out of carried a as if he wanted nothing more than to hear it speak 
 the weequays were an odd sort they were brothers leathery and bald savefor a tribal braided and worn to the side no one was certain whetherweequay was the name of their tribe or their species or whether all in their tribewere brothers or all were named weequays it was known only that these two werecalled by this name and that they treated all other creatures indifferently with eachother they were gentle even tender but like barada they seemed anxious for theprisoners to misbehave 
 and lando of course remained silent for an opportunity thisreminded him of the lithium scam run on pesmenben salted thedunes there with lithium carbonate to con this imperial governor into leasing theplanet lando posing as a nonunion mine guard had made the governor lie facedown in the bottom of the boat and throw his bribe overboard when the unionofficials raided them gotten away on that one lando expectedthis job would go much the same except they might have to throw the guardsoverboard as well 
 han kept his ear tuned for his eyes were still useless he spoke with recklessdisregard to put the guards at get them used to his talking and moving sowhen the time came for him really to move be a critical fraction behind hismark and of spoke just to hear himself speak 
 i think my sight is getting better he said squinting over the sand instead ofbig dark blur i see a big bright blur 
 believe me not missing anything luke smiled i grew up here 
 luke thought of his youth on tatooine living on his farm cruising in landspeeder with his few of other settlers sitting their ownlonely outposts nothing ever to do here really for man or boy but cruise themonotonous dunes and try to avoid the peevish tusken raiders who guarded the sandas if it were luke knew this place 
 met kenobi ben kenobi the hermit lived in thewilderness since nobody knew when the man first shown luke the way ofthe jedi 
 luke thought of him now with great love and great sorrow for ben was morethan anyone the agent of discoveries and discoveries of losses 
 ben had taken luke to mos eisley the pirate city on the western face of the cantina where first met han solo and chewbacca the wookiee takenhim there after imperial stormtroopers had murdered uncle owen and aunt for the fugitive droids artoo and threepio 
 how it had all started for luke here on tatooine like a recurring dreamhe knew this place and he had sworn then that he would never return 
 i grew up here he repeated softly 
 and now going die here solo replied 
 i planning on it luke shook himself out of his reverie 
 if this is your big plan so far not crazy about it 
 palace was too well guarded i had to get you out of there just stayclose to chewie and lando take care of everything 
 i can hardly wait solo had a sinking feeling this grand escape depended thinking he was a questionable premise at best considering it was anextinct brotherhood that had used a force he really believe in anyway a fastship and a good blaster are what han believed in and he wished he had them now 
 jabba sat in the main cabin of the sail barge surrounded by his entire party at the palace was simply continuing in result being a slightlywobblier brand of in the nature of a prelynching celebration soblood lust and belligerence were testing new levels 
 threepio was way out of his depth at the moment he was being forced totranslate an argument between ephant mon and concerning a point ofquark warfare that was marginally beyond him ephant mon a bulky uprightpachydermoid with an ugly betusked snout was taking to way ofthinking an untenable position however on his shoulder sat salacious crumb theinsane little reptilian monkey who had the habit of repeating verbatim everythingephant said thereby effectively doubling the weight of argument 
 ephant concluded the oration with a typically bellicose avowal woossiejawamba boog 
 threepio really want to translate this to the was already dunk as a spicer but he did 
 all three eyes dilated in fury backawa backawa without furtherpreamble he punched ephant mon in the snout sending him flying into a school ofsquid heads 
 felt this response needed no translation and took the opportunity toslip to he promptly bumped into a small droid serving drinks thedrinks spilled everywhere 
 the stubby little droid let out a fluent series of irate beeps toots to threepio instantly he looked down in utter what are you doing here 
 doooweep chwhrrrrree bedzhng 
 i can see serving drinks but this place is dangerous goingto execute master luke and if not careful us too 
 artoo bit nonchalantly as far as threepio was concerned i wishi had your confidence he replied glumly 
 jabba chuckled to see ephant mon go loved a good beating heespecially loved to see strength crumble to see the proud fall 
 he tugged with his swollen fingers on the chain attached to princess the more resistance he met with the more he drawn thestruggling princess close to him once more 
 stay too far my lovely soon you will begin to appreciate me hepulled her very near and forced her to drink from his glass 
 leia opened her mouth and she closed her mind it was disgusting of there were worse things and in any case this last 
 the worse things she knew well her standard of comparison was the been tortured by darth vader she had almost broken the dark lord neverknew how close come to extracting the information he wanted from her thelocation of the rebel base he had captured her just after managed to sendartoo and threepio for her taken her to the death star injected herwith chemicalsand tortured her 
 tortured her body first with his efficient needles pressure electrojabbers endured these pains as she now endured a natural inner strength 
 she slid a few feet away from jabba now as his attention to peer out the slats in the louvered windows to squint through thedusty sunlight at the skiff on which her rescuers were being carried 
 it was stopping 
 the whole convoy was stopping in fact over a huge sand pit the sail bargemoved to one side of the giant depression with the escort skiff the skiffhovered directly over the pit though perhaps twenty feet in the air 
 at the bottom of the deep cone of sand a repulsive hole puckered almost unmoving the hole was eight feet in perimeter clustered with three rows of teeth sandstuck to the mucus that lined the sides of the opening occasionally sliding into theblack cavity at the center 
 this was the mouth of the sarlacc 
 an iron plank was extended over the side of the prisoners skiff two guardsuntied bonds and shoved him gruffly out onto the plank straight above theorifice in the sand now beginning to undulate in peristaltic movement and salivatewith increased mucus secretion as it smelled the meat it was about to receive 
 jabba moved his party up to the observation deck 
 luke rubbed his wrists to restore circulation the heat shimmering off thedesert warmed his finally this would always be his home born and bredin a bantha patch he saw leia standing at the rail of the big barge and winked back 
 jabba motioned threepio to his side then mumbled orders to the golden stepped up to the comlink jabba raised his arm and the whole motleyarray of intergalactic pirated fell silent voice arose amplified by theloudspeaker 
 his excellency hopes you will die honorably threepio announced mislaid thecorrect program nonetheless he was a droid his functions well only no free will please he shook his head and continued butshould any of you wish to beg for mercy jabba will now listen to your pleas 
 han stepped forward to give the bloated slime pot his last thoughts in case allelse failed you tell that slimy piece of filth 
 unfortunately han was facing into the desert away from the sail reached over and turned solo around so he was now properly facing thepiece of filth he was addressing 
 han nodded without stopping filth get no such pleasurefrom us 
 chewie made a few growly noises of general agreement 
 luke was ready jabba this is your last chance he shouted free us ordie he shot a quick look to lando who moved unobtrusively toward the back ofthe skiff this was it lando just toss the guards overboard and takeoff under nose 
 the monsters on the barge roared with laughter artoo during this silently up the ramp to the side of upper deck 
 jabba raised his hand and his minions were quiet sure right myyoung jedi friend he smiled then he turned his thumb down put him in 
 the spectators cheered as luke was prodded to the edge of the plank byweequay luke looked up at artoo standing alone by the rail and flipped the littledroid a jaunty salute at that prearranged signal a flap slid open in domedhead and a projectile shot high into the air and curved in a gentle arc over the desert 
 luke jumped off the plank another bloodthirsty cheer went up in less than asecond though luke had spun around in freefall caught the end of the plank with hisfingertips the thin metal bent wildly from his weight paused near to catapulted him up in he did a complete flip and dropped down in themiddle of the spot just left only now behind the confused he extended his arm to his side palm suddenly his artoo had shot sailing toward him dropped neatly into his open hand 
 with jedi speed luke ignited his sword and attacked the guard at the the plank sending him screaming overboard into the twitching mouth of thesarlacc 
 the other guards swarmed toward luke grimly he waded into flashing 
 his own his he had lost his in the duel withdarth vader in which lost his hand as well darth vader who had told luke hewas his father 
 but this lightsaber luke had fashioned himself in abandonedhut on the other side of with the old master tools and with love and craft and dire need he wielded it now as if it were fused to hishand as if it were an extension of his own arm this lightsaber truly was 
 he cut through the onslaught like a light dissolving shadow 
 lando grappled with the helmsman trying to seize the controls of the laser pistol fired blasting the nearby panel and the skiff lurched tothe side throwing another guard into the pit knocking everyone else into a pile on thedeck luke picked himself up and ran toward the helmsman lightsaber raised thecreature retreated at the overpowering sight stumbledand he too went over theedge into the maw 
 the bewildered guard landed in the soft sandy slope of the pit and began aninexorable slide down toward the toothy viscous opening he clawed desperately atthe sand screaming suddenly a muscled tentacle oozed out of the up the caked sand coiled tightly around the ankle and pulledhim into the hole with a grotesques slurp 
 all this happened in a matter of seconds when he saw what was exploded in a rage and yelled furious commands at those around him in amoment there was general uproar with creatures running through every door itwas during this directionless confusion that leia acted 
 she jumped onto throne grabbed the chain which enslaved her andwrapped it around his bulbous throat then she dove off the other side of thesupport pulling the chain violently in her grasp the small metal rings buriedthemselves in the loose folds of the neck like a garrote 
 with a strength beyond her own strength she pulled he bucked with his hugetorso nearly breaking her fingers nearly yanking her arms from their sockets hecould get no leverage his bulk was too unwieldy but just his sheer mass wasalmost enough to break any mere physical restraint 
 yet hold was not merely physical she closed of her eyes closed out thepain in her hands focused all of her all it was able to the breath from the horrid creature 
 she pulled she sweated she visualized the chain digging millimeter bymillimeter deeper into jabba wildly thrashed frantically twistedfrom this least expected of foes 
 with a last gasping effort jabba tensed every muscle and lurched forward hisreptilian eyes began to bulge from their sockets as the chain tightened his oily tongueflopped from his mouth his thick tail twitched in spasms of effort until he finallylay 
 leia sat about trying to free herself from the chain at her neck while outside thebattle began to rage 
 boba fett ignited his rocket pack leaped into the air and with a single effortflew down from the barge to the skiff just as luke finished freeing han and chewiefrom their bonds boba aimed his laser gun at luke but before he could fire theyoung jedi spun around sweeping his lightsword in an arc that sliced the gun in half 
 a series of blasts suddenly erupted from the large cannon on the upper deck ofthe barge hitting the skiff broadside and rocking it forty degrees askew landograbbed a broken strut and dangled desperately above the sarlacc thisdevelopment was definitely not in his game plan and he vowed to himself neveragain to get involved in a con that he run from start to finish 
 the skiff took another direct hit from the deck gun throwing chewie andhan against the rail wounded the wookiee howled in pain luke looked over athis hairy friend whereupon boba fett taking advantage of that moment of a cable from out of his armored sleeve 
 the cable wrapped itself several times around luke pinning his arms to his sword arm now free only from the wrist down he bent his wrist so thelightsaber pointed straight upand then spun toward boba along the cable in amoment the lightsaber touched the end of the wire lasso cutting through it shrugged the cable away just as another blast hit the skiff knocking bobaunconscious to the deck unfortunately this explosion also dislodged the strut fromwhich lando was hanging sending him careening into the sarlacc pit luke wasshaken by the explosion but unhurt lando hit the sandy slope shouted for tried to scramble out the loose sand only tumbled him deeper toward thegaping hole lando closed his eyes and tried to think of all the ways he might givethe sarlacc a thousand years of indigestion he bet himself three to two he couldoutlast anybody else in the stomach maybe if he talked that last guard outof his uniform 
 move luke screamed but his attention was immediately diverted by theincoming second skiff full of guards firing their weapons 
 it was a jedi but it took the soldiers in the second skiff by outnumbered attack this drives the force of the enemy in toward jumped directly into the center of the skiff and immediately began decimatingthem in their midst with lightning sweeps of his lightsaber 
 back in the other boat chewie tried to untangle to his feet chewie barked athim trying to direct him toward a spear lying loose on the deck 
 lando screamed starting to slide closer to the glistening jaws he was agambling man but he have taken long odds on his chances of escape rightnow 
 move lando han called out coming then to is it chewie he swung his hands frantically over the deck as chewiegrowled directions guiding movements at last han locked onto the spear 
 boba fett stumbled up just then still a little dizzy from the exploding shell helooked over at the other skiff where luke was in a pitched battle with six one hand boba steadied himself on the rail with the other he aimed his weaponat luke 
 chewie barked at han 
 which way shouted solo chewie barked 
 the blinded space pirate swung his long spear in direction blocked the blow with his forearm again he aimed at luke get out of myway you blind fool he cursed solo 
 chewie barked frantically han swung his spear again this time in the oppositedirection landing the hit squarely in the middle of rocket pack 
 the impact caused the rocket to ignite boba blasted off unexpectedly shootingover the second skiff like a missile and ricocheting straight down into the pit hisarmored body slid quickly past lando and rolled without pause into the 
 rrgrrowrrbroo fro bo chewie growled 
 he did solo smiled i wish i could have seen that 
 a major hit from the barge deck gun flipped the skiff on its side sending hanand almost everything else overboard his foot caught on the railing him swinging precariously above the sarlacc the wounded wookieetenaciously held on to the twisted debris astern 
 luke finished going through his adversaries on the second skiff assessed theproblem quickly and leaped across the chasm of sand to the sheer metal side of thehuge barge slowly he began a climb up the hull toward the deckgun 
 meanwhile on the observation deck leia had been intermittently struggling tobreak the chain which bound her to the dead gangster and hiding behind his massivecarcass whenever some guard ran by she stretched her full length now trying toretrieve a discarded laser no avail fortunately artoo at last came to herrescue after having first lost his bearings and rolled down the wrong plank 
 he zipped up to her finally extended a cutting appendage from the side of hiscasing and sliced through her bonds 
 thanks artoo good work now get out of here 
 they raced for the door on the way they passed threepio lying on the as a giant tuberous hulk named hermi odle sat on him salaciouscrumb the reptilian crouched by head picking out thegolden right eye 
 no no not my eyes threepio screamed 
 artoo sent a bolt of charge into hermi backside sending him wailingthrough a window a similar flash blasted salacious to the ceiling from which come down threepio quickly rose his eye dangling from a sheaf of he and artoo hurriedly followed leia out the back door 
 the deck gun blasted the tilting skiff once more shaking out virtually everythingthat remained inside except chewbacca desperately holding on with his injuredarm he was stretching over the rail grasping the ankle of the dangling solo who turn sightlessly reaching down for the terrified calrissian lando had managed tostop his slippage by lying very still now every time he reached up for arm the loose sand slid him a fraction closer to the hungry hole hesure hoped solo still holding that silly business back on bespin against him 
 chewie barked another direction at han 
 yeah i know i can see a lot better must be all the blood rushing to myhead 
 great lando called up now could you just grow a few inches taller 
 the deck gunners on the barge were lining up this human chain in their sights forthe coup de grace when luke stepped in front of them laughing like a pirate lit his lightsaber before they could squeeze off a shot a moment later they weresmoking corpses 
 a company of guards suddenly rushed up the steps from the lower decks of the blasts shot lightsaber from his hand he ran down the deck butwas quickly surrounded two of the soldiers manned the deck gun again lukelooked at his hand the mechanism was complex that replaced his real hand which vader had cut off in their lastencounter 
 he flexed the mechanism it still worked 
 the deck gunners fired at the skiff below it hit to the side of the small shock wave almost knocked chewie loose but in tipping the boat further hanwas able to grab onto wrist 
 pull solo yelled at the wookiee 
 caught screamed calrissian he looked down in panic to see one of tentacles slowly wrap around his ankle talk about a wild keptchanging the rules every five minutes in this game tentacles what kind of oddswas anybody gonna give on tentacles very long he decided with a fatalistic and sticky 
 the deck gunners realigned their sights for the final kill but it was all over forthem before they could had commandeered the second deck gun at theother end of the ship with her first shot she blasted the rigging that stood betweenthe two deck guns with her second shot she wiped out the first deck gun 
 the explosions rocked the great barge momentarily distracting the five guardswho surrounded luke in that moment he reached out his hand and the on the deck ten feet away flew into it he leaped straight up as two guardsfired at laser bolts killed each other he ignited his blade in the air it as he came down mortally wounded the others 
 he yelled to leia across the deck point it down 
 she tilted the second deck gun into the deck and nodded to threepio at the rail 
 artoo beside him beeped wildly 
 i artoo threepio cried too far to jumpaaahhh 
 artoo butted the golden droid over the edge and then stepped off head over toward the sand 
 meanwhile the was continuing between the sarlacc and solo withbaron calrissian as the rope and the prize chewbacca held leg bracedhimself on the rail and succeeded in pulling a laser pistol out of the wreckage withhis other hand he aimed the gun toward lando then lowered it barking hisconcern 
 right lando called out too far 
 chewbacca gave it to him he took it with one hand still holding on to landowith the other 
 now wait a second pal lando protested i thought you were blind 
 better trust me solo assured him 
 do i have a choice hey a little higher please he lowered his head 
 han squintedpulled the triggerand scored a direct hit on the tentacle thewormy thing instantly released its grip slithering back into its own mouth 
 chewbacca pulled mightily drawing first solo back into the thenlando 
 luke meantime gathered leia up in his left arm with his right he grabbed ahold of a rope from the rigging of the half mast and with his foot kickedthe trigger of the second deck jumped into the air as the cannon explodedinto the deck 
 the two of them swung on the swaying rope all the way down to the escort skiff once there luke steered it over to the prison he helped chewbacca han and lando on board 
 the sail barge continued exploding behind them half of it was now on fire 
 luke guided the skiff around beside the barge where legs couldbe seen sticking straight up out of the sand beside them periscopewas the only part of his anatomy visible above the dune the skiff stopped justabove them and lowered a large electromagnet from its compartment in the with a loud clang the two droids shot out of the sand and locked to plate 
 ow groaned threepio 
 beeedoo dweet artoo agreed 
 in a few minutes they were all in the skiff together more or less in one for the first time they looked at one another and realized they were all in the skifftogether more or less in one piece there was a great long moment of crying and beeping then someone accidentally squeezed arm and he bellowed and then they all ran about securing the the perimeters looking for sailing away 
 the great sail barge settled slowly in a chain of explosions and violent the little skiff flew quietly off across the finally in abrilliant conflagration that was only partially diminished by the scorching afternoonlight of twin suns

 book two 
 chapter iii 
 
 on returning from the review kutuzov took the austrian general into his private room and calling his adjutant asked for some papers relating to the condition of the troops on their arrival and the letters that had come from the archduke ferdinand who was in command of the advanced army prince andrew bolkonski came into the room with the required papers kutuzov and the austrian member of the hofkriegsrath were sitting at the table on which a plan was spread out 
 ah said kutuzov glancing at bolkonski as if by this exclamation he was asking the adjutant to wait and he went on with the conversation in french 
 all i can say general said he with a pleasant elegance of expression and intonation that obliged one to listen to each deliberately spoken word it was evident that kutuzov himself listened with pleasure to his own voice all i can say general is that if the matter depended on my personal wishes the will of his majesty the emperor francis would have been fulfilled long ago i should long ago have joined the archduke and believe me on my honour that to me personally it would be a pleasure to hand over the supreme command of the army into the hands of a better informed and more skillful general of whom austria has so many and to lay down all this heavy responsibility but circumstances are sometimes too strong for us general 
 and kutuzov smiled in a way that seemed to say you are quite at liberty not to believe me and i even care whether you do or not but you have no grounds for telling me so and that is the whole point 
 the austrian general looked dissatisfied but had no option but to reply in the same tone 
 on the contrary he said in a querulous and angry tone that contrasted with his flattering words on the contrary your participation in the common action is highly valued by his majesty but we think the present delay is depriving the splendid russian troops and their commander of the laurels they have been accustomed to win in their battles he concluded his evidently prearranged sentence 
 kutuzov bowed with the same smile 
 but that is my conviction and judging by the last letter with which his highness the archduke ferdinand has honored me i imagine that the austrian troops under the direction of so skillful a leader as general mack have by now already gained a decisive victory and no longer need our aid said kutuzov 
 the general frowned though there was no definite news of an austrian defeat there were many circumstances confirming the unfavorable rumors that were afloat and so suggestion of an austrian victory sounded much like irony but kutuzov went on blandly smiling with the same expression which seemed to say that he had a right to suppose so and in fact the last letter he had received from army informed him of a victory and stated strategically the position of the army was very favorable 
 give me that letter said kutuzov turning to prince andrew please have a look at it and kutuzov with an ironical smile about the corners of his mouth read to the austrian general the following passage in german from the archduke letter 
 we have fully concentrated forces of nearly seventy thousand men with which to attack and defeat the enemy should he cross the lech also as we are masters of ulm we cannot be deprived of the advantage of commanding both sides of the danube so that should the enemy not cross the lech we can cross the danube throw ourselves on his line of communications recross the river lower down and frustrate his intention should he try to direct his whole force against our faithful ally we shall therefore confidently await the moment when the imperial russian army will be fully equipped and shall then in conjunction with it easily find a way to prepare for the enemy the fate he deserves 
 kutuzov sighed deeply on finishing this paragraph and looked at the member of the hofkriegsrath mildly and attentively 
 but you know the wise maxim your excellency advising one to expect the worst said the austrian general evidently wishing to have done with jests and to come to business he involuntarily looked round at the 
 excuse me general interrupted kutuzov also turning to prince andrew look here my dear fellow get from kozlovski all the reports from our scouts here are two letters from count nostitz and here is one from his highness the archduke ferdinand and here are these he said handing him several papers make a neat memorandum in french out of all this showing all the news we have had of the movements of the austrian army and then give it to his excellency 
 prince andrew bowed his head in token of having understood from the first not only what had been said but also what kutuzov would have liked to tell him he gathered up the papers and with a bow to both stepped softly over the carpet and went out into the waiting room 
 though not much time had passed since prince andrew had left russia he had changed greatly during that period in the expression of his face in his movements in his walk scarcely a trace was left of his former affected languor and indolence he now looked like a man who has time to think of the impression he makes on others but is occupied with agreeable and interesting work his face expressed more satisfaction with himself and those around him his smile and glance were brighter and more attractive 
 kutuzov whom he had overtaken in poland had received him very kindly promised not to forget him distinguished him above the other adjutants and had taken him to vienna and given him the more serious commissions from vienna kutuzov wrote to his old comrade prince father 
 your son bids fair to become an officer distinguished by his industry firmness and expedition i consider myself fortunate to have such a subordinate by me 
 on staff among his fellow officers and in the army generally prince andrew had as he had had in petersburg society two quite opposite reputations some a minority acknowledged him to be different from themselves and from everyone else expected great things of him listened to him admired and imitated him and with them prince andrew was natural and pleasant others the majority disliked him and considered him conceited cold and disagreeable but among these people prince andrew knew how to take his stand so that they respected and even feared him 
 coming out of room into the waiting room with the papers in his hand prince andrew came up to his comrade the on duty kozlovski who was sitting at the window with a book 
 well prince asked kozlovski 
 i am ordered to write a memorandum explaining why we are not advancing 
 and why is it 
 prince andrew shrugged his shoulders 
 any news from mack 
 no 
 if it were true that he has been beaten news would have come 
 probably said prince andrew moving toward the outer door 
 but at that instant a tall austrian general in a greatcoat with the order of maria theresa on his neck and a black bandage round his head who had evidently just arrived entered quickly slamming the door prince andrew stopped short 
 commander in chief kutuzov said the newly arrived general speaking quickly with a harsh german accent looking to both sides and advancing straight toward the inner door 
 the commander in chief is engaged said kozlovski going hurriedly up to the unknown general and blocking his way to the door whom shall i announce 
 the unknown general looked disdainfully down at kozlovski who was rather short as if surprised that anyone should not know him 
 the commander in chief is engaged repeated kozlovski calmly 
 the face clouded his lips quivered and trembled he took out a notebook hurriedly scribbled something in pencil tore out the leaf gave it to kozlovski stepped quickly to the window and threw himself into a chair gazing at those in the room as if asking why do they look at me then he lifted his head stretched his neck as if he intended to say something but immediately with affected indifference began to hum to himself producing a queer sound which immediately broke off the door of the private room opened and kutuzov appeared in the doorway the general with the bandaged head bent forward as though running away from some danger and making long quick strides with his thin legs went up to kutuzov 
 vous voyez le malheureux mack he uttered in a broken voice 
 face as he stood in the open doorway remained perfectly immobile for a few moments then wrinkles ran over his face like a wave and his forehead became smooth again he bowed his head respectfully closed his eyes silently let mack enter his room before him and closed the door himself behind him 
 the report which had been circulated that the austrians had been beaten and that the whole army had surrendered at ulm proved to be correct within half an hour adjutants had been sent in various directions with orders which showed that the russian troops who had hitherto been inactive would also soon have to meet the enemy 
 prince andrew was one of those rare staff officers whose chief interest lay in the general progress of the war when he saw mack and heard the details of his disaster he understood that half the campaign was lost understood all the difficulties of the russian position and vividly imagined what awaited it and the part he would have to play involuntarily he felt a joyful agitation at the thought of the humiliation of arrogant austria and that in a time he might perhaps see and take part in the first russian encounter with the french since suvorov met them he feared that genius might outweigh all the courage of the russian troops and at the same time could not admit the idea of his hero being disgraced 
 excited and irritated by these thoughts prince andrew went toward his room to write to his father to whom he wrote every day in the corridor he met nesvitski with whom he shared a room and the wag zherkov they were as usual laughing 
 why are you so glum asked nesvitski noticing prince pale face and glittering eyes 
 nothing to be gay about answered bolkonski 
 just as prince andrew met nesvitski and zherkov there came toward them from the other end of the corridor strauch an austrian general who on staff in charge of the provisioning of the russian army and the member of the hofkriegsrath who had arrived the previous evening there was room enough in the wide corridor for the generals to pass the three officers quite easily but zherkov pushing nesvitski aside with his arm said in a breathless voice 
 coming coming stand aside make way please make way 
 the generals were passing by looking as if they wished to avoid embarrassing attentions on the face of the wag zherkov there suddenly appeared a stupid smile of glee which he seemed unable to suppress 
 your excellency said he in german stepping forward and addressing the austrian general i have the honor to congratulate you 
 he bowed his head and scraped first with one foot and then with the other awkwardly like a child at a dancing lesson 
 the member of the hofkriegsrath looked at him severely but seeing the seriousness of his stupid smile could not but give him a attention he screwed up his eyes showing that he was listening 
 i have the honor to congratulate you general mack has arrived quite well only a little bruised just here he added pointing with a beaming smile to his head 
 the general frowned turned away and went on 
 gott wie naiv said he angrily after he had gone a few steps 
 good god what simplicity 
 nesvitski with a laugh threw his arms round prince andrew but bolkonski turning still paler pushed him away with an angry look and turned to zherkov the nervous irritation aroused by the appearance of mack the news of his defeat and the thought of what lay before the russian army found vent in anger at untimely jest 
 if you sir choose to make a buffoon of yourself he said sharply with a slight trembling of the lower jaw i prevent your doing so but i warn you that if you dare to play the fool in my presence i will teach you to behave yourself 
 nesvitski and zherkov were so surprised by this outburst that they gazed at bolkonski silently with eyes 
 the matter i only congratulated them said zherkov 
 i am not jesting with you please be silent cried bolkonski and taking arm he left zherkov who did not know what to say 
 come the matter old fellow said nesvitski trying to soothe him 
 the matter exclaimed prince andrew standing still in his excitement you understand that either we are officers serving our tsar and our country rejoicing in the successes and grieving at the misfortunes of our common cause or we are merely lackeys who care nothing for their business quarante mille hommes massacres et de nos allies detruite et vous trouvez la le mot pour rire he said as if strengthening his views by this french sentence c est bien pour un garcon de rein comme cet individu dont vous avez fait un ami mais pas pour vous pas pour vous only a hobbledehoy could amuse himself in this way he added in russian but pronouncing the word with a french accent having noticed that zherkov could still hear him 
 forty thousand men massacred and the army of our allies destroyed and you find that a cause for jesting 
 it is all very well for that fellow of whom you have made a friend but not for you not for you 
 he waited a moment to see whether the cornet would answer but he turned and went out of the corridor

 chapter 
 
 yesterday was bright calm and frosty i went to the heights as i proposed my housekeeper entreated me to bear a little note from her to her young lady and i did not refuse for the worthy woman was not conscious of anything odd in her request the front door stood open but the jealous gate was fastened as at my last visit i knocked and invoked earnshaw from among the garden beds he unchained it and i entered the fellow is as handsome a rustic as need be seen i took particular notice of him this time but then he does his best apparently to make the least of his advantages 
 i asked if mr heathcliff were at home he answered no but he would be in at dinner time it was eleven and i announced my intention of going in and waiting for him at which he immediately flung down his tools and accompanied me in the office of watchdog not as a substitute for the host 
 we entered together catherine was there making herself useful in preparing some vegetables for the approaching meal she looked more sulky and less spirited than when i had seen her first she hardly raised her eyes to notice me and continued her employment with the same disregard to common forms of politeness as before never returning my bow and good morning by the slightest acknowledgment 
 she does not seem so amiable i thought as mrs dean would persuade me to believe a beauty it is true but not an angel 
 earnshaw surlily bid her remove her things to the kitchen remove them yourself she said pushing them from her as soon as she had done and retiring to a stool by the window where she began to carve figures of birds and beasts out of the turnip parings in her lap i approached her pretending to desire a view of the garden and as i fancied adroitly dropped mrs note on to her knee unnoticed by she asked aloud what is that and chucked it off 
 a letter from your old acquaintance the housekeeper at the grange i answered annoyed at her exposing my kind deed and fearful lest it should be imagined a missive of my own she would gladly have gathered it up at this information but hareton beat her he seized and put it in his waistcoat saying mr heathcliff should look at it first thereat catherine silently turned her face from us and very stealthily drew out her pocket handkerchief and applied it to her eyes and her cousin after struggling a while to keep down his softer feelings pulled out the letter and flung it on the floor beside her as ungraciously as he could catherine caught and perused it eagerly then she but a few questions to me concerning the inmates rational and irrational of her former home and gazing towards the hills murmured in soliloquy 
 i should like to be riding minny down there i should like to be climbing up there oh stalled hareton and she leant her pretty head back against the sill with half a yawn and half a sigh and lapsed into an aspect of abstracted sadness neither caring nor knowing whether we remarked her 
 mrs heathcliff i said after sitting some time mute you are not aware that i am an acquaintance of yours so intimate that i think it strange you come and speak to me my housekeeper never wearies of talking about and praising you and be greatly disappointed if i return with no news of or from you except that you received her letter and said nothing 
 she appeared to wonder at this speech and asked 
 does ellen like you 
 yes very well i replied unhesitatingly 
 you must tell her she continued that i would answer her letter but l have no materials for writing not even a book from which i might tear a leaf 
 no books i exclaimed how do you contrive to live here without them if l may take the liberty to inquire though provided with a large library frequently very dull at the grange take my books away and i should be desperate 
 i was always reading when i had them said catherine and mr heathcliff never reads so he took it into his head to destroy my books i have not had a glimpse of one for weeks only once i searched through store of theology to his great irritation and once hareton i came upon a secret stock in your latin and greek and some tales and poetry all old friends i brought the last you gathered them as a magpie gathers silver spoons for the mere love of stealing they are of no use to you or else you concealed them in the bad spirit that as you cannot enjoy them nobody else shall perhaps your envy counselled mr heathcliff to rob me of my treasures but most of them written on my brain and printed in my heart and you cannot deprive me of those 
 earnshaw blushed crimson when his cousin made this revelation of his private literary accumulations and stammered an indignant denial of her accusations 
 mr hareton is desirous of increasing his amount of knowledge i said coming to his rescue he is not envious but emulous of your attainments be a clever scholar in a few years 
 and he wants me to sink into a dunce meantime answered catherine yes i hear him trying to spell and read to himself and pretty blunders he makes i wish you would repeat chevy chase as you did yesterday it was extremely funny i heard you and i heard you turning over the dictionary to seek out the hard words and then cursing because you read their explanations 
 the young man evidently thought it too bad that he should be laughed at for his ignorance and then laughed at for trying to remove it i had a similar notion and remembering mrs anecdote of his first attempt at enlightening the darkness in which he had been reared i observed 
 but mrs heathcliff we have each had a commencement and each stumbled and tottered on the threshold had our teachers scorned instead of aiding us we should stumble and totter yet 
 oh she replied i wish to limit his acquirements still he has no right to appropriate what is mine and make it ridiculous to me with his vile mistakes and mispronunciations those books both prose and verse were consecrated to me by other associations and i hate to have them debased and profaned in his mouth besides of all he has selected my favourite pieces that i love the most to repeat as if out of deliberate malice 
 chest heaved in silence a minute he laboured under a severe sense of mortification and wrath which it was no easy task to suppress i rose and from a gentlemanly idea of relieving his embarrassment took up my station in the doorway surveying the external prospect as i stood he followed my example and left the room but presently reappeared bearing half a dozen volumes in his hands which he threw into lap exclaiming 
 take them i never want to hear or read or think of them again 
 i have them now she answered i shall connect them with you and hate them 
 she opened one that had obviously been often turned over and read a portion in the drawling tone of a beginner then laughed and threw it from her and listen she continued provokingly commencing a verse of an old ballad in the same fashion 
 but his would endure no further torment i heard and not altogether disapprovingly a manual check given to her saucy tongue the little wretch had done her utmost to hurt her cousin s sensitive though uncultivated feelings and a physical argument was the only mode he had of balancing the account and repaying its effects on the inflicter he afterwards gathered the books and hurled them on the fire i read in his countenance what anguish it was to offer that sacrifice to spleen i fancied that as they consumed he recalled the pleasure they had already imparted and the triumph and pleasure he had anticipated from them and i fancied i guessed the incitement to his secret studies also he had been content with daily labour and rough animal enjoyments till catherine crossed his path shame at her scorn and hope of her approval were his first prompters to higher pursuits and instead of guarding him from one and winning him to the other his endeavours to rise himself had produced just the contrary result 
 yes all the good that such a brute as you can get from them cried catherine sucking her damaged lip and watching the conflagration with indignant eyes 
 better hold your tongue now he answered fiercely 
 and his agitation precluding further speech he advanced hastily to the entrance where i made way for him to pass but ere he had crossed the doorstones mr heathcliff coming up the causeway encountered him and laying hold of his shoulder asked 
 to do now my lad 
 naught naught he said and broke away to enjoy his grief and anger in solitude 
 heathcliff gazed after him and sighed 
 it will be odd if i thwart myself he muttered unconscious that i was behind him but when i look for his father in his face i find her every day more how the devil is he so like i can hardly bear to see him 
 he bent his eyes to the ground and walked moodily in there was a restless anxious expression in his countenance i had never remarked there before and he looked sparer in person his on perceiving him through the window immediately escaped to the kitchen so that i remained alone 
 glad to see you out of doors again mr lockwood he said in reply to my greeting from selfish motives partly i think i could readily supply your loss in this desolation wondered more than once what brought you here 
 an idle whim i fear sir was my answer or else an idle whim is going to spirit me away i shall set out for london next week and i must give you warning that i feel no disposition to retain thrushcross grange beyond the twelve months i agreed to rent it believe i shall not live there any more 
 oh indeed tired of being banished from the world are you he said but if you be coming to plead off paying for a place you occupy your journey is useless i never relent in exacting my due from anyone 
 coming to plead off nothing about it i exclaimed considerably irritated should you wish it settle with you now and i drew my notebook from my pocket 
 no no he replied coolly leave sufficient behind to cover your debts if you fail to return not in such a hurry sit down and take your dinner with us a guest that is safe from repeating his visit can generally be made welcome catherine bring the things in where are you 
 catherine reappeared bearing a tray of knives and forks 
 you may get your dinner with joseph muttered heathcliff aside and remain in the kitchen till he is gone 
 she obeyed his directions very punctually perhaps she had no temptation to transgress living among clowns and misanthropists she probably cannot appreciate a better class of people when she meets them 
 with mr heathcliff grim and saturnine on the one hand and hareton absolutely dumb on the other i made a somewhat cheerless meal and bid adieu early i would have departed by the back way to get a last glimpse of catherine and annoy old joseph but hareton received orders to lead up my horse and my host himself escorted me to the door so i could not fulfil my wish 
 how dreary life gets over in that house l reflected while riding down the road what a realization of something more romantic than a fairy tale it would have been for mrs linton heathcliff had she and i struck up an attachment as her good nurse desired and migrated together into the stirring atmosphere of the town

 london 
 dearest people 
 here i really sit at a front window of the bath hotel piccadilly not a fashionable place but uncle stopped here years ago and go anywhere else however we mean to stay long so no great matter oh i begin to tell you how i enjoy it all i never can so only give you bits out of my notebook for done nothing but sketch and scribble since i started 
 i sent a line from halifax when i felt pretty miserable but after that i got on delightfully seldom ill on deck all day with plenty of pleasant people to amuse me everyone was very kind to me especially the officers laugh jo gentlemen really are very necessary aboard ship to hold on to or to wait upon one and as they have nothing to do a mercy to make them useful otherwise they would smoke themselves to death afraid 
 aunt and flo were poorly all the way and liked to be let alone so when i had done what i could for them i went and enjoyed myself such walks on deck such sunsets such splendid air and waves it was almost as exciting as riding a fast horse when we went rushing on so grandly i wish beth could have come it would have done her so much good as for jo she would have gone up and sat on the maintop jib or whatever the high thing is called made friends with the engineers and tooted on the speaking trumpet have been in such a state of rapture 
 it was all heavenly but i was glad to see the irish coast and found it very lovely so green and sunny with brown cabins here and there ruins on some of the hills and countryseats in the valleys with deer feeding in the parks it was early in the morning but i regret getting up to see it for the bay was full of little boats the shore so picturesque and a rosy sky overhead i never shall forget it 
 at queenstown on of my new acquaintances left us mr lennox and when i said something about the lakes of killarney he sighed and and with a look at me 
 oh have you heard of kate kearney 
 she lives on the banks of killarney 
 from the glance of her eye 
 shun danger and fly 
 for the glance of kate kearney 
 that nonsensical 
 we only stopped at liverpool a few hours a dirty noisy place and i was glad to leave it uncle rushed out and bought a pair of dogskin gloves some ugly thick shoes and an umbrella and got shaved a la mutton chop the first thing then he flattered himself that he looked like a true briton but the first time he had the mud cleaned off his shoes the little bootblack knew that an american stood in them and said with a grin there yer har sir given em the latest yankee shine it amused uncle immensely oh i must tell you what that absurd lennox did he got his friend ward who came on with us to order a bouquet for me and the first thing i saw in my room was a lovely one with robert compliments on the card that fun girls i like traveling 
 i never shall get to london if i hurry the trip was like riding through a long picture gallery full of lovely landscapes the farmhouses were my delight with thatched roofs ivy up to the eaves latticed windows and stout women with rosy children at the doors the very cattle looked more tranquil than ours as they stood in clover and the hens had a contented cluck as if they never got nervous like yankee biddies such perfect color i never saw the grass so green sky so blue grain so yellow woods so dark i was in a rapture all the way so was flo and we kept bouncing from one side to the other trying to see everything while we were whisking along at the rate of sixty miles an hour aunt was tired and went to sleep but uncle read his guidebook and be astonished at anything this is the way we went on amy flying that must be kenilworth that gray place among the trees flo darting to my sweet we must go there sometime we papa uncle calmly admiring his my dear not unless you want beer a brewery 
 a flo cried out bless me a gallows and a man going up where where shrieks amy staring out at two tall posts with a crossbeam and some dangling chains a colliery remarks uncle with a twinkle of the eye a lovely flock of lambs all lying down says amy see papa they pretty added flo sentimentally geese young ladies returns uncle in a tone that keeps us quiet till flo settles down to enjoy the flirtations of captain cavendish and i have the scenery all to myself 
 of course it rained when we got to london and there was nothing to be seen but fog and umbrellas we rested unpacked and shopped a little between the showers aunt mary got me some new things for i came off in such a hurry i half ready a white hat and blue feather a muslin dress to match and the loveliest mantle you ever saw shopping in regent street is perfectly splendid things seem so cheap nice ribbons only sixpence a yard i laid in a stock but shall get my gloves in paris that sound sort of elegant and rich 
 flo and i for the fun of it ordered a hansom cab while aunt and uncle were out and went for a drive though we learned afterward that it the thing for young ladies to ride in them alone it was so droll for when we were shut in by the wooden apron the man drove so fast that flo was frightened and told me to stop him but he was up outside behind somewhere and i get at him he hear me call nor see me flap my parasol in front and there we were quite helpless rattling away and whirling around corners at a breakneck pace at last in my despair i saw a little door in the roof and on poking it open a red eye appeared and a beery voice said 
 now then mum 
 i gave my order as soberly as i could and slamming down the door with an aye aye mum the man made his horse walk as if going to a funeral i poked again and said a little faster then off he went as before and we resigned ourselves to our fate 
 today was fair and we went to hyde park close by for we are more aristocratic than we look the duke of devonshire lives near i often see his footmen lounging at the back gate and the duke of house is not far off such sights as i saw my dear it was as good as punch for there were fat dowagers rolling about in their red and yellow coaches with gorgeous jeameses in silk stockings and velvet coats up behind and powdered coachmen in front smart maids with the rosiest children i ever saw handsome girls looking half asleep dandies in queer english hats and lavender kids lounging about and tall soldiers in short red jackets and muffin caps stuck on one side looking so funny i longed to sketch them 
 rotten row means route de roi or the way but now more like a riding school than anything else the horses are splendid and the men especially the grooms ride well but the women are stiff and bounce which according to our rules i longed to show them a tearing american gallop for they trotted solemnly up and down in their scant habits and high hats looking like the women in a toy ark everyone men stout ladies little children and the young folks do a deal of flirting here i say a pair exchange rose buds for the thing to wear one in the and i thought it rather a nice little idea 
 in the to westminster abbey but expect me to describe it impossible so only say it was sublime this evening we are going to see fechter which will be an appropriate end to the happiest day of my life 
 very late but i let my letter go in the morning without telling you what happened last evening who do you think came in as we were at tea english friends fred and frank vaughn i was so surprised for i have known them but for the cards both are tall fellows with whiskers fred handsome in the english style and frank much better for he only limps slightly and uses no crutches they had heard from laurie where we were to be and came to ask us to their house but uncle go so we shall return the call and see them as we can they went to the theater with us and we did have such a good time for frank devoted himself to flo and fred and i talked over past present and future fun as if we had know each other all our days tell beth frank asked for her and was sorry to hear of her ill health fred laughed when i spoke of jo and sent his respectful compliments to the big hat neither of them had forgotten camp laurence or the fun we had there what ages ago it seems it 
 aunt is tapping on the wall for the third time so i must stop i really feel like a dissipated london fine lady writing here so late with my room full of pretty things and my head a jumble of parks theaters new gowns and gallant creatures who say ah and twirl their blond mustaches with the true english lordliness i long to see you all and in spite of my nonsense am as ever your loving 
 amy 
 
 
 paris 
 dear girls 
 in my last i told you about our london visit how kind the vaughns were and what pleasant parties they made for us i enjoyed the trips to hampton court and the kensington museum more than anything else for at hampton i saw cartoons and at the museum rooms full of pictures by turner lawrence reynolds hogarth and the other great creatures the day in richmond park was charming for we had a regular english picnic and i had more splendid oaks and groups of deer than i could copy also heard a nightingale and saw larks go up we did london to our content thanks to fred and frank and were sorry to go away for though english people are slow to take you in when they once make up their minds to do it they cannot be outdone in hospitality i think the vaughns hope to meet us in rome next winter and i shall be dreadfully disappointed if they for grace and i are great friends and the boys very nice fellows especially fred 
 well we were hardly settled here when he turned up again saying he had come for a holiday and was going to switzerland aunt looked sober at first but he was so cool about it she say a word and now we get on nicely and are very glad he came for he speaks french like a native and i know what we should do without him uncle know ten words and insists on talking english very loud as if it would make people understand him pronunciation is and flo and i though we flattered ourselves that we knew a good deal find we and are very grateful to have fred do the parley vooing as uncle calls it 
 such delightful times as we are having from morning till night stopping for nice lunches in the gay cafes and meeting with all sorts of droll adventures rainy days i spend in the louvre revelling in pictures jo would turn up her naughty nose at some of the finest because she has no soul for art but i have and cultivation eye and taste as fast as i can she would like the relics of great people better for seen her cocked hat and gray coat his cradle and his old toothbrush also marie little shoe the ring of saint denis sword and many other interesting things talk for hours about them when i come but time to write 
 the palais royale is a heavenly place so full of bijouterie and lovely things that nearly distracted because i buy them fred wanted to get me some but of course i allow it then the bois and champs elysees are tres magnifique seen the imperial family several times the emperor an ugly man the empress pale and pretty but dressed in bad taste i dress green hat and yellow gloves little nap is a handsome boy who sits chatting to his tutor and kissed his hand to the people as he passes in his barouche with postilions in red satin jackets and a mounted guard before and behind 
 we often walk in the tuileries gardens for they are lovely though the antique luxembourg gardens suit me better pere la chaise is very curious for many of the tombs are like small rooms and looking in one sees a table with images or pictures of the dead and chairs for the mourners to sit in when they come to lament that is so frenchy 
 our rooms are on the rue de rivoli and sitting on the balcony we look up and down the long brilliant street it is so pleasant that we spend our evenings talking there when too tired with our work to go out fred is very entertaining and is altogether the most agreeable young man i ever knew except laurie whose manners are more charming i wish fred was dark for i fancy light men however the vaughns are very rich and come of an excellent family so i find fault with their yellow hair as my own is yellower 
 next week we are off to germany and switzerland and as we shall travel fast i shall only be able to give you hasty letters i keep my diary and try to remember correctly and describe clearly all that i see and admire as father advised it is good practice for me and with my sketchbook will give you a better idea of my tour than these scribbles 
 adieu i embrace you tenderly 
 
 votre amie 
 
 heidelberg 
 
 my dear mamma 
 having a quiet hour before we leave for berne try to tell you what has happened for some of it is very important as you will see 
 the sail up the rhine was perfect and i just sat and enjoyed it with all my might get old guidebooks and read about it i words beautiful enough to describe it at coblenz we had a lovely time for some students from bonn with whom fred got acquainted on the boat gave us a serenade it was a moonlight night and about one flo and i were waked by the most delicious music under our windows we flew up and hid behind the curtains but sly peeps showed us fred and the students singing away down below it was the most romantic thing i ever river the bridge of boats the great fortress opposite moonlight everywhere and music fit to melt a heart of stone 
 when they were done we threw down some flowers and saw them scramble for them kiss their hands to the invisible ladies and go laughing away to smoke and drink beer i suppose next morning fred showed me one of the crumpled flowers in his vest pocket and looked very sentimental i laughed at him and said i throw it but flo which seemed to disgust him for he tossed it out of the window and turned sensible again afraid going to have trouble with that boy it begins to look like it 
 the baths at nassau were very gay so was where fred lost some money and i scolded him he needs someone to look after him when frank is not with him kate said once she hoped marry soon and i quite agree with her that it would be well for him frankfurt was delightful i saw house statue and famous ariadne it was very lovely but i should have enjoyed it more if i had known the story better i like to ask as everyone knew it or pretended they did i wish jo would tell me all about it i ought to have read more for i find i know anything and it mortifies me 
 
 now comes the serious part for it happened here and fred has just gone he has been so kind and jolly that we all got quite fond of him i never thought of anything but a traveling friendship till the serenade night since then begun to feel that the moonlight walks balcony talks and daily adventures were something more to him than fun i flirted mother truly but remembered what you said to me and have done my very best i help it if people like me i try to make them and it worries me if i care for them though jo says i got any heart now i know mother will shake her head and the girls say oh the mercenary little wretch but made up my mind and if fred asks me i shall accept him though not madly in love i like him and we get on comfortably together he is handsome young clever enough and very so much richer than the laurences i think his family would object and i should be very happy for they are all kind generous people and they like me fred as the eldest twin will have the estate i suppose and such a splendid one it is a city house in a fashionable street not so showy as our big houses but twice as comfortable and full of solid luxury such as english people believe in i like it for genuine seen the plate the family jewels the old servants and pictures of the country place with its park great house lovely grounds and fine horses oh it would be all i should ask and rather have it than any title such as girls snap up so readily and find nothing behind i may be mercenary but i hate poverty and mean to bear it a minute longer than i can help one of us must marry well meg jo beth yet so i shall and make everything okay all round i marry a man i hated or despised you may be sure of that and though fred is not my model hero he does very well and in time i should get fond enough of him if he was very fond of me and let me do just as i liked so been turning the matter over in my mind the last week for it was impossible to help seeing that fred liked me he said nothing but little things showed it he never goes with flo always gets on my side of the carriage table or promenade looks sentimental when we are alone and frowns at anyone else who ventures to speak tome yesterday at dinner when an austrian officer stared at us and then said something to his friend a baron about ein wonderschones blondchen fred looked as fierce as a lion and cut his meat so savagely it nearly flew off his plate he one of the cool stiff englishmen but is rather peppery for he has scotch blood in him as one might guess from his bonnie blue eyes 
 well last evening we went up to the castle about sunset at least all of us but fred who was to meet us there after going to the post restante for letters we had a charming time poking about the ruins the vaults where the monster tun is and the beautiful gardens made by the elector long ago for his english wife i liked the great terrace best for the view was divine so while the rest went to see the rooms inside i sat there trying to sketch the gray stone head on the wall with scarlet woodbine sprays hanging round it i felt as if got into a romance sitting there watching the meckar rolling through the valley listening to the music of the austrian band below and waiting for my lover like a real storybook girl i had a feeling that something was going to happen and i was ready for it i feel blushy or quakey but quite cool and only a little excited 
 i heard voice and then he came hurrying through the great arch to find me he looked so troubled that i forgot all about myself and asked what the matter was he said just got a letter begging him to come home for frank was very ill so he was going at once on the night train and only had time to say i was very sorry for him and disappointed for myself but only for a minute because he said as he shook hands and said it in a way that i could not mistake i shall soon come back you forget me amy 
 i promise but i looked at him and he seemed satisfied and there was no time for anything but messages and for he was off in an hour and we all miss him very much i know he wanted to speak but i think from something he once hinted that he had promised his father not to do anything of the sort yet a while for is is a rash boy and the old gentleman dreads a foreign we shall soon meet in rome and then if i change my mind say yes thank you when he says will you please 
 of course this is all very private but i wished you to know what was going on be anxious about me remember i am your prudent amy and be sure i will do nothing rashly send me as much advice as you like use it if i can i wish i could see you for a good talk marmee love and trust me 
 ever your amy

lionfish nov chapter the third taskcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 dumbledore reckons getting stronger again as well ron whispered 
 
 everything harry had seen in the pensieve nearly everything dumbledore had told and shown him afterward he had now shared with ron and hermione and of course with sirius to whom harry had sent an owl the moment he had left office harry ron and hermione sat up late in the common room once again that night talking it all over until mind was reeling until he understood what dumbledore had meant about a head becoming so full of thoughts that it would have been a relief to siphon them off 
 
 ron stared into the common room fire harry thought he saw ron shiver slightly even though the evening was warm 
 
 and he trusts snape ron said he really trusts snape even though he knows he was a death eater 
 
 yes said harry 
 
 hermione had not spoken for ten minutes she was sitting with her forehead in her hands staring at her knees harry thought she too looked as though she could have done with a pensieve 
 
 rita skeeter she muttered finally 
 
 how can you be worrying about her now said ron in utter disbelief 
 
 not worrying about her hermione said to her knees just thinkingremember what she said to me in the three broomsticks i know things about ludo bagman that would make your hair curl this is what she meant it she reported his trial she knew passed information to the death eaters and winky too a bad wizard mr crouch would have been furious he got off he would have talked about it at home 
 
 yeah but bagman pass information on purpose did he 
 
 hermione shrugged 
 
 and fudge reckons madame maxime attacked crouch ron said turning back to harry 
 
 yeah said harry but only saying that because crouch disappeared near the beauxbatons carriage 
 
 we never thought of her did we said ron slowly mind you definitely got giant blood and she want to admit it 
 
 of course she said hermione sharply looking up look what happened to hagrid when rita found out about his mother look at fudge jumping to conclusions about her just because part giant who needs that sort of prejudice probably say i had big bones if i knew what get for telling the truth 
 
 hermione looked at her watch we done any practicing she said looking shocked we were going to do the impediment curse have to really get down to it tomorrow come on harry you need to get some sleep 
 
 harry and ron went slowly upstairs to their dormitory as harry pulled on his pajamas he looked over at bed true to his word to dumbledore he had not told ron and hermione about parents as harry took off his glasses and climbed into his he imagined how it must feel to have parents still living but unable to recognize you he often got sympathy from strangers for being an orphan but as he listened to snores he thought that neville deserved it more than he did lying in the darkness harry felt a rush of anger and hate toward the people who had tortured mr and mrs remembered the jeers of the crowd as son and his companions had been dragged from the court by the understood how they had he remembered the face of the screaming boy and realized with a jolt that he had died a year later 
 
 it was voldemort harry thought staring up at the canopy of his bed in the darkness it all came back to was the one who had torn these families apart who had ruined all these lives 
 
 ron and hermione were supposed to be studying for their exams which would finish on the day of the third task but they were putting most of their efforts into helping harry prepare 
 
 worry about it hermione said shortly when harry pointed this out to them and said he mind practicing on his own for a while at least get top marks in defense against the dark arts never have found out about all these hexes in class 
 
 good training for when all aurors said ron excitedly attempting the impediment curse on a wasp that had buzzed into the room and making it stop dead in midair 
 
 the mood in the castle as they entered june became excited and tense again everyone was looking forward to the third task which would take place a week before the end of term harry was practicing hexes at every available moment he felt more confident about this task than either of the others difficult and dangerous though it would undoubtedly be moody was right harry had managed to find his way past monstrous creatures and enchanted barriers before now and this time he had some notice some chance to prepare himself for what lay ahead 
 
 tired of walking in on harry hermione and ron all over the school professor mcgonagall had given them permission to use the empty transfiguration classroom at lunchtimes harry had soon mastered the impediment curse a spell to slow down and obstruct attackers the reductor curse which would enable him to blast solid objects out of his way and the spell a useful discovery of that would make his wand point due north therefore enabling him to check whether he was going in the right direction within the maze he was still having trouble with the shield charm though this was supposed to cast a temporary invisible wall around himself that deflected minor curses hermione managed to shatter it with a jinx and harry wobbled around the room for ten minutes afterward before she had looked up the 
 
 still doing really well though hermione said encouragingly looking down her list and crossing off those spells they had already learned some of these are bound to come in handy 
 
 come and look at this said ron who was standing by the window he was staring down onto the grounds malfoy doing 
 
 harry and hermione went to see malfoy crabbe and goyle were standing in the shadow of a tree below crabbe and goyle seemed to be keeping a lookout both were smirking malfoy was holding his hand up to his mouth and speaking into it 
 
 he looks like using a said harry curiously 
 
 he be said hermione told you those sorts of things work around hogwarts come on harry she added briskly turning away from the window and moving back into the middle of the room try that shield charm again 
 
 sirius was sending daily owls now like hermione he seemed to want to concentrate on getting harry through the last task before they concerned themselves with anything else he reminded harry in every letter that whatever might be going on outside the walls of hogwarts was not responsibility nor was it within his power to influence it 
 
 if voldemort is really getting stronger again he wrote my priority is to ensure your safety he cannot hope to lay hands on you while you are under protection but all the same take no risks concentrate on getting through that maze safely and then we can turn our attention to other matters 
 nerves mounted as june the drew closer but they were not as bad as those he had felt before the first and second tasks for one thing he was confident that this time he had done everything in his power to prepare for the task for another this was the final hurdle and however well or badly he did the tournament would at last be over which would be an enormous relief 
 
 
 
 breakfast was a very noisy affair at the gryffindor table on the morning of the third task the post owls appeared bringing harry a card from sirius it was only a piece of parchment folded over and bearing a muddy paw print on its front but harry appreciated it all the same a screech owl arrived for hermione carrying her morning copy of the daily prophet as usual she unfolded the paper glanced at the front page and spat out a mouthful of pumpkin juice all over it 
 
 what said harry and ron together staring at her nothing said hermione quickly trying to shove the paper out of sight but ron grabbed it he stared at the headline and said no way not today that old cow 
 
 what said harry rita skeeter again 
 
 no said ron and just like hermione he attempted to push the paper out of sight 
 
 about me it said harry 
 
 no said ron in an entirely unconvincing tone but before harry could demand to see the paper draco malfoy shouted across the great hall from the slytherin table 
 
 hey potter potter your head you feeling all right sure not going to go berserk on us 
 
 malfoy was holding a copy of the daily prophet too slytherins up and down the table were sniggering twisting in their seats to see reaction 
 
 let me see it harry said to ron give it here 
 
 very reluctantly ron handed over the newspaper harry turned it over and found himself staring at his own picture beneath the banner headline 
 
 harry potter 
 disturbed and dangerous 
 the boy who defeated is unstable and possibly dangerous writes rita skeeter special correspondent alarming evidence has recently come to light about harry strange behavior which casts doubts upon his suitability to compete in a demanding competition like the triwizard tournament or even to attend hogwarts school 
 potter the daily prophet can exclusively reveal regularly collapses at school and is often heard to complain of pain in the scar on his forehead relic of the curse with which attempted to kill him on monday last midway through a divination lesson your daily prophet reporter witnessed potter storming from the class claiming that his scar was hurting too badly to continue studying 
 it is possible say top experts at st hospital for magical maladies and injuries that potters brain was affected by the attack inflicted upon him by and that his insistence that the scar is still hurting is an expression of his confusion 
 he might even be pretending said one specialist this could be a plea for attention 
 the daily prophet however has unearthed worrying facts about harry potter that albus dumbledore headmaster of hogwarts has carefully concealed from the wizarding public 
 potter can speak parseltongue reveals draco malfoy a hogwarts fourth year there were a lot of attacks on students a couple of years ago and most people thought potter was behind them after they saw him lose his temper at a dueling club and set a snake on another boy it was all hushed up though but made friends with werewolves and giants too we think do anything for a bit of power 
 parseltongue the ability to converse with snakes has long been considered a dark art indeed the most famous parselmouth of our times is none other than himself a member of the dark force defense league who wished to remain unnamed stated that he would regard any wizard who could speak parseltongue as worthy of investigation personally i would be highly suspicious of anybody who could converse with snakes as serpents are often used in the worst kinds of dark magic and are historically associated with evildoers similarly anyone who seeks out the company of such vicious creatures as werewolves and giants would appear to have a fondness for violence 
 albus dumbledore should surely consider whether a boy such as this should be allowed to compete in the triwizard tournament some fear that potter might resort to the dark arts in his desperation to win the tournament the third task of which takes place this evening 
 gone off me a bit she said harry lightly folding up the paper 
 
 over at the slytherin table malfoy crabbe and goyle were laughing at him tapping their heads with their fingers pulling grotesquely mad faces and waggling their tongues like snakes 
 
 how did she know your scar hurt in divination ron said no way she was there no way she heard 
 
 the window was open said harry i opened it to breathe 
 
 you were at the top of north tower hermione said your voice have carried all the way down to the grounds 
 
 well the one supposed to be researching magical methods of bugging said harry you tell me how she did it 
 
 been trying said hermione but ibut 
 
 an odd dreamy expression suddenly came over face she slowly raised a hand and ran her fingers through her hair 
 
 are you all right said ron frowning at her 
 
 yes said hermione breathlessly she ran her fingers through her hair again and then held her hand up to her mouth as though speaking into an invisible harry and ron stared at each other 
 
 had an idea hermione said gazing into space i think i knowbecause then no one would be able to seeeven moodyand have been able to get onto the window ledgebut not definitely not allowedi think got her just give me two seconds in the library just to make sure 
 
 with that hermione seized her school bag and dashed out of the great hall 
 
 oi ron called after her got our history of magic exam in ten minutes blimey he said turning back to harry she must really hate that skeeter woman to risk missing the start of an exam you going to do in class read again 
 
 exempt from the tests as a triwizard champion harry had been sitting in the back of every exam class so far looking up fresh hexes for the third task 
 
 so harry said to ron but just then professor mcgonagall came walking alongside the gryffindor table toward him 
 
 potter the champions are congregating in the chamber off the hall after breakfast she said 
 
 but the not till tonight said harry accidentally spilling scrambled eggs down his front afraid he had mistaken the time 
 
 aware of that potter she said the champions families are invited to watch the final task you know this is simply a chance for you to greet them 
 
 she moved away harry gaped after her 
 
 she expect the dursleys to turn up does she he asked ron blankly 
 
 dunno said ron harry better hurry going to be late for binns see you later 
 
 harry finished his breakfast in the emptying great hall he saw fleur delacour get up from the ravenclaw table and join cedric as he crossed to the side chamber and entered krum slouched off to join them shortly afterward harry stayed where he was he really want to go into the chamber he had no family no family who would turn up to see him risk his life anyway but just as he was getting up thinking that he might as well go up to the library and do a spot more hex research the door of the side chamber opened and cedric stuck his head out 
 
 harry come on waiting for you 
 
 utterly perplexed harry got up the dursleys possibly be here could they he walked across the hall and opened the door into the chamber 
 
 cedric and his parents were just inside the door viktor krum was over in a corner conversing with his mother and father in rapid bulgarian he had inherited his fathers hooked nose on the other side of the room fleur was jabbering away in french to her mother little sister gabrielle was holding her hand she waved at harry who waved back grinning then he saw mrs weasley and bill standing in front of the fireplace beaming at him 
 
 surprise mrs weasley said excitedly as he smiled broadly and walked over to them thought come and watch you harry she bent down and kissed him on the cheek 
 
 you all right said bill grinning at harry and shaking his hand charlie wanted to come but he get time off he said you were incredible against the horntail 
 
 fleur delacour harry noticed was eyeing bill with great interest over her shoulder harry could tell she had no objection whatsoever to long hair or earrings with fangs on them 
 
 this is really nice of you harry muttered to mrs weasley i thought for a moment the dursleys 
 
 hmm said mrs weasley pursing her lips she had always refrained from criticizing the dursleys in front of harry but her eyes flashed every time they were mentioned 
 
 great being back here said bill looking around the chamber violet the fat friend winked at him from her frame seen this place for five years is that picture of the mad knight still around sir cadogan 
 
 oh yeah said harry who had met sir cadogan the previous year 
 
 and the fat lady said bill 
 
 she was here in my time said mrs weasley she gave me such a telling off one night when i got back to the dormitory at four in the morning 
 
 what were you doing out of your dormitory at four in the morning said bill surveying his mother with amazement 
 
 mrs weasley grinned her eyes twinkling 
 
 your father and i had been for a nighttime stroll she said he got caught by apollyon pringle he was the caretaker in those days your still got the marks 
 
 fancy giving us a tour harry said bill 
 
 yeah okay said harry and they made their way back toward the door into the great hall as they passed amos diggory he looked around 
 
 there you are are you he said looking harry up and down 
 
 bet not feeling quite as full of yourself now caught you up on points are you 
 
 what said harry 
 
 ignore him said cedric in a low voice to harry frowning after his father been angry ever since rita article about the triwizard tournament you know when she made out you were the only hogwarts champion 
 
 bother to correct her though did he said amos diggory loudly enough for harry to hear as he started to walk out of the door with mrs weasley and bill show him ced beaten him once before you 
 
 rita skeeter goes out of her way to cause trouble amos mrs weasley said angrily i would have thought know that working at the ministry 
 
 mr diggory looked as though he was going to say something angry but his wife laid a hand on his arm and he merely shrugged and turned away 
 
 harry had a very enjoyable morning walking over the sunny grounds with bill and mrs weasley showing them the beauxbatons carriage and the durmstrang ship mrs weasley was intrigued by the whomping willow which had been planted after she had left school and reminisced at length about the gamekeeper before hagrid a man called ogg 
 
 percy harry asked as they walked around the greenhouses 
 
 not good said bill 
 
 very upset said mrs weasley lowering her voice and glancing around the ministry wants to keep mr disappearance quiet but been hauled in for questioning about the instructions mr crouch has been sending in they seem to think a chance they genuinely written by him been under a lot of strain not letting him fill in for mr crouch as the fifth judge tonight cornelius fudge is going to be doing it 
 
 they returned to the castle for lunch 
 
 mum bill said ron looking stunned as he joined the gryffindor table you doing here 
 
 come to watch harry in the last task said mrs weasley brightly i must say it makes a lovely change not having to cook how was your exam 
 
 ohokay said ron remember all the goblin rebels names so i invented a few all right he said helping himself to a cornish pasty while mrs weasley looked stern all called stuff like bodrod the bearded and urg the unclean it hard 
 
 fred george and ginny came to sit next to them too and harry was having such a good time he felt almost as though he were back at the burrow he had forgotten to worry about that task and not until hermione turned up halfway through lunch did he remember that she had had a brainwave about rita skeeter 
 
 are you going to tell us 
 
 hermione shook her head warningly and glanced at mrs weasley 
 
 hello hermione said mrs weasley much more stiffly than usual 
 
 hello said hermione her smile faltering at the cold expression on mrs face 
 
 harry looked between them then said mrs weasley you believe that rubbish rita skeeter wrote in witch weekly did you because not my girlfriend 
 
 oh said mrs weasley no of course i 
 
 but she became considerably warmer toward hermione after that 
 
 harry bill and mrs weasley whiled away the afternoon with a long walk around the castle and then returned to the great hall for the evening feast ludo bagman and cornelius fudge had joined the staff table now bagman looked quite cheerful but cornelius fudge who was sitting next to madame maxime looked stern and was not talking madame maxime was concentrating on her plate and harry thought her eyes looked red hagrid kept glancing along the table at her 
 
 there were more courses than usual but harry who was starting to feel really nervous now eat much as the enchanted ceiling overhead began to fade from blue to a dusky purple dumbledore rose to his feet at the staff table and silence fell 
 
 ladies and gentlemen in five minutes time i will be asking you to make your way down to the quidditch field for the third and final task of the triwizard tournament will the champions please follow mr bagman down to the stadium now 
 
 harry got up the gryffindors all along the table were applauding him the weasleys and hermione all wished him good luck and he headed off out of the great hall with cedric fleur and viktor 
 
 feeling all right harry bagman asked as they went down the stone steps onto the grounds confident 
 
 okay said harry it was sort of true he was nervous but he kept running over all the hexes and spells he had been practicing in his mind as they walked and the knowledge that he could remember them all made him feel better 
 
 they walked onto the quidditch field which was now completely unrecognizable a hedge ran all the way around the edge of it there was a gap right in front of them the entrance to the vast maze the passage beyond it looked dark and creepy 
 
 five minutes later the stands had begun to fill the air was full of excited voices and the rumbling of feet as the hundreds of students filed into their seats the sky was a deep clear blue now and the first stars were starting to appear hagrid professor moody professor mcgonagall and professor flitwick came walking into the stadium and approached bagman and the champions they were wearing large red luminous stars on their hats all except hagrid who had his on the back of his moleskin vest 
 
 we are going to be patrolling the outside of the maze said professor mcgonagall to the champions if you get into difficulty and wish to be rescued send red sparks into the air and one of us will come and get you do you understand 
 
 the champions nodded 
 
 off you go then said bagman brightly to the four patrollers 
 
 good luck harry hagrid whispered and the four of them walked away in different directions to station themselves around the maze bagman now pointed his wand at his throat muttered sonorus and his magically magnified voice echoed into the stands 
 
 ladies and gentlemen the third and final task of the triwizard tournament is about to begin let me remind you how the points currently stand tied in first place with points each mr cedric diggory and mr harry potter both of hogwarts school the cheers and applause sent birds from the forbidden forest fluttering into the darkening sky in second place with eighty points mr viktor krum of durmstrang institute more applause and in third place miss fleur delacour of beauxbatons academy 
 
 harry could just make out mrs weasley bill ron and hermione applauding fleur politely halfway up the stands he waved up at them and they waved back beaming at him 
 
 soon my whistle harry and cedric said bagman three two one 
 
 he gave a short blast on his whistle and harry and cedric hurried forward into the maze 
 
 the towering hedges cast black shadows across the path and whether because they were so tall and thick or because they had been enchanted the sound of the surrounding crowd was silenced the moment they entered the maze harry felt almost as though he were underwater again he pulled out his wand muttered lumos and heard cedric do the same just behind him 
 
 after about fifty yards they reached a fork they looked at each other 
 
 see you harry said and he took the left one while cedric took the right 
 
 harry heard whistle for the second time krum had entered the maze harry sped up his chosen path seemed completely deserted he turned right and hurried on holding his wand high over his head trying to see as far ahead as possible still there was nothing in sight 
 
 whistle blew in the distance for the third time all of the champions were now inside 
 
 harry kept looking behind him the old feeling that he was being watched was upon him the maze was growing darker with every passing minute as the sky overhead deepened to navy he reached a second fork 
 
 point me he whispered to his wand holding it flat in his palm 
 
 the wand spun around once and pointed toward his right into solid hedge that way was north and he knew that he needed to go northwest for the center of the maze the best he could do was to take the left fork and go right again as soon as possible 
 
 the path ahead was empty too and when harry reached a right turn and took it he again found his way unblocked harry know why but the lack of obstacles was unnerving him surely he should have met something by now it felt as though the maze were luring him into a false sense of security then he heard movement right behind him he held out his wand ready to attack but its beam fell only upon cedric who had just hurried out of a path on the side cedric looked severely shaken the sleeve of his robe was smoking 
 
 skrewts he hissed enormous i only just got away 
 
 he shook his head and dived out of sight along another path keen to put plenty of distance between himself and the skrewts harry hurried off again then as he turned a corner he sawa dementor gliding toward him twelve feet tall its face hidden by its hood its rotting scabbed hands outstretched it advanced sensing its way blindly toward him harry could hear its rattling breath he felt clammy coldness stealing over him but knew what he had to do 
 
 he summoned the happiest thought he could concentrated with all his might on the thought of getting out of the maze and celebrating with ron and hermione raised his wand and cried expecto patronum 
 
 a silver stag erupted from the end of wand and galloped toward the dementor which fell back and tripped over the hem of its had never seen a dementor stumble 
 
 hang on he shouted advancing in the wake of his silver patronus a boggart riddikulus 
 
 there was a loud crack and the exploded in a wisp of smoke the silver stag faded from sight harry wished it could have stayed he could have used some companybut he moved on quickly and quietly as possible listening hard his wand held high once more 
 
 leftrightleft againtwice he found himself facing dead ends he did the spell again and found that he was going too far east he turned back took a right turn and saw an odd golden mist floating ahead of him 
 
 harry approached it cautiously pointing the beam at it this looked like some kind of enchantment he wondered whether he might be able to blast it out of the way 
 
 reducio he said 
 
 the spell shot straight through the mist leaving it intact he supposed he should have known better the reductor curse was for solid objects what would happen if he walked through the mist was it worth chancing it or should he double back 
 
 he was still hesitating when a scream shattered the silence 
 
 fleur harry yelled 
 
 there was silence he stared all around him what had happened to her her scream seemed to have come from somewhere ahead he took a deep breath and ran through the enchanted mist 
 
 the world turned upside down harry was hanging from the ground with his hair on end his glasses dangling off his nose threatening to fall into the bottomless sky he clutched them to the end of his nose and hung there terrified it felt as though his feet were glued to the grass which had now become the ceiling below him the dark heavens stretched endlessly he felt as though if he tried to move one of his feet he would fall away from the earth completely 
 
 think he told himself as all the blood rushed to his head think 
 
 but not one of the spells he had practiced had been designed to combat a sudden reversal of ground and sky did he dare move his foot he could hear the blood pounding in his ears he had two choices try and move or send up red sparks and get rescued and disqualified from the task 
 
 he shut his eyes so he be able to see the view of endless space below him and pulled his right foot as hard as he could away from the grassy ceiling 
 
 immediately the world righted itself harry fell forward onto his knees onto the wonderfully solid ground he felt temporarily limp with shock he took a deep steadying breath then got up again and hurried forward looking back over his shoulder as he ran away from the golden mist which twinkled innocently at him in the moonlight 
 
 he paused at a junction of two paths and looked around for some sign of fleur he was sure it had been she who had screamed what had she met was she all right there was no sign of red sparks did that mean she had got herself out of trouble or was she in such trouble that she reach her wand harry took the right fork with a feeling of increasing uneasebut at the same time he help thinking one champion down 
 
 the cup was somewhere close by and it sounded as though fleur was no longer in the running got this far he what if he actually managed to win fleetingly and for the first time since found himself champion he saw again that image of himself raising the triwizard cup in front of the rest of the school 
 
 he met nothing for ten minutes but kept running into dead ends twice he took the same wrong turning finally he found a new route and started to jog along it his wandlight waving making his shadow flicker and distort on the hedge walls then he rounded another corner and found himself facing a skrewt 
 
 cedric was right it was enormous ten feet long it looked more like a giant scorpion than anything its long sting was curled over its back its thick armor glinted in the light from wand which he pointed at it 
 
 stupefy 
 
 the spell hit the armor and rebounded harry ducked just in time but could smell burning hair it had singed the top of his head the skrewt issued a blast of fire from its end and flew forward toward him 
 
 impedimenta harry yelled the spell hit the armor again and ricocheted off harry staggered back a few paces and fell over impedimenta 
 
 the skrewt was inches from him when it froze he had managed to hit it on its fleshy underside panting harry pushed himself away from it and ran hard in the opposite direction the impediment curse was not permanent the skrewt would be regaining the use of its legs at any moment 
 
 he took a left path and hit a dead end a right and hit another forcing himself to stop heart hammering he performed the spell again backtracked and chose a path that would take him northwest 
 
 he had been hurrying along the new path for a few minutes when he heard something in the path running parallel to his own that made him stop dead 
 
 what are you doing yelled voice what the hell think doing 
 
 and then harry heard voice 
 
 crucio 
 
 the air was suddenly full of yells horrified harry began sprinting up his path trying to find a way into when none appeared he tried the reductor curse again it very effective but it burned a small hole in the hedge through which harry forced his leg kicking at the thick brambles and branches until they broke and made an opening he struggled through it tearing his robes and looking to his right saw cedric jerking and twitching on the ground krum standing over him 
 
 harry pulled himself up and pointed his wand at krum just as krum looked up krum turned and began to run 
 
 stupefy harry yelled 
 
 the spell hit krum in the back he stopped dead in his tracks fell forward and lay motionless facedown in the grass over to cedric who had stopped twitching and was lying there panting his hands over his face 
 
 are you all right harry said roughly grabbing arm 
 
 yeah panted cedric yeahi believe ithe crept up behind heard him i turned around and he had his wand on me 
 
 cedric got up he was still shaking he and harry looked down at krum 
 
 i believe thisi thought he was all right harry said staring at krum 
 
 so did i said cedric 
 
 did you hear fleur scream earlier said harry 
 
 yeah said cedric you think krum got her too 
 
 i know said harry slowly 
 
 should we leave him here cedric muttered 
 
 no said harry i reckon we should send up red sparks come and collect himotherwise probably be eaten by a skrewt 
 
 deserve it cedric muttered but all the same he raised his wand and shot a shower of red sparks into the air which hovered high above krum marking the spot where he lay 
 
 harry and cedric stood there in the darkness for a moment looking around them then cedric said welli better go on 
 
 what said harry ohyeahright 
 
 it was an odd moment he and cedric had been briefly united against krum now the fact that they were opponents came back to harry the two of them proceeded up the dark path without speaking then harry turned left and cedric right footsteps soon died away 
 
 harry moved on continuing to use the spell making sure he was moving in the right direction it was between him and cedric now his desire to reach the cup first was now burning stronger than ever but he could hardly believe what just seen krum do the use of an unforgivable curse on a fellow human being meant a life term in azkaban that was what moody had told them krum surely have wanted the triwizard cup that sped up 
 
 every so often he hit more dead ends but the increasing darkness made him feel sure he was getting near the heart of the maze then as he strode down a long straight path he saw movement once again and his beam of wandlight hit an extraordinary creature one which he had only seen in picture form in his monster book of monsters 
 
 it was a sphinx it had the body of an lion great clawed paws and a long yellowish tail ending in a brown tuft its head however was that of a woman she turned her long eyes upon harry as he approached he raised his wand hesitating she was not crouching as if to spring but pacing from side to side of the path blocking his progress then she spoke in a deep hoarse voice 
 
 you are very near your goal the quickest way is past me 
 
 soso will you move please said harry knowing what the answer was going to be 
 
 no she said continuing to pace not unless you can answer my riddle answer on your first guess i let you pass answer wrongly i attack remain silent i will let you walk away from me unscathed 
 
 stomach slipped several notches it was hermione who was good at this sort of thing not him he weighed his chances if the riddle was too hard he could keep silent get away from the sphinx unharmed and try and find an alternative route to the center 
 
 okay he said can i hear the riddle 
 
 the sphinx sat down upon her hind legs in the very middle of the path and recited 
 
 first think of the person who lives in disguise 
 who deals in secrets and tells naught but lies 
 next tell me always the last thing to mend 
 the middle of middle and end of the end 
 and finally give me the sound often heard 
 during the search for a word 
 now string them together and answer me this 
 which creature would you be unwilling to kiss 
 
 harry gaped at her 
 
 could i have it againmore slowly he asked tentatively she blinked at him smiled and repeated the poem all the clues add up to a creature i want to kiss harry asked 
 
 she merely smiled her mysterious smile harry took that for a yes harry cast his mind around there were plenty of animals he want to kiss his immediate thought was a skrewt but something told him that the answer have to try and work out the clues 
 
 a person in disguise harry muttered staring at her who be a an impostor no not my guess a a spy come back to thatcould you give me the next clue again please 
 
 she repeated the next lines of the poem 
 
 the last thing to mend harry repeated erno of i have the last bit again 
 
 she gave him the last four lines 
 
 the sound often heard during the search for a word said harry beerhang on er a sound 
 
 the sphinx smiled at him 
 
 spyerspyer said harry pacing up and down a creature i want to kissa spider 
 
 the sphinx smiled more broadly she got up stretched her front legs and then moved aside for him to pass 
 
 thanks said harry and amazed at his own brilliance he dashed forward 
 
 he had to be close now he had to wand was telling him he was bang on course as long as he meet anything too horrible he might have a chance 
 
 harry broke into a run he had a choice of paths up ahead point me he whispered again to his wand and it spun around and pointed him to the one he dashed up this one and saw light ahead 
 
 the triwizard cup was gleaming on a plinth a hundred yards away suddenly a dark figure hurtled out onto the path in front of him 
 
 cedric was going to get there first cedric was sprinting as fast as he could toward the cup and harry knew he would never catch up cedric was much taller had much longer legs 
 
 then harry saw something immense over a hedge to his left moving quickly along a path that intersected with his own it was moving so fast cedric was about to run into it and cedric his eyes on the cup had not seen it 
 
 cedric harry bellowed on your left 
 
 cedric looked around just in time to hurl himself past the thing and avoid colliding with it but in his haste he tripped harry saw wand fly out of his hand as a gigantic spider stepped into the path and began to bear down upon cedric 
 
 stupefy harry yelled the spell hit the gigantic hairy black body but for all the good it did he might as well have thrown a stone at it the spider jerked scuttled around and ran at harry instead 
 
 stupefy impedimenta stupefy 
 
 but it was no use the spider was either so large or so magical that the spells were doing no more than aggravating it harry had one horrifying glimpse of eight shining black eyes and pincers before it was upon him 
 
 he was lifted into the air in its front legs struggling madly he tried to kick it his leg connected with the pincers and next moment he was in excruciating pain he could hear cedric yelling stupefy too but his spell had no more effect than harry raised his wand as the spider opened its pincers once more and shouted expelliarmus 
 
 it worked the disarming spell made the spider drop him but that meant that harry fell twelve feet onto his already injured leg which crumpled beneath him without pausing to think he aimed high at the underbelly as he had done with the skrewt and shouted as cedric yelled the same thing 
 
 the two spells combined did what one alone had not the spider keeled over sideways flattening a nearby hedge and strewing the path with a tangle of hairy legs 
 
 harry he heard cedric shouting you all right did it fall on you 
 
 no harry called back panting he looked down at his leg it was bleeding freely he could see some sort of thick gluey secretion from the pincers on his torn robes he tried to get up but his leg was shaking badly and did not want to support his weight he leaned against the hedge gasping for breath and looked around 
 
 cedric was standing feet from the triwizard cup which was gleaming behind him 
 
 take it then harry panted to cedric go on take it there 
 
 but cedric move he merely stood there looking at harry then he turned to stare at the cup harry saw the longing expression on his face in its golden light cedric looked around at harry again who was now holding onto the hedge to support himself cedric took a deep breath 
 
 you take it you should win twice saved my neck in here 
 
 not how supposed to work harry said he felt angry his leg was very painful he was aching all over from trying to throw off the spider and after all his efforts cedric had beaten him to it just as beaten harry to ask cho to the ball the one who reaches the cup first gets the points you telling you not going to win any races on this leg 
 
 cedric took a few paces nearer to the stunned spider away from the cup shaking his head 
 
 no he said 
 
 stop being noble said harry irritably just take it then we can get out of here 
 
 cedric watched harry steadying himself holding tight to the hedge 
 
 you told me about the dragons cedric said i gone down in the first task if you told me what was coming 
 
 i had help on that too harry snapped trying to mop up his bloody leg with his robes you helped me with the egg square 
 
 i had help on the egg in the first place said cedric 
 
 still square said harry testing his leg gingerly it shook violently as he put weight on it he had sprained his ankle when the spider had dropped him 
 
 you got more points on the second task said cedric mulishly you stayed behind to get all the hostages i done that 
 
 i was the only one who was thick enough to take that song seriously said harry bitterly just take the cup 
 
 no said cedric 
 
 he stepped over the tangled legs to join harry who stared at him cedric was serious he was walking away from the sort of glory hufflepuff house had in centuries 
 
 go on cedric said he looked as though this was costing him every ounce of resolution he had but his face was set his arms were folded he seemed decided 
 
 harry looked from cedric to the cup for one shining moment he saw himself emerging from the maze holding it he saw himself holding the triwizard cup aloft heard the roar of the crowd saw face shining with admiration more clearly than he had ever seen it beforeand then the picture faded and he found himself staring at shadowy stubborn face 
 
 both of us harry said 
 
 what 
 
 take it at the same time still a hogwarts victory tie for it 
 
 cedric stared at harry he unfolded his arms 
 
 you you sure 
 
 yeah said harry helped each other out we we both got here just take it together 
 
 for a moment cedric looked as though he believe his ears then his face split in a grin 
 
 on he said come here 
 
 he grabbed arm below the shoulder and helped harry limp toward the plinth where the cup stood when they had reached it they both held a hand out over one of the gleaming handles 
 
 on three right said harry one two three 
 
 he and cedric both grasped a handle 
 
 instantly harry felt a jerk somewhere behind his navel his feet had left the ground he could not unclench the hand holding the triwizard cup it was pulling him onward in a howl of wind and swirling color cedric at his side 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the goblet of fire 
 

lionfish nov chapter owlscontents prev chapter next chapter 
 euphoria at helping gryffindor scrape the quidditch cup was such that he settle to anything next day all he wanted to do was talk over the match so harry and hermione found it very difficult to find an opening in which to mention grawp not that either of them tried very hard neither was keen to be the one to bring ron back to reality in quite such a brutal fashion as it was another fine warm day they persuaded him to join them in revising under the beech tree at the edge of the lake where they had less chance of being overheard than in the common room ron was not particularly keen on this idea at firsthe was thoroughly enjoying being patted on the back by every gryffindor who walked past his chair not to mention the occasional outbursts of weasley is our after a while he agreed that some fresh air might do him good 
 
 they spread their books out in the shade of the beech tree and sat down while ron talked them through his first save of the match for what felt like the dozenth time 
 
 well i mean already let in that one of so i feeling all that confident but i dunno when bradley came towards me just out of nowhere i thoughtyou can do this and i had about a second to decide which way to fly you know because he looked like he was aiming for the right goalhoop my right obviously his leftbut i had a funny feeling that he was feinting and so i took the chance and flew lefthis right i meanandwellyou saw what happened he concluded modestly sweeping his hair back quite unnecessarily so that it looked interestingly windswept and glancing around to see whether the people nearest to thema bunch of gossiping hufflepuffshad heard him and then when chambers came at me about five minutes laterwhat ron asked having stopped at the look on face why are you grinning 
 
 not said harry quickly and looked down at his transfiguration notes attempting to straighten his lace the truth was that ron had just reminded harry forcibly of another gryffindor quidditch player who had once sat rumpling his hair under this very tree just glad we won all 
 
 yeah said ron slowly savouring the words we you see the look on face when ginny got the snitch right out from under her nose 
 
 i suppose she cried did she said harry bitterly 
 
 well yeah more out of temper than anything though ron frowned slightly but you saw her chuck her broom away when she got back to the ground you 
 
 er said harry 
 
 well actually no ron said hermione with a heavy sigh putting down her book and looking at him apologetically as a matter of fact the only bit of the match harry and i saw was first goal 
 
 carefully ruffled hair seemed to wilt with disappointment you watch he said faintly looking from one to the other you see me make any of those saves 
 
 wellno said hermione stretching out a placatory hand towards him but ron we want to leavewe had to 
 
 yeah said ron whose face was growing rather red how come 
 
 it was hagrid said harry he decided to tell us why been covered in injuries ever since he got back from the giants he wanted us to go into the forest with him we had no choice you know how he gets anyway 
 
 the story was told in five minutes by the end of which indignation had been replaced by a look of total incredulity 
 
 he brought one back and hid it in the forest 
 
 yep said harry grimly 
 
 no said ron as though by saying this he could make it untrue no he have 
 
 well he has said hermione firmly about sixteen feet tall enjoys ripping up pine trees and knows me she snorted as hermy 
 
 ron gave a nervous laugh 
 
 and hagrid wants us to 
 
 teach him english yeah said harry 
 
 lost his mind said ron in an almost awed voice 
 
 yes said hermione irritably turning a page of intermediate transfiguration and glaring at a series of diagrams showing an owl turning into a pair of opera glasses yes starting to think he has but unfortunately he made harry and me promise 
 
 well just going to have to break your promise all said ron firmly i mean come on got exams and about that far he held up his hand to show thumb and forefinger almost touching from being chucked out as it is and anyway remember norbert remember aragog have we ever come off better for mixing with any of monster mates 
 
 i know just thatwe promised said hermione in a small voice 
 
 ron smoothed his hair flat again looking preoccupied 
 
 well he sighed hagrid been sacked yet has he hung on this long maybe hang on till the end of term and we have to go near grawp at all 
 
 the castle grounds were gleaming in the sunlight as though freshly painted the cloudless sky smiled at itself in the smoothly sparkling lake the satin green lawns rippled occasionally in a gentle breeze june had arrived but to the this meant only one thing their owls were upon them at last 
 
 their teachers were no longer setting them homework lessons were devoted to revising those topics the teachers thought most likely to come up in the exams the purposeful feverish atmosphere drove nearly everything but the owls from mind though he did wonder occasionally during potions lessons whether lupin had ever told snape that he must continue giving harry ooclumency tuition if he had then snape had ignored lupin as thoroughly as he was now ignoring harry this suited harry very well he was quite busy and tense enough without extra classes with snape and to his relief hermione was much too preoccupied these days to badger him about occlumency she was spending a lot of time muttering to herself and had not laid out any elf clothes for days 
 
 she was not the only person acting oddly as the owls drew steadily nearer ernie macmillan had developed an irritating habit of interrogating people about their revision practices 
 
 how many hours think doing a day he demanded of harry and ron as they queued outside herbology a manic gleam in his eyes 
 
 i dunno said ron a few 
 
 more or less than eight 
 
 less i said ron looking slightly alarmed 
 
 doing eight said ernie puffing out his chest eight or nine getting an hour in before breakfast every day eights my average i can do ten on a good weekend day i did nine and a half on monday not so good on tuesdayonly seven and a quarter then on wednesday 
 
 harry was deeply thankful that professor sprout ushered them into greenhouse three at that point forcing ernie to abandon his recital 
 
 meanwhile draco malfoy had found a different way to induce panic 
 
 of course not what you know he was heard to tell crabbe and goyle loudly outside potions a few days before the exams were to start who you know now been friendly with the head of the wizarding examinations authority for yearsold griselda had her round for dinner and everthing 
 
 do you think true hermione whispered in alarm to harry and ron 
 
 nothing we can do about it if it is said ron gloomily 
 
 i think true said neville quietly from behind them because griselda marchbanks is a friend of my and never mentioned the 
 
 she like neville asked hermione at once is she strict 
 
 bit like gran really said neville in a subdued voice 
 
 knowing her hurt your chances though will it ron told him encouragingly 
 
 oh i think it will make any difference said neville still more miserably always telling professor marchbanks not as good as my dad well you saw what like at st 
 
 neville looked fixedly at the floor harry ron and hermione glanced at each other but know what to say it was the first time neville had acknowledged that they had met at the wizarding hospital 
 
 meanwhile a flourishing trade in aids to concentration mental agility and wakefulness had sprung up among the fifth and harry and ron were much tempted by the bottle of brain elixir offered to them by ravenclaw eddie carmichael who swore it was solely responsible for the nine outstanding owls he had gained the previous summer and was offering a whole pint for a mere twelve galleons ron assured harry he would reimburse him for his half the moment he left hogwarts and got a job but before they could close the deal hermione had confiscated the bottle from carmichael and poured the contents down a toilet 
 
 hermione we wanted to buy that shouted ron 
 
 be stupid she snarled you might as well take harold powdered dragon claw and have done with it 
 
 got powdered dragon claw said ron eagerly 
 
 not any more said hermione i confiscated that too none of these things actually work you know 
 
 dragon claw does work said ron supposed to be incredible really gives your brain a boost you come over all cunning for a few hourshermione let me have a pinch go on it hurt 
 
 this stuff can said hermione grimly had a look at it and actually dried doxy droppings 
 
 this information took the edge off harry and desire for brain stimulants 
 
 they received their examination timetables and details of the procedure for owls during their next transfiguration lesson 
 
 as you can see professor mcgonagall told the class as they copied down the dates and times of their exams from the blackboard your owls are spread over two successive weeks you will sit the theory papers in the mornings and the practice in the afternoons your practical astronomy examination will of course take place at night 
 
 now i must warn you that the most stringent charms have been applied to your examination papers quills are banned from the examination hall as are remembralls detachable cribbing cuffs and ink every year i am afraid to say seems to harbour at least one student who thinks that he or she can get around the wizarding examinations rules i can only hope that it is nobody in gryffindor our newheadmistress professor mcgonagall pronounced the word with the same look on her face that aunt petunia had whenever she was contemplating a particularly stubborn bit of dirt has asked the heads of house to tell their students that cheating will be punished most severelybecause of course your examination results will reflect upon the new regime at the school 
 
 professor mcgonagall gave a tiny sigh harry saw the nostrils of her sharp nose flare 
 
 however that is no reason not to do your very best you have your own futures to think about 
 
 please professor said hermione her hand in the air when will we find out our results 
 
 an owl will be sent to you some time in july said professcr mcgonagall 
 
 excellent said dean thomas in an audible whisper so we have to worry about it till the holidays 
 
 harry imagined sitting in his bedroom in privet drive in six weeks time waiting for his owl results well he thought dully at least he would be sure of one bit of post that summer 
 
 their first examination theory of charms was scheduled for monday morning harry agreed to test hermione after lunch on sunday but regretted it almost at once she was very agitated and kept snatching the book back from him to check that she had got the answer completely right finally hitting him hard on the nose with the sharp edge of achievements in charming 
 
 why you just do it yourself he said firmly handing the book back to her his eyes watering 
 
 meanwhile ron was reading two years worth of charms notes with his fingers in his ears his lips moving soundlessly seamus finnigan was lying flat on his back on the floor reciting the definition of a substantive charm while dean checked it against the standard book of spells grade and parvati and lavender who were practising basic locomotion charms were making their race each other around the edge of the table 
 
 dinner was a subdued affair that night harry and ron did not talk much but ate with gusto having studied hard all day hermione on the other hand kept putting down her knife and fork and diving under the table for her bag from which she would seize a book to check some fact or figure ron was just telling her that she ought to eat a decent meal or she would not sleep that night when her fork slid from her limp fingers and landed with a loud tinkle on her plate 
 
 oh my goodness she said faintly staring into the entrance hall is that them is that the examiners 
 
 harry and ron whipped around on their bench through the doors to the great hall they could see umbridge standing with a small group of witches and wizards umbridge harry was pleased to see looked rather nervous 
 
 shall we go and have a closer look said ron 
 
 harry and hermione nodded and they hastened towards the double doors into the entrance hall slowing down as they stepped over the threshold to walk sedately past the examiners harry thought professor marchbanks must be the tiny stooped witch with a face so lined it looked as though it had been draped in cobwebs umbridge was speaking to her deferentially professor marchbanks seemed to be a little deaf she was answering professor umbridge very loudly considering they were only a foot apart 
 
 journey was fine journey was fine made it plenty of times before she said impatiently now i heard from dumbledore lately she added peering around the hall as though hopeful he might suddenly emerge from a broom cupboard no idea where he is i suppose 
 
 none at all said umbridge shooting a malevolent look at harry ron and hermione who were now dawdling around the foot of the stairs as ron pretended to do up his shoelace but i daresay the ministry of magic will track him down soon enough 
 
 i doubt it shouted tiny professor marchbanks not it dumbledore want to be found i should know examined him personally in transfiguration and charms when he did newts did things with a wand never seen before 
 
 yes well said professor umbridge as harry ron and hermione dragged their feet up the marble staircase as slowly as they dared let me show you to the staff room i daresay like a cup of tea after your journey 
 
 it was an uncomfortable sort of an evening everyone was trying to do some revising but nobody seemed to be getting very far harry went to bed early but then lay awake for what felt like hours he remembered his careers consultation and furious declaration that she would help him become an auror if it was the last thing she did he wished he had expressed a more achievable ambition now that exam time was here he knew he was not the only one lying awake but none of the others in the dormitory spoke and finally one by one they fell asleep 
 
 none of the talked very much at breakfast next day either parvati was practising incantations under her breath while the salt cellar in front of her twitched hermione was rereading achievements in charming so fast that her eyes appeared blurred and neville kept dropping his knife and fork and knocking over the marmalade 
 
 once breakfast was over the fifth and milled around in the entrance hall while the other students went off to lessons then at half past nine they were called forwards class by class to the great hall which had been rearranged exactly as harry had seen it in the pensieve when his father sirius and snape had been taking their owls the four house tables had been removed and replaced instead with many tables for one all facing the end of the hall where professor mcgonagall stood facing them when they were all seated and quiet she said you may begin and turned over an enormous on the desk beside her on which there were also spare quills ink bottles and rolls of parchment 
 
 harry turned over his paper his heart thumping hardthree rows to his right and four seats ahead hermione was already scribblingand lowered his eyes to the first question a give the incantation and b describe the wand movement required to make objects fly 
 
 harry had a fleeting memory of a club soaring high into the air and landing loudly on the thick skull of a troll smiling slightly he bent over the paper and began to write 
 
 well it too bad was it asked hermione anxiously in the entrance hall two hours later still clutching the exam paper not sure i did myself justice on cheering charms i just ran out of time did you put in the for hiccoughs i sure whether i ought to it felt like too muchand on question 
 
 hermione said ron sternly been through this before not going through every exam afterwards bad enough doing them once 
 
 the ate lunch with the rest of the school the four house tables had reappeared for the lunch hour then they trooped off into the small chamber beside the great hall where they were to wait until called for their practical examination as small groups of students were called forwards in alphabetical order those left behind muttered incantations and practised wand movements occasionally poking each other in the back or eye by mistake 
 
 name was called trembling she left the chamber with anthony goldstein gregory goyle and daphne greengrass students who had already been tested did not return afterwards so harry and ron had no idea how hermione had done 
 
 be fine remember she got a hundred and twelve per cent on one of our charms tests said ron 
 
 ten minutes later professor flitwick called parkinson pansypatil padmapatil parvatipotter harry 
 
 good luck said ron quietly harry walked into the great hall clutching his wand so tightly his hand shook 
 
 professor tofty is free potter squeaked professor flitwick who was standing just inside the door he pointed harry towards what looked like the very oldest and baldest examiner who was sitting behind a small table in a far corner a short distance from professor marchbanks who was halfway through testing draco malfoy 
 
 potter is it said professor tofty consulting his notes and peering over his at harry as he approached the famous potter 
 
 out of the corner of his eye harry distinctly saw malfoy throw a scathing look over at him the malfoy had been levitating fell to the floor and smashed harry could not suppress a grin professor tofty smiled back at him encouragingly 
 
 it he said in his quavery old voice no need to be nervous now if i could ask you to take this egg cup and make it do some cartwheels for me 
 
 on the whole harry thought it went rather well his levitation charm was certainly much better than had been though he wished he had not mixed up the incantations for colour change and growth charms so that the rat he was supposed to be turning orange swelled shockingly and was the size of a badger before harry could rectify his mistake he was glad hermione had not been in the hall at the time and neglected to mention it to her afterwards he could tell ron though ron had caused a dinner plate to mutate into a large mushroom and had no idea how it had happened 
 
 there was no time to relax that night they went straight to the common room after dinner and submerged themselves in revision for transfiguration next day harry went to bed with his head buzzing with complex spell models and theories 
 
 he forgot the definition of a switching spell during his written paper next morning but thought his practical could have been a lot worse at least he managed to vanish the whole of his iguana whereas poor hannah abbott lost her head completely at the next table and somehow managed to multiply her ferret into a flock of flamingos causing the examination to be halted for ten minute while the birds were captured and carried out of the hall 
 
 they had their herbology exam on wednesday other than a small bite from a fanged geranium harry felt he had done reasonably well and then on thursday defence against the dark arts here for the first time harry felt sure he had passed he had no problem with any of the written questions and took particular pleasure during the practical examination in performing all the and defensive spells right in front of umbridge who was watching coolly from near the doors into the entrance hall 
 
 oh bravo cried professor tolty who was examining harry again when harry demonstrated a perfect boggart banishing spell very good indeed well i think all potter unless 
 
 he leaned forwards a little 
 
 i heard from my dear friend tiberius ogden that you can produce a patronus for a bonus point 
 
 harry raised his wand looked directly at umbridge and imagined her being sacked 
 
 expecto patronum 
 
 his silver stag erupted from the end of his wand and cantered the length of the hall all of the examiners looked around to watch its progress and when it dissolved into silver mist professor tofty clapped his veined and knotted hands enthusiastically 
 
 excellent he said very well potter you may go 
 
 as harry passed umbridge beside the door their eyes met there was a nasty smile playing around her wide slack mouth but he did not care unless he was very much mistaken and he was not planning on telling anybody in case he was he had just achieved an outstanding owl 
 
 on friday harry and ron had a day off while hermione sat her ancient runes exam and as they had the whole weekend in front of them they permitted themselves a break from revision they stretched and yawned beside the open window through which warm summer air was wafting as they played wizard chess harry could see hagrid in the distance teaching a class on the edge of the forest he was trying to guess what creatures they were examininghe thought it must be unicorns because the boys seemed to be standing back a littlewhen the portrait hole opened and hermione clambered in looking thoroughly 
 
 how were the runes said ron yawning and stretching 
 
 i ehwaz said hermione furiously it means partnership not mixed it up with eihwaz 
 
 ah well said ron lazily only one mistake it still get 
 
 oh shut up said hermione angrily it could be the one mistake that makes the difference between a pass and a fail and more put another niffler in office i know how they got it through that new door but i just walked past there and umbridge is shrieking her head offby the sound of it it tried to take a chunk out of her leg 
 
 good said harry and ron together 
 
 it is not good said hermione hotly she thinks hagrid doing it remember and we do not want hagrid chucked out 
 
 teaching at the moment she blame him said harry gesturing out of the window 
 
 oh so naive sometimes harry you really think umbridge will wait for proof said hermione who seemed determined to be in a towering temper and she swept off towards the girls dormitories banging the door behind her 
 
 such a lovely girl said ron very quietly prodding his queen forward to beat up one of knights 
 
 bad mood persisted for most of the weekend though harry and ron found it quite easy to ignore as they spent most of saturday and sunday revising for potions on monday the exam which harry had been looking forward to leastand which he was sure would be the downfall of his ambitions to become an auror sure enough he found the written paper difficult though he thought he might have got full marks on the question about polyjuice potion he could describe its effects accurately having taken it illegally in his second year 
 
 the afternoon practical was not as dreadful as he had expected it to be with snape absent from the proceedings he found that he was much more relaxed than he usually was while making potions neville who was sitting very near harry also looked happier than harry had ever seen him during a potions class when professor marchbanks said step away from your cauldrons please the examination is over harry corked his sample flask feeling that he might not have achieved a good grade but he had with luck avoided a fail 
 
 only four exams left said parvati patil wearily as they headed back to gryffindor common room 
 
 only said hermione snappishly got arithmancy and probably the toughest subject there is 
 
 nobody was foolish enough to snap back so she was unable to vent her spleen on any of them and was reduced to telling off some for giggling too loudly in the common room 
 
 harry was determined to perform well in care of magical creatures exam so as not to let hagrid down the practical examination took place in the afternoon on the lawn on the edge of the forbidden forest where students were required to correctly identify the knarl hidden among a dozen hedgehogs the trick was to offer them all milk in turn knarls highly suspicious creatures whose quills had many magical properties generally went berserk at what they saw as an attempt to poison them then demonstrate correct handling of a bowtruckle feed and clean out a fire crab without sustaining serious burns and choose from a wide selection of food the diet they would give a sick unicorn 
 
 harry could see hagrid watching anxiously out of his cabin window when examiner a plump little witch this time smiled at him and told him he could leave harry gave hagrid a fleeting before heading back to the castle 
 
 the astronomy theory paper on wednesday morning went well enough harry was not convinced he had got the names of all moons right but was at least confident that none of them was inhabited by mice they had to wait until evening for their practical astronomy the afternoon was devoted instead to divination 
 
 even by low standards in divination the exam went very badly he might as well have tried to see moving pictures on the desktop as in the stubbornly blank crystal ball he lost his head completely during reading saying it looked to him as though professor marchbanks would shortly be meeting a round dark soggy stranger and rounded off the whole fiasco by mixing up the life and head lines on her palm and informing her that she ought to have died the previous tuesday 
 
 well we were always going to fail that one said ron gloomily as they ascended the marble staircase he had just made harry feel rather better by telling him how he had told the examiner in detail about the ugly man with a wart on his nose in his crystal ball only to look up and realise he had been describing his reflection 
 
 we have taken the stupid subject in the first place said harry 
 
 still at least we can give it up now 
 
 yeah said harry no more pretending we care what happens when jupiter and uranus get too friendly 
 
 and from now on i care if my spell die ron just chucking them in the bin where they belong 
 
 harry laughed just as hermione came running up behind them he stopped laughing at once in case it annoyed her 
 
 well i think done all right in arithmancy she said and harry and ron both sighed with relief just time for a quick look over our before dinner then 
 
 when they reached the top of the astronomy tower at eleven they found a perfect night for stargazing cloudless and still the grounds were bathed in silvery moonlight and there was a slight chill in the air each of them set up his or her telescope and when professor marchbanks gave the word proceeded to fill in the blank they had been given 
 
 professors marchbanks and tofty strolled among them watching as they entered the precise positions of the stars and planets they were observing all was quiet except for the rustle of parchment the occasional creak of a telescope as it was adjusted on its stand and the scribbling of many quills half an hour passed then ar hour the little squares of reflected gold light flickering on the ground below started to vanish as lights in the castle windows were extinguished 
 
 as harry completed the constellation orion on his chart however the front doors of the castle opened directly below the parapet where he was standing so that light spilled down the stone steps a little way across the lawn harry glanced down as he made a slight adjustment to the position of his telescope and saw five or six elongated shadows moving over the brightly lit grass before the doors swung shut and the lawn became a sea of darkness once more 
 
 harry put his eye back to his telescope and refocused it now examining venus he looked down at his chart to enter the planet there but something distracted him pausing with his quill suspended over the parchment he squinted down into the shadowy grounds and saw half a dozen figures walking over the lawn if they had not been moving and the moonlight had not been gilding the tops of their heads they would have been indistinguishable from the dark ground on which they walked even at this distance harry had a funny feeling he recognised the walk of the squattest of them who seemed to be leading the group 
 
 he could not think why umbridge would be taking a stroll outside after midnight much less accompanied by five others then somebody coughed behind him and he remembered that he was halfway through an exam he had quite forgotten position jamming his eye to his telescope he found it again and was once more about to enter it on his chart when alert for any odd sound he heard a distant knock which echoed through the deserted grounds followed immediately by the muffled barking of a large dog 
 
 he looked up his heart hammering there were lights on in windows and the people he had observed crossing the lawn were now silhouetted against them the door opened and he distinctly saw six sharply defined figures walk over the threshold the door closed again and there was silence 
 
 harry felt very uneasy he glanced around to see whether ron or hermione had noticed what he had but professor marchbanks came walking behind him at that moment and not wanting to look as though he was sneaking looks at anyone work harry hastily bent over his and pretended to be adding notes to it while really peering over the top of the parapet towards cabin figures were now moving across the cabin windows temporarily blocking the light 
 
 he could feel professor eyes on the back of his neck and pressed his eye again to his telescope staring up at the moon though he had marked its position an hour ago but as professor marchbanks moved on he heard a roar from the distant cabin that echoed through the darkness right to the top of the astronomy tower several of the people around harry ducked out from behind their telescopes and peered instead in the direction of cabin 
 
 professor tofty gave another dry little cough 
 
 try and concentrate now boys and girls he said softly 
 
 most people returned to their telescopes harry looked to his left hermione was gazing transfixed at cabin 
 
 ahemtwenty minutes to go said professor tofty 
 
 hermione jumped and returned at once to her harry looked down at his own and noticed that he had venus as mars he bent to correct it 
 
 there was a loud bang from the grounds several people cried ouch when they poked themselves in the face with the ends of their telescopes as they hastened to see what was going on below 
 
 door had burst open and by the light flooding out of the cabin they saw him quite clearly a massive figure roaring and brandishing his fists surrounded by six people all of whom judging by the tiny threads of red light they were casting in his direction seemed to be attempting to stun him 
 
 no cried hermione 
 
 my dear said professor tofty in a scandalised voice this is an examination 
 
 but nobody was paying the slightest attention to their any more jets of red light were still flying about beside cabin yet somehow they seemed to be bouncing off him he was still upright and still as far as harry could see fighting cries and yells echoed across the grounds a man yelled be reasonable hagrid 
 
 hagrid roared reasonable be damned yeh won take me like this dawlish 
 
 harry could see the tiny outline of fang attempting to defend hagrid leaping repeatedly at the wizards surrounding him until a stunning spell caught him and he fell to the ground hagrid gave a howl of fury lifted the culprit bodily from the ground and threw him the man flew what looked like ten feet and did not get up again hermione gasped both hands over her mouth harry looked round at ron and saw that he too was looking scared none of them had ever seen hagrid in a real temper before 
 
 look squealed parvati who was leaning over the parapet and pointing to the foot of the castle where the front doors had opened again more light was spilling out on to the dark lawn and a single long black shadow was now rippling across the lawn 
 
 now really said professor tofty anxiously only sixteen minutes left you know 
 
 but nobody paid him the slightest attention they were watching the person now sprinting towards the battle beside cabin 
 
 how dare you the figure shouted as she ran how dare you 
 
 mcgonagall whispered hermione 
 
 leave him alone say said professor voice through the darkness on what grounds are you attacking him he has done nothing nothing to warrant such 
 
 hermione parvati and lavender all screamed the figures around the cabin had shot no fewer than four stunners at professor mcgonagall halfway between cabin and castle the red beams collided with her for a moment she looked luminous and glowed an eerie red then she lifted right off her feet landed hard on her back and moved no more 
 
 galloping gargoyles shouted professor tofty who also seemed to have forgotten the exam completely not so much as a warning outrageous behaviour 
 
 cowards bellowed hagrid his voice carried clearly to the top of the tower and several lights flickered back on inside the castle ruddy cowards have some o that an that 
 
 oh my gasped hermione 
 
 hagrid took two massive swipes at his closest attackers judging by their immediate collapse they had been knocked cold harry saw hagrid double over and thought he had finally been overcome by a spell but on the contrary next moment hagrid was standing again with what appeared to be a sack on his backthen harry realised that bangs limp body was draped around his shoulders 
 
 get him get him screamed umbridge but her remaining helper seemed highly reluctant to go within reach of fists indeed he was backing away so fast he tripped over one of his unconscious colleagues and fell over hagrid had turned and begun to run with fang still hung around his neck umbridge sent one last stunning spell after him but it missed and hagrid running towards the distant gates disappeared into the darkness 
 
 there was a long quivering silence as everybody gazed into the grounds then professor voice said feebly um five minutes to go everybody 
 
 though he had only filled in of his chart harry was desperate for the exam to end when it came at last he ron and hermione forced their telescopes haphazardly back into their holders and dashed back down the spiral staircase none of the students were going to bed they were all talking loudly and excitedly at the foot of the stairs about what they had witnessed 
 
 that evil woman gasped hermione who seemed to be having difficulty talking due to rage trying to sneak up on hagrid in the dead of night 
 
 she clearly wanted to avoid another scene like said ernie macmillan sagely squeezing over to join them 
 
 hagrid did well he said ron who looked more alarmed than impressed how come all the spells bounced off him 
 
 be his giant blood said hermione shakily its very hard to stun a giant like trolls really tough but poor professor mcgonagall four stunners straight in the chest and not exactly young is she 
 
 dreadful dreadful said ernie shaking his head pompously well off to bed night all 
 
 people around them were drifting away still talking excitedly about what they had just seen 
 
 at least they get to take hagrid off to azkaban said ron i spect gone to join dumbledore he 
 
 i suppose so said hermione who looked tearful oh this is awful i really thought dumbledore would be back before long but now lost hagrid too 
 
 they traipsed back to the gryffindor common room to find it full the commotion out in the grounds had woken several people who had hastened to rouse their friends seamus and dean who had arrived ahead of harry ron and hermione were now telling everyone what they had seen and heard from the top of the astronomy tower 
 
 but why sack hagrid now asked angelina johnson shaking her head not like trelawney been teaching much better than usual this year 
 
 urnbridge hates said hermione bitterly flopping down into an armchair she was always going to try and get hagrid out 
 
 and she thought hagrid was putting nifflers in her office piped up katie bell 
 
 oh blimey said lee jordan covering his mouth me been putting the nifflers in her office fred and george left me a couple been levitating them in through her window 
 
 have sacked him anyway said dean he was too close to dumbledore 
 
 true said harry sinking into an armchair beside 
 
 i just hope professor all right said lavender tearfully 
 
 they carried her back up to the castle we watched through the dormitory window said colin creevey she look very well 
 
 madam pomfrey will sort her out said alicia spinnet firmly never failed yet 
 
 it was nearly four in the morning before the common room cleared harry felt wide awake the image of hagrid sprinting away into the dark was haunting him he was so angry with umbridge he could not think of a punishment bad enough for her though suggestion of having her fed to a box of starving skrewts had its merits he fell asleep contemplating hideous revenges and arose from bed three hours later feeling distinctly unrested 
 
 their final exam history of magic was not to take place until that afternoon harry would very much have liked to go back to bed after breakfast but he had been counting on the morning for a spot of revision so instead he sat with his head in his hands by the window trying hard not to doze off as he read through some of the stack of notes that hermione had lent him 
 
 the entered the great hall at two and took their places in front of their examination papers harry felt exhausted he just wanted this to be over so that he could go and sleep then tomorrow he and ron were going to go down to the quidditch pitchhe was going to have a fly on broomand savour their freedom from revision 
 
 turn over your papers said professor marchbanks from the front of the hall flicking over the giant you may begin 
 
 harry stared fixedly at the first question it was several seconds before it occurred to him that he had not taken in a word of it there was a wasp buzzing distractingly against one of the high windows slowly tortuously he at last began to write an answer 
 
 he was finding it very difficult to remember names and kept confusing dates he simply skipped question four in your opinion did wand legislation contribute to or lead to better control of goblin riots of the eighteenth century thinking that he would go back to it if he had time at the end he had a stab at question five how was the statute of secrecy breached in and what measures were introduced to prevent a recurrence but had a nagging suspicion that he had missed several important points he had a feeling vampires had come into the story somewhere 
 
 he looked ahead for a question he could definitely answer and his eyes alighted upon number ten describe the circumstances that led to the formation of the international confederation of wizards and explain why the warlocks of liechtenstein refused to join 
 
 i know this harry thought though his brain felt torpid and slack he could visualise a heading in handwriting the formation of the international confederation of wizards he had read those notes only this morning 
 
 he began to write looking up now and again to check the large on the desk beside professor marchbanks he was sitting right behind parvati patil whose long dark hair fell below the back of her chair once or twice he found himself staring at the tiny golden lights that glistened in it when she moved her head slightly and had to give his own head a little shake to clear it 
 
 the first supreme mugwump of the international confederation of wizards was pierre bonaccord but his appointment was contested by the wizarding community of liechtenstein because 
 
 all around harry quills were scratching on parchment like scurrying burrowing rats the sun was very hot on the back of his head what was it that bonaccord had done to offend the wizards of liechtenstein harry had a feeling it had something to do with trolls he gazed blankly at the back of head again if he could only perform legilimency and open a window in the back of her head and see what it was about trolls that had caused the breach between pierre bonaccord and liechtenstein 
 
 harry closed his eyes and buried his face in his hands so that the glowing red of his eyelids grew dark and cool bonaccord had wanted to stop and give the trolls rights but liechtenstein was having problems with a tribe of particularly vicious mountain trolls that was it 
 
 he opened his eyes they stung and watered at the sight of the blazing white parchment slowly he wrote two lines about the trolls then read through what he had done so far it did not seem very informative or detailed yet he was sure notes on the confederation had gone on for pages and pages 
 
 he closed his eyes again trying to see them trying to remember the confederation had met for the first time in france yes he had written that already 
 
 goblins had tried to attend and been ousted he had written that too 
 
 and nobody from liechtenstein had wanted to come 
 
 think he told himself his face in his hands while all around him quills scratched out answers and the sand trickled through the at the front 
 
 he was walking along the cool dark corridor to the department of mysteries again walking with a firm and purposeful tread breaking occasionally into a run determined to reach his destination at last the black door swung open for him as usual and here he was in the circular room with its many doors 
 
 straight across the stone floor and through the second door patches of dancing light on the walls and floor and that odd mechanical clicking but no time to explore he must hurry 
 
 he jogged the last few feet to the third door which swung open just like the others 
 
 once again he was in the room full of shelves and glass spheres his heart was beating very fast now he was going to get there this time when he reached number he turned left and hurried along the aisle between two rows 
 
 but there was a shape on the floor at the very end a black shape moving on the floor like a wounded animal stomach contracted with fear with excitement 
 
 a voice issued from his own mouth a high cold voice empty of any human kindness 
 
 take it for me lift it down now i cannot touch it but you can 
 
 the black shape on the floor shifted a little harry saw a white hand clutching a wand rise at the end of his own arm heard the high cold voice say crucio 
 
 the man on the floor let out a scream of pain attempted to stand but fell back writhing harry was laughing he raised his wand the curse lifted and the figure groaned and became motionless 
 
 lord voldemort is waiting 
 
 very slowly his arms trembling the man on the ground raised his shoulders a few inches and lifted his head his face was bloodstained and gaunt twisted in pain yet rigid with defiance 
 
 have to kill me whispered sirius 
 
 undoubtedly i shall in the end said the cold voice but you will fetch it for me first black you think you have felt pain thus far think again we have hours ahead of us and nobody to hear you scream 
 
 but somebody screamed as voldemort lowered his wand again somebody yelled and fell sideways off a hot desk on to the cold stone floor harry awoke as he hit the ground still yelling his scar on fire as the great hall erupted all around him 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix 
 

lionfish nov chapter the battle of hogwartscontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 the enchanted ceiling of the great hall was dark and scattered with stars and below it the four long house tables were lined with disheveled students some in traveling cloaks others in dressing gowns here and there shone the pearly white figures of the school ghosts every eye living and dead was fixed upon professor mcgonagall who was speaking from the raised platform at the top of the hall behind her stood the remaining teaches including the palomino centaur firenze and the members of the order of the phoenix who had arrived to fight 
 
 evacuation will be overseen by mr filch and madame pomfrey prefects when i give the word you will organize your house and take your charges in orderly fashion to the evacuation point 
 
 many of the students looked petrified however as harry skirted the walls scanning the gryffindor table for ron and hermione ernie macmillan stood up at the hufflepuff table and shouted and what if we want to stay and fight 
 
 there was a smattering of applause 
 
 if you are of age you may stay said professor mcgonagall 
 
 what about our things called a girl at the ravenclaw table our trunks our owls 
 
 we have no time to collect possessions said professor mcgonagall the important thing is to get you out of here safely 
 
 wheres professor snape shouted a girl from the slytherin table 
 
 he has to use the common phrase done a bunk replied professor mcgonagall and a great cheer erupted from the gryffindors hufflepuffs and ravenclaws 
 
 harry moved up the hall alongside the gryffindor table still looking for ron and hermione as he passed faces turned in his direction and a great deal of whispering broke out in his wake 
 
 we have already placed protection around the castle professor mcgonagall was saying but it is unlikely to hold for very long unless we reinforce it i must ask you therefore to move quickly and calmly and do as your prefects c 
 
 but her final words were drowned as a different voice echoed throughout the hall it was high cold and clear there was no telling from where it came it seemed to issue from the walls themselves like the monster it had once commanded it might have lain dormant there for centuries 
 
 i know that you are preparing to fight there were screams amongst the students some of whom clutched each other looking around in terror for the source of the sound your efforts are futile you cannot fight me i do not want to kill you i have great respect for the teachers of hogwarts i do not want to spill magical blood 
 
 there was silence in the hall now the kind of silence that presses against the eardrums that seems too huge to be contained by walls 
 
 give me harry potter said voldemorts voice and they shall not be harmed give me harry potter and i shall leave the school untouched give me harry potter and you will be rewarded 
 
 you have until midnight 
 
 the silence swallowed them all again every head turned every eye in the place seemed to have found harry to hold him forever in the glare of thousands of invisible beams then a figure rose from the slytherin table and he recognized pansy parkinson as she raised a shaking arm and screamed but hes there potters there someone grab him 
 
 before harry could speak there was a massive movement the gryffindors in front of him had risen and stood facing not harry but the slytherins then the hufflepuffs stood and almost at the same moment the ravenclaws all of them with their backs to harry all of them looking toward pansy instead and harry awestruck and overwhelmed saw wands emerging everywhere pulled from beneath cloaks and from under sleeves 
 
 thank you miss parkinson said professor mcgonagall in a clipped voice you will leave the hall first with mr filch if the rest of your house could follow 
 
 harry heard the grinding of the benches and then the sound of the slytherins trooping out on the other side of the hall 
 
 ravenclaws follow on cried professor mcgonagall 
 
 slowly the four tables emptied the slytherin table was completely deserted but a number of older ravenclaws remained seated while their fellows filed out even more hufflepuffs stayed behind and half of gryffindor remained in their seats necessitating professor mcgonagalls descent from the teachers platform to chivvy the underage on their way 
 
 absolutely not creevey go and you peakes 
 
 harry hurried over to the weasleys all sitting together at the gryffindor table 
 
 where are ron and hermione 
 
 havent you found began mr weasley looking worried 
 
 but he broke off as kingsley had stepped forward on the raised platform to address those who had remained behind 
 
 weve only got half an half an hour until midnight so we need to act fast a battle plan has been agreed between the teachers of hogwarts and the order of the phoenix professors flitwick sprout and mcgonagall are going to take groups of fighters up to the three highest towers c ravenclaw astronomy and gryffindor c where theyll have good overview excellent positions from which to work spells meanwhile remus c he indicated lupin c arthur c he pointed toward mr weasley sitting at the gryffindor table c and i will take groups into the grounds well need somebody to organize defense of the entrances or the passageways into the school c 
 
 sounds like a job for us called fred indicating himself and george and kingsley nodded his approval 
 
 all right leaders up here and well divide up the troops 
 
 potter said professor mcgonagall hurrying up to him as students flooded the platform jostling for position receiving instructions arent you supposed to be looking for something 
 
 what oh said harry oh yeah 
 
 he had almost forgotten about the horcrux almost forgotten that the battle was being fought so that he could search for it the inexplicable absence of ron and hermione had momentarily driven every other thought from his mind 
 
 then go potter go 
 
 right c yeah c 
 
 he sensed eyes following him as he ran out of the great hall again into the entrance hall still crowded with evacuating students he allowed himself to be swept up the marble staircase with them but at the top he hurried off along a deserted corridor fear and panic were clouding his thought processes he tried to calm himself to concentrate on finding the horcrux but his thoughts buzzed as frantically and fruitlessly as wasps trapped beneath a glass without ron and hermione to help him he could not seem to marshal his ideas he slowed down coming to a halt halfway along a passage where he sat down on the plinth of a departed statue and pulled the marauders map out of the pouch around his neck he could not see rons of hermiones names anywhere on it though the density of the crowd of dots now making its way to the room of requirement might he thought be concealing them he put the map away pressed his hands over his face and closed his eyes trying to concentrate 
 
 voldemort thought id go to ravenclaw tower 
 
 there it was a solid fact the place to start voldemort had stationed alecto carrow in the ravenclaw common room and there could be only one explanation voldemort feared that harry already knew his horcrux was connected to that house 
 
 but the only object anyone seemed to associate with ravenclaw was the lost diadem and how could the horcrux be the diadem how was it possible that voldemort the slytherin had found the diadem that had eluded generations of ravenclaws who could have told him where to look when nobody had seen the diadem in living memory 
 
 in living memory 
 
 beneath his fingers harrys eyes flew open again he leapt up from the plinth and tore back the way he had come now in pursuit of his one last hope the sound of hundreds of people marching toward the room of requirement grew louder and louder as he returned to the marble stairs prefects were shouting instructions trying to keep track of the students in their own houses there was much pushing and shouting harry saw zacharias smith bowling over first years to get to the front of the queue here and there younger students were in tears while older ones called desperately for friends or siblings 
 
 harry caught sight of a pearly white figure drifting across the entrance hall below and yelled as loudly as he could over the clamor 
 
 nick nick i need to talk to you 
 
 he forced his way back through the tide of students finally reaching the bottom of the stairs where nearly headless nick ghost of gryffindor tower stood waiting for him 
 
 harry my dear boy 
 
 nick made to grasp harrys hands with both of his own harry felt as though they had been thrust into icy water 
 
 nick youve got to help me whos the ghost of ravenclaw tower 
 
 nearly headless nick looked surprised and a little offended 
 
 the gray lady of course but if it is ghostly services you require 
 
 its got to be her c dyou know where she is 
 
 lets see 
 
 nicks head wobbled a little on his ruff as he turned hither and thither peering over the heads of the swarming students 
 
 thats her over there harry the young woman with the long hair 
 
 harry looked in the direction of nicks transparent pointing finger and saw a tall ghost who caught sight of harry looking at her raised her eyebrows and drifted away through a solid wall 
 
 harry ran after her once through the door of the corridor into which she had disappeared he saw her at the very end of the passage still gliding smoothly away from him 
 
 hey c wait c come back 
 
 she consented to pause floating a few inches from the ground harry supposed that she was beautiful with her hair and cloak but she also looked haughty and proud close in he recognized her as a ghost he had passed several times in the corridor but to whom he had never spoken 
 
 youre the gray lady 
 
 she nodded but did not speak 
 
 the ghost of ravenclaw tower 
 
 that is correct 
 
 her tone was not encouraging 
 
 please i need some help i need to know anything you can tell me about the lost diadem 
 
 a cold smile curved her lips 
 
 i am afraid she said turning to leave that i cannot help you 
 
 wait 
 
 he had not meant to shout but anger and panic were threatening to overwhelm him he glanced at his watch as she hovered in front of him it was a quarter to midnight 
 
 this is urgent he said fiercely if that diadems at hogwarts ive got to find it fast 
 
 you are hardly the first student to covet the diadem she said disdainfully generations of students have badgered me c 
 
 this isnt about trying to get better marks harry shouted at her its about voldemort c defeating voldemort c or arent you interested in that 
 
 she could not blush but her transparent cheeks became more opaque and her voice was heated as she replied of course i c how dare you suggest c 
 
 well help me then 
 
 her composure was slipping 
 
 it c it is not a question of c she stammered my mothers diadem c 
 
 your mothers 
 
 she looked angry with herself 
 
 when i lived she said stiffly i was helena ravenclaw 
 
 youre her daughter but then you must know what happed to it 
 
 while the diadem bestows wisdom she said with an obvious effort to pull herself together i doubt that it would greatly increase you chances of defeating the wizard who calls himself lord c 
 
 havent i told you im not interested in wearing it harry said fiercely theres no time to explain c but if you care about hogwarts if you want to see voldemort finished youve got to tell me anything you know about the diadem 
 
 she remained quite still floating in midair staring down at him and a sense of hopelessness engulfed harry of course if she had known anything she would have told flitwick of dumbledore who had surely asked her the same question he had shaken his head and made to turn away when she spoke in a low voice 
 
 i stole the diadem from my mother 
 
 you c you did what 
 
 i stole the diadem repeated helena ravenclaw in a whisper i sought to make myself cleverer more important than my mother i ran away with it 
 
 he did not know how he had managed to gain her confidence and did not ask he simply listened hard as she went on 
 
 my mother they say never admitted that the diadem was gone but pretended that she had it still she concealed her loss my dreadful betrayal even from the other founders of hogwarts 
 
 then my mother fell ill c fatally ill in spite of my perfidy she was desperate to see me one more time she sent a man who had long loved me though i spurned his advances to find me she knew that he would not rest until he had done so 
 
 harry waited she drew a deep breath and threw back her head 
 
 he tracked me to the forest where i was hiding when i refused to return with him he became violent the baron was always a man furious at my refusal jealous of my freedom he stabbed me 
 
 the baron you mean 
 
 the bloody baron yes said the gray lady and she lifted aside the cloak she wore to reveal a single dark wound in her white chest 
 
 when he saw what he had done he was overcome with remorse he took the weapon that had claimed my life and used it to kill himself all these centuries later he wears his chains as an act of penitence as he should she added bitterly 
 
 and c and the diadem 
 
 it remained where i had hidden it when i heard the baron blundering through the forest toward me concealed inside a hollow tree 
 
 a hollow tree repeated harry what tree where was this 
 
 a forest in albania a lonely place i thought was far beyond my mothers reach 
 
 albania repeated harry sense was emerging miraculously from confusion and now he understood why she was telling him what she had denied dumbledore and flitwick youve already told someone this story havent you another student 
 
 she closed her eyes and nodded 
 
 i had no idea he was flattering he seemed to understand to sympathize 
 
 yes harry thought tom riddle would certainly have understood helena ravenclaws desire to possess fabulous objects to which she had little right 
 
 well you werent the first person riddle wormed things out of harry muttered he could be charming when he wanted 
 
 so voldemort had managed to wheedle the location of the lost diadem out of the gray lady he had traveled to that forest and retrieved the diadem from its hiding place perhaps as soon as he left hogwarts before he even started work at borgin and burkes 
 
 and wouldnt those secluded albanian woods have seemed an excellent refuge when so much later voldemort and needed a place to lie low undisturbed for ten long years 
 
 but the diadem once it became his precious horcrux had not been left in that lowly tree no the diadem had been returned secretly to its true home and voldemort must have put it there c 
 
 c the night he asked for a job said harry finishing his thought 
 
 i beg your pardon 
 
 he hid the diadem in the castle the night he asked dumbledore to let him teach said harry saying it out loud enabled him to make sense of it all he mustve hidden the diadem on his way up to or down from dumbledores office but it was well worth trying to get the job c then he mightve got the chance to nick gryffindors sword as well c thank you thanks 
 
 harry left her floating there looking utterly bewildered as he rounded the corner back into the entrance hall he checked his watch it was five minutes until midnight and though he now knew what the last horcrux was he was no closer to discovering where it was 
 
 generations of students had failed to find the diadem that suggested that it was not in ravenclaw tower c but if not there where what hiding place had tom riddle discovered inside hogwarts castle that he believed would remain secret forever 
 
 lost in desperate speculation harry turned a corner but he had taken only a few steps down the new corridor when the window to his left broke open with a deafening shattering crash as he leapt aside a gigantic body flew in through the window and hit the opposite wall 
 
 something large and furry detached itself whimpering from the new arrival and flung itself at harry 
 
 hagrid harry bellowed fighting off fang the boarhounds attentions as the enormous bearded figure clambered to his feet what the c 
 
 harry yer here yer here 
 
 hagrid stooped down bestowed upon harry a cursory and hug then ran back to the shattered window 
 
 good boy grawpy he bellowed through the hole in the window ill se yer in a moment theres a good lad 
 
 beyond hagrid out in the dark night harry saw bursts of light in the distance and heard a weird keening scream he looked down at his watch it was midnight the battle had begun 
 
 blimey harry panted hagrid this is it eh time ter fight 
 
 hagrid where have you come from 
 
 heard from up in our cave said hagrid grimly voice carried didnt it yet got till midnight ter gimme potter knew yeh mus be here knew that mus be happenin get down fang so we come ter join in me an grawpy an fang smashed our way through the boundary by the forest grawpy was carryin us fang an me told him ter let me down at the castle so he shoved me through the window bless him not exactly what i meant bu c wheres ron an hermione 
 
 that said harry is a really good question come on 
 
 they hurried together along the corridor fang lolloping beside them harry could hear movement through the corridors all around running footsteps shouts through the windows he could see more flashes of light in the dark grounds 
 
 wherere we goin puffed hagrid pounding along at harrys heels making the floorboards quake 
 
 i dunno exactly said harry making another random turn but ron and hermione must be around here somewhere 
 
 the first casualties of the battle were already strewn across the passage ahead the two stone gargoyles that usually guarded the entrance to the staffroom had been smashed apart by a jinx that had sailed through another broken window their remains stirred feebly on the floor and as harry leapt over one of their disembodied heads it moaned faintly oh dont mind me ill just be here and crumble 
 
 its ugly stone face made harry think suddenly of the marble bust of rowena ravenclaw at xenophiliuss house wearing that mad headdress c and then of the statue in ravenclaw tower with the stone diadem upon her white curls 
 
 and as he reached the end of the passage the memory of a third stone effigy came back to him that of an ugly old warlock onto whose head harry himself had placed a wig and a battered old hat the shock shot through harry with the heat of firewhisky and he nearly stumbled 
 
 he knew at least where the horcrux sat waiting for him 
 
 tom riddle who confided in no one and operated alone might have been arrogant enough to assume that he and only he had penetrated the deepest mysteries of hogwarts castle of course dumbledore and flitwick those model pupils had never set foot in that particular place but he harry had strayed off the beaten track in his time at school c here at least was a secret area he and voldemort knew that dumbledore had never discovered c 
 
 he was roused by professor sprout who was thundering past followed by neville and half a dozen others all of them wearing earmuffs and carrying what appeared to be large potted plants 
 
 mandrakes neville bellowed at harry over his shoulder as he ran going to lob them over the walls c they wont like this 
 
 harry knew now where to go he sped off with hagrid and fang galloping behind him they passed portrait after portrait and the painted figures raced alongside them wizards and witches in ruffs and breeches in armor and cloaks cramming themselves into each others canvases screaming news from other parts of the castle as they reached the end of this corridor the whole castle shook and harry knew as a gigantic vase blew off its plinth with explosive force that it was in the grip of enchantments more sinister than those of the teachers and the order 
 
 its all righ fang c its all righ yelled hagrid but the great boarhound had taken flight as slivers of china flew like shrapnel through the air and hagrid pounded off after the terrified dog leaving harry alone 
 
 he forged on through the trembling passages his wand at the ready and for the length of one corridor the little painted knight sir cadrigan rushed from painting to painting beside him clanking along in his armor screaming encouragement his fat little pony cantering behind him 
 
 braggarts and rogues dogs and scoundrels drive them out harry potter see them off 
 
 harry hurtled around a corner and found fred and a small knot of students including lee jordan and hannah abbott standing beside another empty plinth whose statue had concealed a secret passageway their wands were drawn and they were listening at the concealed hole 
 
 nice night for it fred shouted as the castle quaked again and harry sprinted by elated and terrified in equal measure along yet another corridor he dashed and then there were owls everywhere and mrs norris was hissing and trying to bat them with her paws no doubt to return them to their proper place 
 
 potter 
 
 aberforth dumbledore stood blocking the corridor ahead his wand held ready 
 
 ive had hundreds of kids thundering through my pub potter 
 
 i know were evacuating harry said voldemorts c 
 
 c attacking because they havent handed you over yeah said aberforth im not deaf the whole of hogsmeade heard him and it never occurred to any of you to keep a few slytherins hostage there are kids of death eaters youve just sent to safety wouldnt it have been a bit smarter to keep em here 
 
 it wouldnt stop voldemort said harry and your brother would never have done it 
 
 aberforth grunted and tore away in the opposite direction 
 
 your brother would never have done it well it was the truth harry thought as he ran on again dumbledore who had defended snape for so long would never have held students ransom 
 
 and then he skidded around a final corner and with a yell of mingled relief and fury he saw them ron and hermione both with their arms full of large curved dirty yellow objects ron with a broomstick under his arms 
 
 where the hell have you been harry shouted 
 
 chamber of secrets said ron 
 
 chamber c what said harry coming to an unsteady halt before them 
 
 it was ron all rons idea said hermione breathlessly wasnt it absolutely brilliant there we were after we left and i said to ron even if we find the other one how are we going to get rid of it we still hadnt got rid of the cup and then he thought of it the basilisk 
 
 what the c 
 
 something to get rid of horcruxes said ron simply 
 
 harrys eyes dropped to the objects clutched in ron and hermiones arms great curved fangs torn he now realized from the skull of a dead basilisk 
 
 but how did you get in there he asked staring from the fangs to ron you need to speak parseltongue 
 
 he did whispered hermione show him ron 
 
 ron made a horrible strangled hissing noise 
 
 its what you did to open the locket he told harry apologetically i had to have a few goes to get it right but he shrugged modestly we got there in the end 
 
 he was amazing said hermione amazing 
 
 so harry was struggling to keep up so 
 
 so were another horcrux down said ron and from under his jacket he pulled the mangled remains of hufflepuffs cup hermione stabbed it thought she should she hasnt had the pleasure yet 
 
 genius yelled harry 
 
 it was nothing said ron though he looked delighted with himself so whats new with you 
 
 as he said it there was an explosion from overhead all three of them looked up as dust fell from the ceiling and they heard a distant scream 
 
 i know what the diadem looks like and i know where it is said harry talking fast he hid it exactly where i had my old potions book where everyones been hiding stuff for centuries he thought he was the only one to find it come on 
 
 as the walls trembled again he led the other two back through the concealed entrance and down the staircase into the room of requirement it was empty except for three women ginny tonks and an elderly witch wearing a hat whom harry recognized immediately as nevilles grandmother 
 
 ah potter she said crisply as if she had been waiting for him you can tell us whats going on 
 
 is everyone okay said ginny and tonks together 
 
 s far as we know said harry are there still people in the passage to the hogs head 
 
 he knew that the room would not be able to transform while there were still users inside it 
 
 i was the last to come through said mrs longbottom i sealed it i think it unwise to leave it open now aberforth has left his pub have you seen my grandson 
 
 hes fighting said harry 
 
 naturally said the old lady proudly excuse me i must go and assist him 
 
 with surprising speed she trotted off toward the stone steps 
 
 harry looked at tonks 
 
 i thought you were supposed to be with teddy at your mothers 
 
 i couldnt stand not knowing c tonks looked anguished shell look after him c have you seen remus 
 
 he was planning to lead a group of fighters into the grounds c 
 
 without another word tonks sped off 
 
 ginny said harry im sorry but we need you to leave too just for a bit then you can come back in 
 
 ginny looked simply delighted to leave her sanctuary 
 
 and then you can come back in he shouted after her as she ran up the steps after tonks youve got to come back in 
 
 hang on a moment said ron sharply weve forgotten someone 
 
 who asked hermione 
 
 the theyll all be down in the kitchen wont they 
 
 you mean we ought to get them fighting asked harry 
 
 no said ron seriously i mean we should tell them to get out we dont want anymore dobbies do we we cant order them to die for us c 
 
 there was a clatter as the basilisk fangs cascaded out of hermiones arms running at ron she flung them around his neck and kissed him full on the mouth ron threw away the fangs and broomstick he was holding and responded with such enthusiasm that he lifted hermione off her feet 
 
 is this the moment harry asked weakly and when nothing happened except that ron and hermione gripped each other still more firmly and swayed on the spot he raised his voice oi theres a war going on here 
 
 ron and hermione broke apart their arms still around each other 
 
 i know mate said ron who looked as though he had recently been hit on the back of the head with a bludger so its now or never isnt it 
 
 never mind that what about the horcrux harry shouted dyou think you could just c just hold it in until weve got the diadem 
 
 yeah c right c sorry c said ron and he and hermione set about gathering up fangs both pink in the face 
 
 it was clear as the three of them stepped back into the corridor upstairs that in the minutes that they had spent in the room of requirement the situation within the castle had deteriorated severely the walls and ceiling were shaking worse than ever dust filled the air and through the nearest window harry saw bursts of green and red light so close to the foot of the castle that he knew the death eaters must be very near to entering the place looking down harry saw grawp the giant meandering past swinging what looked like a stone gargoyle torn from the roof and roaring his displeasure 
 
 lets hope he steps on some of them said ron as more screams echoed from close by 
 
 as long as its not any of our lot said a voice harry turned and saw ginny and tonks both with their wands drawn at the next window which was missing several panes even as he watched ginny sent a jinx into a crowd of fighters below 
 
 good girl roared a figure running through the dust toward them and harry saw aberforth again his gray hair flying as he led a small group of students past they look like they might be breaching the north battlements theyve brought giants of their own 
 
 have you seen remus tonks called after him 
 
 he was dueling dolohov shouted aberforth havent seen him since 
 
 tonks said ginny tonks im sure hes okay c 
 
 but tonks had run off into the dust after aberforth 
 
 ginny turned helpless to harry ron and hermione 
 
 theyll be all right said harry though he knew they were empty words ginny well be back in a moment just keep out of the way keep safe c come on he said to ron and hermione and they ran back to the stretch of wall beyond which the room of requirement was waiting to do the bidding of the next entrant 
 
 i need the place where everything is hidden harry begged of it inside his head and the door materialized on their third run past 
 
 the furor of the battle died the moment they crossed the threshold and closed the door behind them all was silent they were in a place the size of a cathedral with the appearance of a city its towering walls built of objects hidden by thousands of students 
 
 and he never realized anyone could get in said ron his voice echoing in the silence 
 
 he thought he was the only one said harry too bad for him ive had to hide stuff in my time this way he added i think its down here 
 
 they sped off up adjacent aisles harry could hear the others footsteps echoing through the towering piles of junk of bottles hats crates chairs books weapons broomsticks bats 
 
 somewhere near here harry muttered to himself somewhere somewhere 
 
 deeper and deeper into the labyrinth he went looking for objects he recognized from his one previous trip into the room his breath was loud in his ears and then his very soul seemed to shiver there it was right ahead the blistered old cupboard in which he had hidden his old potions book and on top of it the pockmarked stone warlock wearing a dusty old wig and what looked like an ancient discolored tiara 
 
 he had already stretched out his hand though he remained few feet away when a voice behind him said hold it potter 
 
 he skidded to a halt and turned around crabbe and goyle were standing behind him shoulder to shoulder wands pointing right at harry through the small space between their jeering faces he saw draco malfoy 
 
 thats my wand youre holding potter said malfoy pointing his own through the gap between crabbe and goyle 
 
 not anymore panted harry tightening his grip on the hawthorn wand winners keepers malfoy whos lent you theirs 
 
 my mother said draco 
 
 harry laughed though there was nothing very humorous about the situation he could not hear ron or hermione anymore they seemed to have run out of earshot searching for the diadem 
 
 so how come you three arent with voldemort asked harry 
 
 were gonna be rewarded said crabbe his voice was surprisingly soft for such an enormous person harry had hardly ever heard him speak before crabbe was speaking like a small child promised a large bag of sweets we ung back potter we decided not to go decided to bring you to im 
 
 good plan said harry in mock admiration he could not believe that he was this close and was going to be thwarted by malfoy crabbe and goyle he began edging slowly backward toward the place where the horcrux sat lopsided upon the bust if he could just get his hands on it before the fight broke out 
 
 so how did you get in here he asked trying to distract them 
 
 i virtually lived in the room of hidden things all last year said malfoy his voice brittle i know how to get in 
 
 we was hiding in the corridor outside grunted goyle we can do disslusion charms now and then his face split into a gormless grin you turned up right in front of us and said you was looking for a whats a 
 
 harry rons voice echoed suddenly from the other side of the wall to harrys right are you talking to someone 
 
 with a whiplike movement crabbe pointed his wand at the fifty foot mountain of old furniture of broken trunks of old books and robes and unidentifiable junk and shouted descendo 
 
 the wall began to totter then the top third crumbled into the aisle next door where ron stood 
 
 ron harry bellowed as somewhere out of sight hermione screamed and harry heard innumerable objects crashing to the floor on the other side of the destabilized wall he pointed his wand at the rampart cried finite and it steadied 
 
 no shouted malfoy staying crabbes arm as the latter made to repeat his spell if you wreck the room you might bury this diadem thing 
 
 whats that matter said crabbe tugging himself free its potter the dark lord wants who cares about a 
 
 potter came in here to get it said malfoy with impatience at the of his colleagues so that must mean c 
 
 must mean crabbe turned on malfoy with undisguised ferocity who cares what you think i dont take your orders no more draco you an your dad are finished 
 
 harry shouted ron again from the other side of the junk wad whats going on 
 
 harry mimicked crabbe whats going on c no potter crucio 
 
 harry had lunged for the tiara crabbes curse missed him but hit the stone bust which flew into the air the diadem soared upward and then dropped out of sight in the mass of objects on which the bust had rested 
 
 stop malfoy shouted at crabbe his voice echoing through the enormous room the dark lord wants him alive c 
 
 so im not killing him am i yelled crabbe throwing off malfoys restraining arm but if i can i will the dark lord wants him dead anyway whats the diff c 
 
 a jet of scarlet light shot past harry by inches hermione had run around the corner behind him and sent a stunning spell straight at crabbes head it only missed because malfoy pulled him out of the way 
 
 its that mudblood avada kedavra 
 
 harry saw hermione dive aside and his fury that crabbe had aimed to kill wiped all else from his mind he shot a stunning spell at crabbe who lurched out of the way knocking malfoys wand out of his hand it rolled out of sight beneath a mountain of broken furniture and bones 
 
 dont kill him dont kill him malfoy yelled at crabbe and goyle who were both aiming at harry their split seconds hesitation was all harry needed 
 
 expelliarmus 
 
 goyles wand flew out of his hand and disappeared into the bulwark of objects beside him goyle leapt foolishly on the spot trying to retrieve it malfoy jumped out of range of hermiones second stunning spell and ron appearing suddenly at the end of the aisle shot a full curse at crabbe which narrowly missed 
 
 crabbe wheeled around and screamed avada kedavra again ron leapt out of sight to avoid the jet of green light the malfoy cowered behind a wardrobe as hermione charged toward them hitting goyle with a stunning spell as she came 
 
 its somewhere here harry yelled at her pointing at the pile of junk into which the old tiara had fallen look for it while i go and help r c 
 
 harry she screamed 
 
 a roaring billowing noise behind him gave him a moments warning he turned and saw both ron and crabbe running as hard as they could up the aisle toward them 
 
 like it hot scum roared crabbe as he ran 
 
 but he seemed to have no control over what he had done flames of abnormal size were pursuing them licking up the sides of the junk bulwarks which were crumbling to soot at their touch 
 
 aguamenti harry bawled but the jet of water that soared from the tip of his wand evaporated in the air 
 
 run 
 
 malfoy grabbed the stunned goyle and dragged him along crabbe outstripped all of them now looking terrified harry ron and hermione pelted along in his wake and the fire pursued them it was not normal fire crabbe had used a curse of which harry had no knowledge as they turned a corner the flames chased them as though they were alive sentient intent upon killing them now the fire was mutating forming a gigantic pack of fiery beasts flaming serpents chimaeras and dragons rose and fell and rose again and the detritus of centuries on which they were feeding was thrown up into the air into their fanged mouths tossed high on clawed feet before being consumed by the inferno 
 
 malfoy crabbe and goyle had vanished from view harry ron and hermione stopped dead the fiery monsters were circling them drawing closer and closer claws and horns and tails lashed and the heat was solid as a wall around them 
 
 what can we do hermione screamed over the deafening roars of the fire what can we do 
 
 here 
 
 harry seized a pair of broomsticks from the nearest pile of junk and threw one to ron who pulled hermione onto it behind him harry swung his leg over the second broom and with hard kicks to the ground they soared up in the air missing by feet the horned beak of a flaming raptor that snapped its jaws at them the smoke and heat were becoming overwhelming below them the cursed fire was consuming the contraband of generations of hunted students the guilty outcomes of a thousand banned experiments the secrets of the countless souls who had sought refuge in the room harry could not see a trace of malfoy crabbe or goyle anywhere he swooped as low as he dare over the marauding monsters of flame to try to find them but there was nothing but fire what a terrible way to die he had never wanted this 
 
 harry lets get out lets get out bellowed ron though it was impossible to see where the door was through the black smoke 
 
 and then harry heard a thin piteous human scream from amidst the terrible commotion the thunder of devouring flame 
 
 its c too c dangerous c ron yelled but harry wheeled in the air his glasses giving his eyes some small protection from the smoke he raked the firestorm below seeking a sign of life a limb or a face that was not yet charred like wood 
 
 and he saw them malfoy with his arms around the unconscious goyle the pair of them perched on a fragile tower of charred desks and harry dived malfoy saw him coming and raised one arm but even as harry grasped it he knew at once that it was no good goyle was too heavy and malfoys hand covered in sweat slid instantly out of harrys c 
 
 if we die for them ill kill you harry roared rons voice and as a great flaming chimaera bore down upon them he and hermione dragged goyle onto their broom and rose rolling and pitching into the air once more as malfoy clambered up behind harry 
 
 the door get to the door the door screamed malfoy in harrys ear and harry sped up following ron hermione and goyle through the billowing black smoke hardly able to breathe and all around them the last few objects unburned by the devouring flames were flung into the air as the creatures of the cursed fire cast them high in celebration cups and shields a sparkling necklace and an old discolored tiara c 
 
 what are you doing what are you doing the doors that way screamed malfoy but harry made a hairpin swerve and dived the diadem seemed to fall in slow motion turning and glittering as it dropped toward the maw of a yawning serpent and then he had it caught it around his wrist c 
 
 harry swerved again as the serpent lunged at him he soared upward and straight toward the place where he prayed the door stood open ron hermione and goyle had vanished malfoy was screaming and holding harry so tightly it hurt then through the smoke harry saw a rectangular patch on the wall and steered the broom at it and moments later clean air filled his lungs and they collided with the wall in the corridor beyond 
 
 malfoy fell off the broom and lay facedown gasping coughing and retching harry rolled over and sat up the door to the room of requirement had vanished and ron and hermione sat panting on the floor beside goyle who was still unconscious 
 
 choked malfoy as soon as he could speak 
 
 hes dead said ron harshly 
 
 there was silence apart from panting and coughing then a number of huge bangs shook the castle and a great cavalcade of transparent figures galloped past on horses their heads screaming with bloodlust under their arms harry staggered to his feet when the headless hunt had passed and looked around the battle was still going on all around him he could hear more scream than those of the retreating ghosts panic flared within him 
 
 wheres ginny he said sharply she was here she was supposed to be going back into the room of requirement 
 
 blimey dyou reckon itll still work after that fire asked ron but he too got to his feet rubbing his chest and looking left and right shall we split up and look c 
 
 no said hermione getting to her feet too malfoy and goyle remained slumped hopelessly on the corridor floor neither of them had wands lets stick together i say we go c harry whats that on your arm 
 
 what oh yeah c 
 
 he pulled the diadem from his wrist and held it up it was still hot blackened with soot but as he looked at it closely he was just able to make out the tiny words etched upon it wit beyond measure is mans greatest treasure 
 
 a bloodlike substance dark and tarry seemed to be leaking from the diadem suddenly harry felt the thing vibrate violently then break apart in his hands and as it did so he thought he heard the faintest most distant scream of pain echoing not from the grounds or the castle but from the thing that had just fragmented in his fingers 
 
 it must have been fiendfyre whimpered hermione her eyes on the broken piece 
 
 sorry 
 
 fiendfyre c cursed fire c its one of the substances that destroy horcruxes but i would never ever have dared use it its so dangerous c how did crabbe know how to c 
 
 mustve learned from the carrows said harry grimly 
 
 shame he wasnt concentrating when they mentioned how to stop it really said ron whose hair like hermiones was singed and whose face was blackened if he hadnt tried to kill us all id be quite sorry he was dead 
 
 but dont you realize whispered hermione this means if we can just get the snake c 
 
 but she broke off as yells and shouts and the unmistakable noises of dueling filled the corridor harry looked around and his heart seemed to fail death eaters had penetrated hogwarts fred and percy had just backed into view both of them dueling masked and hooded men 
 
 harry ron and hermione ran forward to help jets of light flew in every direction and the man dueling percy backed off fast then his hood slipped and they saw a high forehead and streaked hair c 
 
 hello minister bellowed percy sending a neat jinx straight at thicknesse who dropped his wand and clawed at the front of his robes apparently in awful discomfort did i mention im resigning 
 
 youre joking perce shouted fred as the death eater he was battling collapsed under the weight of three separate stunning spells thicknesse had fallen to the ground with tiny spikes erupting all over him he seemed to be turning into some form of sea urchin fred looked at percy with glee 
 
 you actually are joking perce i dont think ive heard you joke since you were c 
 
 the air exploded they had been grouped together harry ron hermione fred and percy the two death eaters at their feet one stunned the other transfigured and in that fragment of a moment when danger seemed temporarily at bay the world was rent apart harry felt himself flying through the air and all he could do was hold as tightly as possible to that thin stick of wood that was his one and only weapon and shield his head in his arms he heard the screams and yells of his companions without a hope of knowing what had happened to them c 
 
 and then the world resolved itself into pain and semidarkness he was half buried in the wreckage of a corridor that had been subjected to a terrible attack cold air told him that the side of the castle had been blown away and hot stickiness on his cheek told him that he was bleeding copiously then he heard a terrible cry that pulled at his insides that expressed agony of a kind neither flame nor curse could cause and he stood up swaying more frightened than he had been that day more frightened perhaps than he had been in his life 
 
 and hermione was struggling to her feet in the wreckage and three redheaded men were grouped on the ground where the wall had blasted apart harry grabbed hermiones hand as they staggered and stumbled over stone and wood 
 
 no c no c no someone was shouting no fred no and percy was shaking his brother and ron was kneeling beside them and freds eyes stared without seeing the ghost of his last laugh still etched upon his face

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the angel 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 whenever a good child dies an angel of god comes down from 
 heaven takes the dead child in his arms spreads out his great 
 white wings and flies with him over all the places which the child 
 had loved during his life then he gathers a large handful of flowers 
 which he carries up to the almighty that they may bloom more brightly in heaven than they do on earth and the almighty presses the flowers to his heart but he kisses the flower that pleases him 
 best and it receives a voice and is able to join the song of the 
 chorus of bliss 
 
 these words were spoken by an angel of god as he carried a dead 
 child up to heaven and the child listened as if in a dream then they 
 passed over spots where the little one had often played 
 and through beautiful gardens full of lovely flowers 
 
 which of these shall we take with us to heaven to be transplanted 
 there asked the angel 
 
 close by grew a slender beautiful but some wicked 
 hand had broken the stem and the rosebuds hung faded 
 and withered on the trailing branches 
 
 poor said the child let us take it with us to 
 heaven that it may bloom above in garden 
 
 the angel took up the then he kissed the child and the 
 little one half opened his eyes the angel gathered also some 
 beautiful flowers as well as a few humble buttercups and 
 
 
 now we have flowers enough said the child but the angel only 
 nodded he did not fly upward to heaven 
 
 it was night and quite still in the great town here they 
 remained and the angel hovered over a small narrow street in 
 which lay a large heap of straw ashes and sweepings from the 
 houses of people who had removed there lay fragments of plates 
 pieces of plaster rags old hats and other rubbish not pleasant to 
 see amidst all this confusion the angel pointed to the pieces of a 
 broken and to a lump of earth which had fallen out of 
 it the earth had been kept from falling to pieces by the roots of a 
 withered which had been thrown amongst the rubbish 
 
 we will take this with us said the angel i will tell you why as we fly along 
 
 and as they flew the angel related the history 
 
 down in that narrow lane in a low cellar lived a poor sick boy 
 he had been afflicted from his childhood and even in his best days he 
 could just manage to walk up and down the room on crutches once or twice but no more during some days in summer the sunbeams would lie on the floor of the cellar for about half an hour in this spot the poor sick boy would sit warming himself in the sunshine and 
 watching the red blood through his delicate fingers as he held them 
 before his face then he would say he had been out yet he knew 
 nothing of the green forest in its spring verdure till a 
 son brought him a green bough from a this he would place over his head and fancy that he was in the while the sun shone and the birds carolled gayly one spring day the boy brought him some and among them was one to which the root still adhered this he carefully planted in a and placed in a near his bed and the flower had been planted by a fortunate hand for it grew put forth fresh shoots and blossomed every year it became a splendid to the sick boy and his little treasure upon earth he watered it and cherished it and took care it should have the benefit of every 
 sunbeam that found its way into the cellar from the earliest 
 morning ray to the evening sunset the flower entwined itself even 
 in his dreams for him it bloomed for him spread its perfume and 
 it gladdened his eyes and to the flower he turned even in death 
 when the lord called him he has been one year with god during that time the flower has stood in the window withered and forgotten 
 till at length cast out among the sweepings into the street on the 
 day of the lodgers removal and this poor flower withered and 
 faded as it is we have added to our nosegay because it gave more 
 real joy than the most beautiful flower in the garden of a queen 
 but how do you know all this asked the child whom the angel was 
 carrying to heaven 
 
 i know it said the angel because i myself was the poor sick 
 boy who walked upon crutches and i know my own flower well 
 then the child opened his eyes and looked into the glorious 
 happy face of the angel and at the same moment they found 
 themselves in that heavenly home where all is happiness and joy and 
 god pressed the dead child to his heart and wings were given him so that he could fly with the angel hand in hand then the almighty 
 pressed all the flowers to his heart but he kissed the withered 
 and it received a voice then it joined in the song of 
 the angels who surrounded the throne some near and others in a 
 distant circle but all equally happy they all joined in the chorus 
 of praise both great and small the good happy child and the 
 poor that once lay withered and cast away on a heap of 
 rubbish in a narrow dark street

 chapter xix 
 
 jean valjean takes his revenge 
 when jean valjean was left alone with javert he untied the rope which fastened the prisoner across the middle of the body and the knot of which was under the table 
 after this he made him a sign to rise 
 javert obeyed with that indefinable smile in which the supremacy of enchained authority is condensed 
 jean valjean took javert by the martingale as one would take a beast of burden by the and dragging the latter after him emerged from the slowly because javert with his impeded limbs could take only very short steps 
 jean valjean had the pistol in his hand 
 in this manner they crossed the inner trapezium of the barricade the insurgents all intent on the attack which was imminent had their backs turned to these two 
 marius alone stationed on one side at the extreme left of the barricade saw them pass 
 this group of victim and executioner was illuminated by the sepulchral light which he bore in his own soul 
 jean valjean with some difficulty but without relaxing his hold for a single instant made javert pinioned as he was scale the little entrenchment in the mondetour lane 
 when they had crossed this barrier they found themselves alone in the lane 
 no one saw them 
 among the heap they could distinguish a livid face streaming hair a pierced hand and the half nude breast of a woman 
 it was eponine 
 the corner of the houses hid them from the insurgents 
 the corpses carried away from the barricade formed a terrible pile a few paces distant 
 javert gazed askance at this body and profoundly calm said in a low tone 
 it strikes me that i know that girl 
 then he turned to jean valjean 
 jean valjean thrust the pistol under his arm and fixed on javert a look which it required no words to interpret 
 javert it is i 
 javert replied 
 take your revenge 
 jean valjean drew from his pocket a knife and opened it 
 a exclaimed javert you are right 
 that suits you better 
 jean valjean cut the martingale which javert had about his neck then he cut the cords on his wrists then stooping down he cut the cord on his feet and straightening himself up he said to him 
 you are free 
 javert was not easily astonished 
 still master of himself though he was he could not repress a start 
 he remained and motionless 
 jean valjean continued 
 i do not think that i shall escape from this place 
 but if by chance i do i live under the name of fauchelevent in the rue de arme no 
 javert snarled like a tiger which made him half open one corner of his mouth and he muttered between his teeth 
 have a care 
 go said jean valjean 
 javert began again 
 thou saidst fauchelevent rue de arme 
 number 
 javert repeated in a low 
 he buttoned up his coat once more resumed the military stiffness between his shoulders made a half turn folded his arms and supporting his chin on one of his hands he set out in the direction of the halles 
 jean valjean followed him with his eyes 
 a few minutes later javert turned round and shouted to jean valjean 
 you annoy me 
 kill me rather 
 javert himself did not notice that he no longer addressed jean valjean as thou 
 be off with you said jean valjean 
 javert retreated slowly 
 a moment later he turned the corner of the rue des precheurs 
 when javert had disappeared jean valjean fired his pistol in the air 
 then he returned to the barricade and said 
 it is done 
 in the meanwhile this is what had taken place 
 marius more intent on the outside than on the interior had not up to that time taken a good look at the pinioned spy in the dark background of the 
 when he beheld him in broad daylight striding over the barricade in order to proceed to his death he recognized him something suddenly recurred to his mind 
 he recalled the inspector of the rue de pontoise and the two pistols which the latter had handed to him and which he marius had used in this very barricade and not only did he recall his face but his name as well 
 this recollection was misty and troubled however like all his ideas 
 it was not an affirmation that he made but a question which he put to himself 
 is not that the inspector of police who told me that his name was javert 
 perhaps there was still time to intervene in behalf of that man but in the first place he must know whether this was javert 
 marius called to enjolras who had just stationed himself at the other extremity of the barricade 
 enjolras 
 what 
 what is the name of yonder man 
 what man 
 the police agent 
 do you know his name 
 of course 
 he told us 
 what is it 
 javert 
 marius sprang to his feet 
 at that moment they heard the report of the pistol 
 jean valjean and cried 
 it is done 
 a gloomy chill traversed marius heart

 book fifteen 
 chapter iii 
 
 princess mary postponed her departure sonya and the count tried to replace natasha but could not they saw that she alone was able to restrain her mother from unreasoning despair for three weeks natasha remained constantly at her side sleeping on a lounge chair in her room making her eat and drink and talking to her incessantly because the mere sound of her tender caressing tones soothed her mother 
 the wounded spirit could not could not heal death had torn from her half her life when the news of death had come she had been a fresh and vigorous woman of fifty but a month later she left her room a listless old woman taking no interest in life but the same blow that almost killed the countess this second blow restored natasha to life 
 a spiritual wound produced by a rending of the spiritual body is like a physical wound and strange as it may seem just as a deep wound may heal and its edges join physical and spiritual wounds alike can yet heal completely only as the result of a vital force from within 
 wound healed in that way she thought her life was ended but her love for her mother unexpectedly showed her that the essence of life love was still active within her love awoke and so did life 
 prince last days had bound princess mary and natasha together this new sorrow brought them still closer to one another princess mary put off her departure and for three weeks looked after natasha as if she had been a sick child the last weeks passed in her bedroom had strained physical strength 
 one afternoon noticing natasha shivering with fever princess mary took her to her own room and made her lie down on the bed natasha lay down but when princess mary had drawn the blinds and was going away she called her back 
 i want to sleep mary sit by me a little 
 you are tired try to sleep 
 no no why did you bring me away she will be asking for me 
 she is much better she spoke so well today said princess mary 
 natasha lay on the bed and in the semidarkness of the room scanned princess face 
 is she like him thought natasha yes like and yet not like but she is quite original strange new and unknown and she loves me what is in her heart all that is good but how what is her mind like what does she think about me yes she is splendid 
 mary she said timidly drawing princess hand to herself mary you think me wicked no mary darling how i love you let us be quite quite friends 
 and natasha embracing her began kissing her face and hands making princess mary feel shy but happy by this demonstration of her feelings 
 from that day a tender and passionate friendship such as exists only between women was established between princess mary and natasha they were continually kissing and saying tender things to one another and spent most of their time together when one went out the other became restless and hastened to rejoin her together they felt more in harmony with one another than either of them felt with herself when alone a feeling stronger than friendship sprang up between them an exclusive feeling of life being possible only in each presence 
 sometimes they were silent for hours sometimes after they were already in bed they would begin talking and go on till morning they spoke most of what was long past princess mary spoke of her childhood of her mother her father and her daydreams and natasha who with a passive lack of understanding had formerly turned away from that life of devotion submission and the poetry of christian now feeling herself bound to princess mary by affection learned to love her past too and to understand a side of life previously incomprehensible to her she did not think of applying submission and to her own life for she was accustomed to seek other joys but she understood and loved in another those previously incomprehensible virtues for princess mary listening to tales of childhood and early youth there also opened out a new and hitherto uncomprehended side of life belief in life and its enjoyment 
 just as before they never mentioned him so as not to lower as they thought their exalted feelings by words but this silence about him had the effect of making them gradually begin to forget him without being conscious of it 
 natasha had grown thin and pale and physically so weak that they all talked about her health and this pleased her but sometimes she was suddenly overcome by fear not only of death but of sickness weakness and loss of good looks and involuntarily she examined her bare arm carefully surprised at its thinness and in the morning noticed her drawn and as it seemed to her piteous face in her glass it seemed to her that things must be so and yet it was dreadfully sad 
 one day she went quickly upstairs and found herself out of breath unconsciously she immediately invented a reason for going down and then testing her strength ran upstairs again observing the result 
 another time when she called dunyasha her voice trembled so she called again though she could hear dunyasha coming called her in the deep chest tones in which she had been wont to sing sing and listened attentively to herself 
 she did not know and would not have believed it but beneath the layer of slime that covered her soul and seemed to her impenetrable delicate young shoots of grass were already sprouting which taking root would so cover with their living verdure the grief that weighed her down that it would soon no longer be seen or noticed the wound had begun to heal from within 
 at the end of january princess mary left for moscow and the count insisted on going with her to consult the doctors

 book war between four walls 
 chapter xx 
 
 the dead are in the right and the living are not in the wrong 
 the death agony of the barricade was about to begin 
 everything contributed to its tragic majesty at that supreme moment a thousand mysterious crashes in the air the breath of armed masses set in movement in the streets which were not visible the intermittent gallop of cavalry the heavy shock of artillery on the march the firing by squads and the cannonades crossing each other in the labyrinth of paris the smokes of battle mounting all gilded above the roofs indescribable and vaguely terrible cries lightnings of menace everywhere the tocsin of which now had the accents of a sob the mildness of the weather the splendor of the sky filled with sun and clouds the beauty of the day and the alarming silence of the houses 
 for since the preceding evening the two rows of houses in the rue de la chanvrerie had become two walls ferocious walls doors closed windows closed shutters closed 
 in those days so different from those in which we live when the hour was come when the people wished to put an end to a situation which had lasted too long with a charter granted or with a legal country when universal wrath was diffused in the atmosphere when the city consented to the tearing up of the pavements when insurrection made the bourgeoisie smile by whispering its password in its ear then the inhabitant thoroughly penetrated with the revolt so to speak was the auxiliary of the combatant and the house fraternized with the improvised fortress which rested on it 
 when the situation was not ripe when the insurrection was not decidedly admitted when the masses disowned the movement all was over with the combatants the city was changed into a desert around the revolt souls grew chilled refuges were nailed up and the street turned into a defile to help the army to take the barricade 
 a people cannot be forced through surprise to walk more quickly than it chooses 
 woe to whomsoever tries to force its hand 
 a people does not let itself go at random 
 then it abandons the insurrection to itself 
 the insurgents become noxious infected with the plague a house is an escarpment a door is a refusal a facade is a wall this wall hears sees and will not 
 it might open and save you no this wall is a judge 
 it gazes at you and condemns you what dismal things are closed houses 
 they seem dead they are living life which is as it were suspended there persists there no one has gone out of them for four and twenty hours but no one is missing from them 
 in the interior of that rock people go and come go to bed and rise again they are a family party there there they eat and drink they are afraid a terrible thing fear excuses this fearful lack of hospitality terror is mixed with it an extenuating circumstance 
 sometimes even and this has been actually seen fear turns to passion fright may change into fury as prudence does into rage hence this wise saying the enraged moderates 
 there are outbursts of supreme terror whence springs wrath like a mournful do these people want what have they come there to do 
 let them get out of the scrape so much the worse for them 
 it is their fault 
 they are only getting what they deserve 
 it does not concern us 
 here is our poor street all riddled with balls 
 they are a pack of rascals 
 above all things open the the house assumes the air of a tomb the insurgent is in the in front of that house he sees the and naked swords drawing near if he cries he knows that they are listening to him and that no one will come there stand walls which might protect him there are men who might save him and these walls have ears of flesh and these men have bowels of stone 
 whom shall he reproach 
 no one and every one 
 the incomplete times in which we live 
 it is always at its own risk and peril that utopia is converted into revolution and from philosophical protest becomes an armed protest and from minerva turns to pallas 
 the utopia which grows impatient and becomes revolt knows what awaits it it almost always comes too soon 
 then it becomes resigned and stoically accepts catastrophe in lieu of triumph 
 it serves those who deny it without complaint even excusing them and even disculpates them and its magnanimity consists in consenting to abandonment it is indomitable in the face of obstacles and gentle towards ingratitude 
 is this ingratitude however 
 yes from the point of view of the human race 
 no from the point of view of the individual 
 progress is mode of existence 
 the general life of the human race is called progress the collective stride of the human race is called progress 
 progress advances it makes the great human and terrestrial journey towards the celestial and the divine it has its halting places where it rallies the laggard troop it has its stations where it meditates in the presence of some splendid canaan suddenly unveiled on its horizon it has its nights when it sleeps and it is one of the poignant anxieties of the thinker that he sees the shadow resting on the human soul and that he gropes in darkness without being able to awaken that slumbering progress 
 god is dead perhaps said gerard de nerval one day to the writer of these lines confounding progress with god and taking the interruption of movement for the death of being 
 he who despairs is in the wrong 
 progress infallibly awakes and in short we may say that it marches on even when it is asleep for it has increased in size 
 when we behold it erect once more we find it taller 
 to be always peaceful does not depend on progress any more than it does on the stream erect no barriers cast in no boulders obstacles make water froth and humanity boil hence arise troubles but after these troubles we recognize the fact that ground has been gained 
 until order which is nothing else than universal peace has been established until harmony and unity reign progress will have revolutions as its 
 what then is progress 
 we have just enunciated it the permanent life of the peoples 
 now it sometimes happens that the momentary life of individuals offers resistance to the eternal life of the human race 
 let us admit without bitterness that the individual has his distinct interests and can without forfeiture stipulate for his interest and defend it the present has its pardonable dose of egotism momentary life has its rights and is not bound to sacrifice itself constantly to the future 
 the generation which is passing in its turn over the earth is not forced to abridge it for the sake of the generations its equal after all who will have their turn later exist murmurs that some one whose name is all i am young and in love i am old and i wish to repose i am the father of a family i toil i prosper i am successful in business i have houses to lease i have money in the government funds i am happy i have a wife and children i have all this i desire to live leave me in at certain hours a profound cold broods over the magnanimous vanguard of the human race 
 utopia moreover we must admit quits its radiant sphere when it makes war 
 it the truth of borrows its mode of procedure battle from the lie of yesterday 
 it the future behaves like the past 
 it pure idea becomes a deed of violence it complicates its heroism with a violence for which it is just that it should be held to answer a violence of occasion and expedient contrary to principle and for which it is fatally punished the utopia insurrection fights with the old military code in its fist it shoots spies it executes traitors it suppresses living beings and flings them into unknown darkness 
 it makes use of death a serious matter 
 it seems as though utopia had no longer any faith in radiance its irresistible and incorruptible force 
 it strikes with the sword 
 now no sword is simple 
 every blade has two edges he who wounds with the one is wounded with the other 
 having made this reservation and made it with all severity it is impossible for us not to admire whether they succeed or not those the glorious combatants of the future the confessors of utopia 
 even when they miscarry they are worthy of veneration and it is perhaps in failure that they possess the most majesty victory when it is in accord with progress merits the applause of the people but a heroic defeat merits their tender compassion the one is magnificent the other sublime 
 for our own part we prefer martyrdom to success 
 john brown is greater than washington and pisacane is greater than garibaldi 
 it certainly is necessary that some one should take the part of the vanquished 
 we are unjust towards these great men who attempt the future when they fail 
 revolutionists are accused of sowing fear abroad 
 every barricade seems a crime 
 their theories are incriminated their aim suspected their ulterior motive is feared their conscience denounced they are reproached with raising erecting and heaping up against the reigning social state a mass of miseries of griefs of iniquities of wrongs of despairs and of tearing from the lowest depths blocks of shadow in order therein to embattle themselves and to combat people shout to them 
 you are tearing up the pavements of hell they might reply 
 that is because our barricade is made of good intentions 
 the best thing assuredly is the pacific solution 
 in short let us agree that when we behold the pavement we think of the bear and it is a good will which renders society uneasy 
 but it depends on society to save itself it is to its own good will that we make our appeal 
 no violent remedy is necessary 
 to study evil amiably to prove its existence then to cure it 
 it is to this that we invite it 
 however that may be even when fallen above all when fallen these men who at every point of the universe with their eyes fixed on france are striving for the grand work with the inflexible logic of the ideal are august they give their life a free offering to progress they accomplish the will of providence they perform a religious act at the appointed hour with as much disinterestedness as an actor who answers to his cue in obedience to the divine they enter the tomb 
 and this hopeless combat this stoical disappearance they accept in order to bring about the supreme and universal consequences the magnificent and irresistibly human movement begun on the th of july these soldiers are priests the french revolution is an act of god 
 moreover there are and it is proper to add this distinction to the distinctions already pointed out in another are accepted revolutions revolutions which are called revolutions there are refused revolutions which are called riots 
 an insurrection which breaks out is an idea which is passing its examination before the people 
 if the people lets fall a black ball the idea is dried fruit the insurrection is a mere skirmish 
 waging war at every summons and every time that utopia desires it is not the thing for the peoples 
 nations have not always and at every hour the temperament of heroes and martyrs 
 they are positive 
 a priori insurrection is repugnant to them in the first place because it often results in a catastrophe in the second place because it always has an abstraction as its point of departure 
 because and this is a noble thing it is always for the ideal and for the ideal alone that those who sacrifice themselves do thus sacrifice themselves 
 an insurrection is an enthusiasm 
 enthusiasm may wax wroth hence the appeal to arms 
 but every insurrection which aims at a government or a regime aims higher 
 thus for instance and we insist upon it what the chiefs of the insurrection of and in particular the young enthusiasts of the rue de la chanvrerie were combating was not precisely louis philippe the majority of them when talking freely did justice to this king who stood midway between monarchy and revolution no one hated him but they attacked the younger branch of the divine right in louis philippe as they had attacked its elder branch in charles x and that which they wished to overturn in overturning royalty in france was as we have explained the usurpation of man over man and of privilege over right in the entire universe paris without a king has as result the world without despots this is the manner in which they reasoned 
 their aim was distant no doubt vague perhaps and it retreated in the face of their efforts but it was great 
 thus it is 
 and we sacrifice ourselves for these visions which are almost always illusions for the sacrificed but illusions with which after all the whole of human certainty is mingled we throw ourselves into these tragic affairs and become intoxicated with that which we are about to do 
 who knows 
 we may succeed we are few in number we have a whole army arrayed against us but we are defending right the natural law the sovereignty of each one over himself from which no abdication is possible justice and truth and in case of need we die like the three hundred spartans 
 we do not think of don quixote but of leonidas and we march straight before us and once pledged we do not draw back and we rush onwards with head held low cherishing as our hope an unprecedented victory revolution completed progress set free again the aggrandizement of the human race universal deliverance and in the event of the worst thermopylae 
 these passages of arms for the sake of progress often suffer shipwreck and we have just explained why 
 the crowd is restive in the presence of the impulses of paladins 
 heavy masses the multitudes which are fragile because of their very weight fear adventures and there is a touch of adventure in the ideal 
 moreover and we must not forget this interests which are not very friendly to the ideal and the sentimental are in the way sometimes the stomach paralyzes the heart 
 the grandeur and beauty of france lies in this that she takes less from the stomach than other nations 
 she more easily knots the rope about her loins 
 she is the first awake the last asleep she marches forwards 
 she is a seeker 
 this arises from the fact that she is an artist 
 the ideal is nothing but the culminating point of logic the same as the beautiful is nothing but the summit of the true artistic peoples are also consistent peoples 
 to love beauty is to see the light 
 that is why the torch of europe that is to say of civilization was first borne by greece who passed it on to italy who handed it on to france 
 divine illuminating nations of scouts vitaelampada tradunt 
 it is an admirable thing that the poetry of a people is the element of its progress 
 the amount of civilization is measured by the quantity of imagination 
 only a civilizing people should remain a manly people 
 corinth yes sybaris no 
 whoever becomes effeminate makes himself a bastard 
 he must be neither a dilettante nor a virtuoso 
 but he must be artistic 
 in the matter of civilization he must not refine but he must sublime 
 on this condition one gives to the human race the pattern of the ideal 
 the modern ideal has its type in art and its means is science it is through science that it will realize that august vision of the poets the socially beautiful 
 eden will be reconstructed by at the point which civilization has now reached the exact is a necessary element of the splendid and the artistic sentiment is not only served but completed by the scientific organ dreams must be calculated 
 art which is the conqueror should have for support science which is the walker the solidity of the creature which is ridden is of importance 
 the modern spirit is the genius of greece with the genius of india as its vehicle alexander on the elephant 
 races which are petrified in dogma or demoralized by lucre are unfit to guide civilization 
 genuflection before the idol or before money wastes away the muscles which walk and the will which advances hieratic or mercantile absorption lessens a power of radiance lowers its horizon by lowering its level and deprives it of that intelligence at once both human and divine of the universal goal which makes missionaries of nations 
 babylon has no ideal carthage has no ideal 
 athens and rome have and keep throughout all the nocturnal darkness of the centuries halos of civilization 
 france is in the same quality of race as greece and italy she is athenian in the matter of beauty and roman in her greatness moreover she is good 
 she gives herself 
 oftener than is the case with other races is she in the humor for and sacrifice only this humor seizes upon her and again abandons her and therein lies the great peril for those who run when she desires only to walk or who walk on when she desires to halt france has her relapses into materialism and at certain instants the ideas which obstruct that sublime brain have no longer anything which recalls french greatness and are of the dimensions of a missouri or a south carolina 
 what is to be done in such a case the giantess plays at being a dwarf immense france has her freaks of pettiness 
 that is all 
 to this there is nothing to say 
 peoples like planets possess the right to an eclipse 
 and all is well provided that the light returns and that the eclipse does not degenerate into night dawn and resurrection are synonymous 
 the reappearance of the light is identical with the persistence of the i 
 let us state these facts calmly 
 death on the barricade or the tomb in exile is an acceptable occasion for devotion the real name of devotion is disinterestedness 
 let the abandoned allow themselves to be abandoned let the exiled allow themselves to be exiled and let us confine ourselves to entreating great nations not to retreat too far when they do retreat 
 one must not push too far in descent under pretext of a return to reason 
 matter exists the minute exists interest exists the stomach exists but the stomach must not be the sole wisdom 
 the life of the moment has its rights we admit but permanent life has its rights also alas the fact that one is mounted does not preclude a fall this can be seen in history more frequently than is desirable a nation is great it tastes the ideal then it bites the mire and finds it good and if it be asked how it happens that it has abandoned socrates for falstaff it replies 
 because i love statesmen 
 one word more before returning to our subject the conflict 
 a battle like the one which we are engaged in describing is nothing else than a convulsion towards the ideal 
 progress trammelled is sickly and is subject to these tragic epilepsies 
 with that malady of progress civil war we have been obliged to come in contact in our passage 
 this is one of the fatal phases at once act and of that drama whose pivot is a social condemnation and whose veritable title is progress 
 progress 
 the cry to which we frequently give utterance is our whole thought and at the point of this drama which we have now reached the idea which it contains having still more than one trial to undergo it is perhaps permitted to us if not to lift the veil from it to at least allow its light to shine through 
 the book which the reader has under his eye at this moment is from one end to the other as a whole and in detail whatever may be its intermittences exceptions and faults the march from evil to good from the unjust to the just from night to day from appetite to conscience from rottenness to life from hell to heaven from nothingness to god 
 point of departure 
 matter point of arrival the soul 
 the hydra at the beginning the angel at the end

 chapter iv 
 
 after the encounter at vyazma where kutuzov had been unable to hold back his troops in their anxiety to overwhelm and cut off the enemy and so on the farther movement of the fleeing french and of the russians who pursued them continued as far as krasnoe without a battle the flight was so rapid that the russian army pursuing the french could not keep up with them cavalry and artillery horses broke down and the information received of the movements of the french was never reliable 
 the men in the russian army were so worn out by this continuous marching at the rate of miles a day that they could not go any faster 
 to realize the degree of exhaustion of the russian army it is only necessary to grasp clearly the meaning of the fact that while not losing more than five thousand killed and wounded after tarutino and less than a hundred prisoners the russian army which left that place a hundred thousand strong reached krasnoe with only fifty thousand 
 the rapidity of the russian pursuit was just as destructive to our army as the flight of the french was to theirs the only difference was that the russian army moved voluntarily with no such threat of destruction as hung over the french and that the sick frenchmen were left behind in enemy hands while the sick russians left behind were among their own people the chief cause of the wastage of army was the rapidity of its movement and a convincing proof of this is the corresponding decrease of the russian army 
 kutuzov as far as was in his power instead of trying to check the movement of the french as was desired in petersburg and by the russian army generals directed his whole activity here as he had done at tarutino and vyazma to hastening it on while easing the movement of our army 
 but besides this since the exhaustion and enormous diminution of the army caused by the rapidity of the advance had become evident another reason for slackening the pace and delaying presented itself to kutuzov the aim of the russian army was to pursue the french the road the french would take was unknown and so the closer our troops trod on their heels the greater distance they had to cover only by following at some distance could one cut across the zigzag path of the french all the artful maneuvers suggested by our generals meant fresh movements of the army and a lengthening of its marches whereas the only reasonable aim was to shorten those marches to that end activity was directed during the whole campaign from moscow to vilna not casually or intermittently but so consistently that he never once deviated from it 
 kutuzov felt and knew not by reasoning or science but with the whole of his russian being what every russian soldier felt that the french were beaten that the enemy was flying and must be driven out but at the same time he like the soldiers realized all the hardship of this march the rapidity of which was unparalleled for such a time of the year 
 but to the generals especially the foreign ones in the russian army who wished to distinguish themselves to astonish somebody and for some reason to capture a king or a duke it seemed that now when any battle must be horrible and senseless was the very time to fight and conquer somebody kutuzov merely shrugged his shoulders when one after another they presented projects of maneuvers to be made with those soldiers insufficiently clad and half starved who within a month and without fighting a battle had dwindled to half their number and who at the best if the flight continued would have to go a greater distance than they had already traversed before they reached the frontier 
 this longing to distinguish themselves to maneuver to overthrow and to cut off showed itself particularly whenever the russians stumbled on the french army 
 so it was at krasnoe where they expected to find one of the three french columns and stumbled instead on napoleon himself with sixteen thousand men despite all efforts to avoid that ruinous encounter and to preserve his troops the massacre of the broken mob of french soldiers by russians continued at krasnoe for three days 
 toll wrote a disposition the first column will march to so and so etc and as usual nothing happened in accord with the disposition prince eugene of wurttemberg fired from a hill over the french crowds that were running past and demanded reinforcements which did not arrive the french avoiding the russians dispersed and hid themselves in the forest by night making their way round as best they could and continued their flight 
 miloradovich who said he did not want to know anything about the commissariat affairs of his detachment and could never be found when he was wanted that chevalier sans peur et sans reproche as he styled himself who was fond of parleys with the french sent envoys demanding their surrender wasted time and did not do what he was ordered to do 
 knight without fear and without reproach 
 i give you that column lads he said riding up to the troops and pointing out the french to the cavalry 
 and the cavalry with spurs and sabers urging on horses that could scarcely move trotted with much effort to the column presented to them that is to say to a crowd of frenchmen stark with cold and starving and the column that had been presented to them threw down its arms and surrendered as it had long been anxious to do 
 at krasnoe they took thousand prisoners several hundred cannon and a stick called a staff and disputed as to who had distinguished himself and were pleased with their achievement though they much regretted not having taken napoleon or at least a marshal or a hero of some sort and reproached one another and especially kutuzov for having failed to do so 
 these men carried away by their passions were but blind tools of the most melancholy law of necessity but considered themselves heroes and imagined that they were accomplishing a most noble and honorable deed they blamed kutuzov and said that from the very beginning of the campaign he had prevented their vanquishing napoleon that he thought nothing but satisfying his passions and would not advance from the linen factories because he was comfortable there that at krasnoe he checked the advance because on learning that napoleon was there he had quite lost his head and that it was probable that he had an understanding with napoleon and had been bribed by him and so on and so on 
 not only did his contempories carried away by their passions talk in this way but posterity and history have acclaimed napoleon as grand while kutuzov is described by foreigners as a crafty dissolute weak old courtier and by russians as something indefinite a sort of puppet useful only because he had a russian name

 book war between four walls 
 chapter xxi 
 
 the heroes 
 all at once the drum beat the charge 
 the attack was a hurricane 
 on the evening before in the darkness the barricade had been approached silently as by a boa 
 now in broad daylight in that widening street surprise was decidedly impossible rude force had moreover been unmasked the cannon had begun the roar the army hurled itself on the barricade 
 fury now became skill a powerful detachment of infantry of the line broken at regular intervals by the national guard and the municipal guard on foot and supported by serried masses which could be heard though not seen debauched into the street at a run with drums beating trumpets braying bayonets levelled the sappers at their head and imperturbable under the projectiles charged straight for the barricade with the weight of a brazen beam against a wall 
 the wall held firm 
 the insurgents fired impetuously 
 the barricade once scaled had a mane of lightning flashes 
 the assault was so furious that for one moment it was inundated with assailants but it shook off the soldiers as the lion shakes off the dogs and it was only covered with besiegers as the cliff is covered with foam to a moment later beetling black and formidable 
 the column forced to retreat remained massed in the street unprotected but terrible and replied to the redoubt with a terrible discharge of musketry 
 any one who has seen fireworks will recall the sheaf formed of interlacing lightnings which is called a bouquet let the reader picture to himself this bouquet no longer vertical but horizontal bearing a bullet or a biscaien at the tip of each one of its jets of flame and picking off dead men one after another from its clusters of lightning 
 the barricade was underneath it 
 on both sides the resolution was equal 
 the bravery exhibited there was almost barbarous and was complicated with a sort of heroic ferocity which began by the sacrifice of self 
 this was the epoch when a national guardsman fought like a zouave the troop wished to make an end of it insurrection was desirous of fighting 
 the acceptance of the death agony in the flower of youth and in the flush of health turns intrepidity into frenzy in this fray each one underwent the broadening growth of the death hour the street was strewn with corpses 
 the barricade had enjolras at one of its extremities and marius at the other 
 enjolras who carried the whole barricade in his head reserved and sheltered himself three soldiers fell one after the other under his embrasure without having even seen him marius fought unprotected 
 he made himself a target 
 he stood with more than half his body above the breastworks 
 there is no more violent prodigal than the avaricious man who takes the bit in his teeth there is no man more terrible in action than a dreamer marius was formidable and pensive 
 in battle he was as in a dream one would have pronounced him a phantom engaged in firing a gun 
 the insurgents cartridges were giving out but not their sarcasms in this whirlwind of the sepulchre in which they stood they laughed 
 courfeyrac was 
 what have you done with your hat 
 bossuet asked him 
 courfeyrac replied 
 they have finally taken it away from me with 
 or they uttered haughty comments 
 can any one understand exclaimed feuilly bitterly those he cited names names even celebrated names some belonging to the old had promised to join us and taken an oath to aid us and who had pledged their honor to it and who are our generals and who abandon us 
 and combeferre restricted himself to replying with a grave smile 
 there are people who observe the rules of honor as one observes the stars from a great distance 
 the interior of the barricade was so strewn with torn cartridges that one would have said that there had been a snowstorm 
 the assailants had numbers in their favor the insurgents had position they were at the top of a wall and they thundered upon the soldiers tripping over the dead and wounded and entangled in the escarpment 
 this barricade constructed as it was and admirably buttressed was really one of those situations where a handful of men hold a legion in check 
 nevertheless the attacking column constantly recruited and enlarged under the shower of bullets drew inexorably nearer and now little by little step by step but surely the army closed in around the barricade as the vice grasps the 
 one assault followed another 
 the horror of the situation kept increasing 
 then there burst forth on that heap of in that rue de la chanvrerie a battle worthy of a wall of troy these haggard ragged exhausted men who had had nothing to eat for four and twenty hours who had not slept who had but a few more rounds to fire who were fumbling in their pockets which had been emptied of cartridges nearly all of whom were wounded with head or arm bandaged with black and linen with holes in their clothes from which the blood trickled and who were hardly armed with poor guns and notched swords became titans the barricade was ten times attacked approached assailed scaled and never captured 
 in order to form an idea of this struggle it is necessary to imagine fire set to a throng of terrible courages and then to gaze at the conflagration 
 it was not a combat it was the interior of a furnace there mouths breathed the flame there countenances were extraordinary 
 the human form seemed impossible there the combatants flamed forth there and it was formidable to behold the going and coming in that red glow of those salamanders of the fray 
 the successive and simultaneous scenes of this grand slaughter we renounce all attempts at depicting 
 the epic alone has the right to fill twelve thousand verses with a battle 
 one would have pronounced this that hell of brahmanism the most redoubtable of the seventeen abysses which the veda calls the forest of swords 
 they fought hand to hand foot to foot with pistol shots with blows of the sword with their fists at a distance close at hand from above from below from everywhere from the roofs of the houses from the windows of the from the cellar windows whither some had crawled 
 they were one against sixty 
 the facade of corinthe half demolished was hideous 
 the window tattooed with had lost glass and frame and was nothing now but a shapeless hole tumultuously blocked with 
 bossuet was killed feuilly was killed courfeyrac was killed combeferre transfixed by three blows from a bayonet in the breast at the moment when he was lifting up a wounded soldier had only time to cast a glance to heaven when he expired 
 marius still fighting was so riddled with wounds particularly in the head that his countenance disappeared beneath the blood and one would have said that his face was covered with a red kerchief 
 enjolras alone was not struck 
 when he had no longer any weapon he reached out his hands to right and left and an insurgent thrust some arm or other into his fist 
 all he had left was the stumps of four swords one more than francois i at marignan 
 homer says diomedes cuts the throat of axylus son of teuthranis who dwelt in happy arisba euryalus son of mecistaeus exterminates dresos and opheltios esepius and that pedasus whom the naiad abarbarea bore to the blameless bucolion ulysses overthrows pidytes of percosius antilochus ablerus polypaetes astyalus polydamas otos of cyllene and teucer aretaon 
 meganthios dies under the blows of euripylus pike 
 agamemnon king of the heroes flings to earth elatos born in the rocky city which is laved by the sounding river satnois in our old poems of exploits esplandian attacks the giant marquis swantibore with a of fire and the latter defends himself by stoning the hero with towers which he plucks up by the roots 
 our ancient mural frescoes show us the two dukes of bretagne and bourbon armed emblazoned and crested in guise on horseback and approaching each other their in hand masked with iron gloved with iron booted with iron the one caparisoned in ermine the other draped in azure 
 bretagne with his lion between the two horns of his crown bourbon helmeted with a monster fleur de lys on his visor 
 but in order to be superb it is not necessary to wear like yvon the ducal morion to have in the fist like esplandian a living flame or like phyles father of polydamas to have brought back from ephyra a good suit of mail a present from the king of men euphetes it suffices to give life for a conviction or a loyalty 
 this ingenuous little soldier yesterday a peasant of bauce or limousin who prowls with his by his side around the nurses in the luxembourg garden this pale young student bent over a piece of anatomy or a book a blond youth who shaves his beard with both of them breathe upon them with a breath of duty place them face to face in the carrefour boucherat or in the blind alley and let the one fight for his flag and the other for his ideal and let both of them imagine that they are fighting for their country the struggle will be colossal and the shadow which this raw recruit and this sawbones in conflict will produce in that grand epic field where humanity is striving will equal the shadow cast by megaryon king of lycia crushing in his embrace the immense body of ajax equal to the gods

 in and kutuzov was openly accused of blundering the emperor was dissatisfied with him and in a history recently written by order of the highest authorities it is said that kutuzov was a cunning court liar frightened of the name of napoleon and that by his blunders at krasnoe and the berezina he deprived the russian army of the glory of complete victory over the french 
 history of the year the character of kutuzov and reflections on the unsatisfactory results of the battles at krasnoe by bogdanovich 
 such is the fate not of great men grands hommes whom the russian mind does not acknowledge but of those rare and always solitary individuals who discerning the will of providence submit their personal will to it the hatred and contempt of the crowd punish such men for discerning the higher laws 
 for russian historians strange and terrible to say napoleon that most insignificant tool of history who never anywhere even in exile showed human dignity napoleon is the object of adulation and enthusiasm he is grand but kutuzov the man who from the beginning to the end of his activity in never once swerving by word or deed from borodino to vilna presented an example exceptional in history of and a present conciousness of the future importance of what was happening kutuzov seems to them something indefinite and pitiful and when speaking of him and of the year they always seem a little ashamed 
 and yet it is difficult to imagine an historical character whose activity was so unswervingly directed to a single aim and it would be difficult to imagine any aim more worthy or more consonant with the will of the whole people still more difficult would it be to find an instance in history of the aim of an historical personage being so completely accomplished as that to which all efforts were directed in 
 kutuzov never talked of forty centuries looking down from the pyramids of the sacrifices he offered for the fatherland or of what he intended to accomplish or had accomplished in general he said nothing about himself adopted no prose always appeared to be the simplest and most ordinary of men and said the simplest and most ordinary things he wrote letters to his daughters and to madame de stael read novels liked the society of pretty women jested with generals officers and soldiers and never contradicted those who tried to prove anything to him when count rostopchin at the yauza bridge galloped up to kutuzov with personal reproaches for having caused the destruction of moscow and said how was it you promised not to abandon moscow without a battle kutuzov replied and i shall not abandon moscow without a battle though moscow was then already abandoned when arakcheev coming to him from the emperor said that ermolov ought to be appointed chief of the artillery kutuzov replied yes i was just saying so myself though a moment before he had said quite the contrary what did it matter to him who then alone amid a senseless crowd understood the whole tremendous significance of what was happening what did it matter to him whether rostopchin attributed the calamities of moscow to him or to himself still less could it matter to him who was appointed chief of the artillery 
 not merely in these cases but continually did that old man who by experience of life had reached the conviction that thoughts and the words serving as their expression are not what move people use quite meaningless words that happened to enter his head 
 but that man so heedless of his words did not once during the whole time of his activity utter one word inconsistent with the single aim toward which he moved throughout the whole war obviously in spite of himself in very diverse circumstances he repeatedly expressed his real thoughts with the bitter conviction that he would not be understood beginning with the battle of borodino from which time his disagreement with those about him began he alone said that the battle of borodino was a victory and repeated this both verbally and in his dispatches and reports up to the time of his death he alone said that the loss of moscow is not the loss of russia in reply to proposal of peace he said there can be no peace for such is the will he alone during the retreat of the french said that all our maneuvers are useless everything is being accomplished of itself better than we could desire that the enemy must be offered a golden bridge that neither the tarutino the vyazma nor the krasnoe battles were necessary that we must keep some force to reach the frontier with and that he would not sacrifice a single russian for ten frenchmen 
 and this courtier as he is described to us who lies to arakcheev to please the emperor he alone incurring thereby the displeasure said in vilna that to carry the war beyond the frontier is useless and harmful 
 nor do words alone prove that only he understood the meaning of the events his actions without the smallest deviation were all directed to one and the same threefold end to brace all his strength for conflict with the french to defeat them and to drive them out of russia minimizing as far as possible the sufferings of our people and of our army 
 this procrastinator kutuzov whose motto was patience and time this enemy of decisive action gave battle at borodino investing the preparations for it with unparalleled solemnity this kutuzov who before the battle of austerlitz began said that it would be lost he alone in contradiction to everyone else declared till his death that borodino was a victory despite the assurance of generals that the battle was lost and despite the fact that for an army to have to retire after winning a battle was unprecedented he alone during the whole retreat insisted that battles which were useless then should not be fought and that a new war should not be begun nor the frontiers of russia crossed 
 it is easy now to understand the significance of these events if only we abstain from attributing to the activity of the mass aims that existed only in the heads of a dozen individuals for the events and results now lie before us 
 but how did that old man alone in opposition to the general opinion so truly discern the importance of the view of the events that in all his activity he was never once untrue to it 
 the source of that extraordinary power of penetrating the meaning of the events then occuring lay in the national feeling which he possessed in full purity and strength 
 only the recognition of the fact that he possessed this feeling caused the people in so strange a manner contrary to the wish to select him an old man in disfavor to be their representative in the national war and only that feeling placed him on that highest human pedestal from which he the commander in chief devoted all his powers not to slaying and destroying men but to saving and showing pity on them 
 that simple modest and therefore truly great figure could not be cast in the false mold of a european hero the supposed ruler of men that history has invented 
 to a lackey no man can be great for a lackey has his own conception of greatness

 when there were no longer any of the leaders left alive except enjolras and marius at the two extremities of the barricade the centre which had so long sustained courfeyrac joly bossuet feuilly and combeferre gave way 
 the cannon though it had not effected a practicable breach had made a rather large hollow in the middle of the redoubt there the summit of the wall had disappeared before the balls and had crumbled away and the rubbish which had fallen now inside now outside had as it accumulated formed two piles in the nature of slopes on the two sides of the barrier one on the inside the other on the outside the exterior slope presented an inclined plane to the attack 
 a final assault was there attempted and this assault succeeded the mass bristling with bayonets and hurled forward at a run came up with irresistible force and the serried front of battle of the attacking column made its appearance through the smoke on the crest of the battlements 
 this time it was decisive the group of insurgents who were defending the centre retreated in confusion 
 then the gloomy love of life awoke once more in some of them many finding themselves under the muzzles of this forest of guns did not wish to die 
 this is a moment when the instinct of emits howls when the beast in men they were hemmed in by the lofty house which formed the background of their redoubt 
 this house might prove their salvation the building was barricaded and walled as it were from top to bottom before the troops of the line had reached the interior of the redoubt there was time for a door to open and shut the space of a flash of lightning was sufficient for that and the door of that house suddenly opened a crack and closed again instantly was life for these despairing men 
 behind this house there were streets possible flight space 
 they set to knocking at that door with the butts of their guns and with kicks shouting calling entreating wringing their hands 
 no one opened 
 from the little window on the third floor the head of the dead man gazed down upon them 
 but enjolras and marius and the seven or eight rallied about them sprang forward and protected them 
 enjolras had shouted to the soldiers 
 advance and as an officer had not obeyed enjolras had killed the officer 
 he was now in the little inner court of the redoubt with his back planted against the corinthe building a sword in one hand a rifle in the other holding open the door of the which he barred against assailants 
 he shouted to the desperate is but one door open this one and shielding them with his body and facing an entire battalion alone he made them pass in behind him 
 all precipitated themselves thither enjolras executing with his rifle which he now used like a cane what players call a covered rose round his head levelled the bayonets around and in front of him and was the last to enter and then ensued a horrible moment when the soldiers tried to make their way in and the insurgents strove to bar them out the door was slammed with such violence that as it fell back into its frame it showed the five fingers of a soldier who had been clinging to it cut off and glued to the post 
 marius remained outside 
 a shot had just broken his collar bone he felt that he was fainting and falling 
 at that moment with eyes already shut he felt the shock of a vigorous hand seizing him and the swoon in which his senses vanished hardly allowed him time for the thought mingled with a last memory of am taken prisoner 
 i shall be shot 
 enjolras not seeing marius among those who had taken refuge in the had the same idea 
 but they had reached a moment when each man has not the time to meditate on his own death enjolras fixed the bar across the door and bolted it and it with key and chain while those outside were battering furiously at it the soldiers with the butts of their muskets the sappers with their axes 
 the assailants were grouped about that door the siege of the was now beginning 
 the soldiers we will observe were full of wrath 
 the death of the had enraged them and then a still more melancholy circumstance 
 during the few hours which had preceded the attack it had been reported among them that the insurgents were mutilating their prisoners and that there was the headless body of a soldier in the this sort of fatal rumor is the usual accompaniment of civil wars and it was a false report of this kind which later on produced the catastrophe of the rue transnonain 
 when the door was barricaded enjolras said to the others 
 let us sell our lives dearly 
 then he approached the table on which lay mabeuf and gavroche beneath the black cloth two straight and rigid forms were visible one large the other small and the two faces were vaguely outlined beneath the cold folds of the shroud 
 a hand projected from beneath the winding sheet and hung near the floor 
 it was that of the old man 
 enjolras bent down and kissed that venerable hand just as he had kissed his brow on the preceding evening 
 these were the only two kisses which he had bestowed in the course of his life 
 let us abridge the tale 
 the barricade had fought like a gate of thebes the fought like a house of saragossa these resistances are dogged 
 no quarter 
 no flag of truce possible men are willing to die provided their opponent will kill them 
 when suchet replies 
 after the war with cannon the war with knives 
 nothing was lacking in the capture by assault of the hucheloup neither raining from the windows and the roof on the besiegers and exasperating the soldiers by crushing them horribly nor shots fired from the and the cellar nor the fury of attack nor finally when the door yielded the frenzied madness of extermination the assailants rushing into the their feet entangled in the panels of the door which had been beaten in and flung on the ground found not a single combatant there 
 the spiral staircase hewn asunder with the axe lay in the middle of the a few wounded men were just breathing their last every one who was not killed was on the first floor and from there through the hole in the ceiling which had formed the entrance of the stairs a terrific fire burst forth 
 it was the last of their cartridges when they were exhausted when these formidable men on the point of death had no longer either powder or ball each grasped in his hands two of the bottles which enjolras had reserved and of which we have spoken and held the scaling party in check with these frightfully fragile clubs 
 they were bottles of aquafortis 
 we relate these gloomy incidents of carnage as they occurred the besieged man alas converts everything into a weapon 
 greek fire did not disgrace archimedes boiling pitch did not disgrace bayard all war is a thing of terror and there is no choice in it the musketry of the besiegers though confined and embarrassed by being directed from below upwards was deadly 
 the rim of the hole in the ceiling was speedily surrounded by heads of the slain whence dripped long red and smoking streams the uproar was indescribable a close and burning smoke almost produced night over this combat words are lacking to express horror when it has reached this pitch there were no longer men in this conflict which was now infernal they were no longer giants matched with colossi 
 it resembled milton and dante rather than homer 
 demons attacked spectres resisted 
 it was heroism become monstrous

 the fifth of november was the first day of what is called the battle of krasnoe toward evening after much disputing and many mistakes made by generals who did not go to their proper places and after adjutants had been sent about with counterorders when it had become plain that the enemy was everywhere in flight and that there could and would be no battle kutuzov left krasnoe and went to dobroe whither his headquarters had that day been transferred 
 the day was clear and frosty kutuzov rode to dobroe on his plump little white horse followed by an enormous suite of discontented generals who whispered among themselves behind his back all along the road groups of french prisoners captured that day there were seven thousand of them were crowding to warm themselves at campfires near dobroe an immense crowd of tattered prisoners buzzing with talk and wrapped and bandaged in anything they had been able to get hold of were standing in the road beside a long row of unharnessed french guns at the approach of the commander in chief the buzz of talk ceased and all eyes were fixed on kutuzov who wearing a white cap with a red band and a padded overcoat that bulged on his round shoulders moved slowly along the road on his white horse one of the generals was reporting to him where the guns and prisoners had been captured 
 kutuzov seemed preoccupied and did not listen to what the general was saying he screwed up his eyes with a dissatisfied look as he gazed attentively and fixedly at these prisoners who presented a specially wretched appearance most of them were disfigured by noses and cheeks and nearly all had red swollen and festering eyes 
 one group of the french stood close to the road and two of them one of whom had his face covered with sores were tearing a piece of raw flesh with their hands there was something horrible and bestial in the fleeting glance they threw at the riders and in the malevolent expression with which after a glance at kutuzov the soldier with the sores immediately turned away and went on with what he was doing 
 kutuzov looked long and intently at these two soldiers he puckered his face screwed up his eyes and pensively swayed his head at another spot he noticed a russian soldier laughingly patting a frenchman on the shoulder saying something to him in a friendly manner and kutuzov with the same expression on his face again swayed his head 
 what were you saying he asked the general who continuing his report directed the commander in attention to some standards captured from the french and standing in front of the preobrazhensk regiment 
 ah the standards said kutuzov evidently detaching himself with difficulty from the thoughts that preoccupied him 
 he looked about him absently thousands of eyes were looking at him from all sides awaiting a word from him 
 he stopped in front of the preobrazhensk regiment sighed deeply and closed his eyes one of his suite beckoned to the soldiers carrying the standards to advance and surround the commander in chief with them kutuzov was silent for a few seconds and then submitting with evident reluctance to the duty imposed by his position raised his head and began to speak a throng of officers surrounded him he looked attentively around at the circle of officers recognizing several of them 
 i thank you all he said addressing the soldiers and then again the officers in the stillness around him his slowly uttered words were distinctly heard i thank you all for your hard and faithful service the victory is complete and russia will not forget you honor to you forever 
 he paused and looked around 
 lower its head lower it he said to a soldier who had accidentally lowered the french eagle he was holding before the preobrazhensk standards lower lower it hurrah lads he added addressing the men with a rapid movement of his chin 
 roared thousands of voices 
 while the soldiers were shouting kutuzov leaned forward in his saddle and bowed his head and his eye lit up with a mild and apparently ironic gleam 
 you see brothers said he when the shouts had ceased and all at once his voice and the expression of his face changed it was no longer the commander in chief speaking but an ordinary old man who wanted to tell his comrades something very important 
 there was a stir among the throng of officers and in the ranks of the soldiers who moved that they might hear better what he was going to say 
 you see brothers i know hard for you but it be helped bear up it be for long now see our visitors off and then rest the tsar forget your service it is hard for you but still you are at home while they you see what they have come to said he pointing to the prisoners worse off than our poorest beggars while they were strong we spare ourselves but now we may even pity them they are human beings too it so lads 
 he looked around and in the direct respectful wondering gaze fixed upon him he read sympathy with what he had said his face grew brighter and brighter with an old mild smile which drew the corners of his lips and eyes into a cluster of wrinkles he ceased speaking and bowed his head as if in perplexity 
 but after all who asked them here serves them right the bloody bastards he cried suddenly lifting his head 
 and flourishing his whip he rode off at a gallop for the first time during the whole campaign and left the broken ranks of the soldiers laughing joyfully and shouting hurrah 
 words were hardly understood by the troops no one could have repeated the field address begun solemnly and then changing into an old simplehearted talk but the hearty sincerity of that speech the feeling of majestic triumph combined with pity for the foe and consciousness of the justice of our cause exactly expressed by that old expletives was not merely understood but lay in the soul of every soldier and found expression in their joyous and shouts afterwards when one of the generals addressed kutuzov asking whether he wished his caleche to be sent for kutuzov in answering unexpectedly gave a sob being evidently greatly moved

 orestes fasting and pylades drunk 
 at length by dint of mounting on each backs aiding themselves with the skeleton of the staircase climbing up the walls clinging to the ceiling slashing away at the very brink of the the last one who offered resistance a score of assailants soldiers national guardsmen municipal guardsmen in utter confusion the majority disfigured by wounds in the face during that redoubtable ascent blinded by blood furious rendered savage made an irruption into the apartment on the first floor 
 there they found only one man still on his feet enjolras 
 without cartridges without sword he had nothing in his hand now but the barrel of his gun whose stock he had broken over the head of those who were entering he had placed the billiard table between his assailants and himself he had retreated into the corner of the room and there with haughty eye and head borne high with this stump of a weapon in his hand he was still so alarming as to speedily create an empty space around him 
 a cry arose 
 he is the leader 
 it was he who slew the it is well that he has placed himself there 
 let him remain there let us shoot him down on the spot 
 shoot me said enjolras 
 and flinging away his bit of and folding his arms he offered his breast 
 the audacity of a fine death always affects men 
 as soon as enjolras folded his arms and accepted his end the din of strife ceased in the room and this chaos suddenly stilled into a sort of sepulchral solemnity 
 the menacing majesty of enjolras disarmed and motionless appeared to oppress this tumult and this young man haughty bloody and charming who alone had not a wound who was as indifferent as an invulnerable being seemed by the authority of his tranquil glance to constrain this sinister rabble to kill him respectfully 
 his beauty at that moment augmented by his pride was resplendent and he was fresh and rosy after the fearful four and twenty hours which had just elapsed as though he could no more be fatigued than wounded 
 it was of him possibly that a witness spoke afterwards before the council of war 
 there was an insurgent whom i heard called apollo a national guardsman who had taken aim at enjolras lowered his gun saying 
 it seems to me that i am about to shoot a flower 
 twelve men formed into a squad in the corner opposite enjolras and silently made ready their guns 
 then a sergeant shouted 
 take aim 
 an officer intervened 
 wait 
 and addressing enjolras 
 do you wish to have your eyes bandaged 
 no 
 was it you who killed the artillery sergeant 
 yes 
 grantaire had waked up a few moments before 
 grantaire it will be remembered had been asleep ever since the preceding evening in the upper room of the seated on a chair and leaning on the table 
 he realized in its fullest sense the old metaphor of dead drunk the hideous potion of and alcohol had thrown him into a lethargy 
 his table being small and not suitable for the barricade he had been left in possession of it he was still in the same posture with his breast bent over the table his head lying flat on his arms surrounded by glasses and bottles 
 his was the overwhelming slumber of the torpid bear and the satiated leech 
 nothing had had any effect upon it neither the fusillade nor the nor the which had made its way through the window into the room where he was nor the tremendous uproar of the assault 
 he merely replied to the cannonade now and then by a snore 
 he seemed to be waiting there for a bullet which should spare him the trouble of waking many corpses were strewn around him and at the first glance there was nothing to distinguish him from those profound sleepers of death 
 noise does not rouse a drunken man silence awakens him 
 the fall of everything around him only augmented prostration the crumbling of all things was his lullaby 
 the sort of halt which the tumult underwent in the presence of enjolras was a shock to this heavy slumber 
 it had the effect of a carriage going at full speed which suddenly comes to a dead stop 
 the persons dozing within it wake up 
 grantaire rose to his feet with a start stretched out his arms rubbed his eyes stared yawned and understood 
 a fit of drunkenness reaching its end resembles a curtain which is torn away 
 one beholds at a single glance and as a whole all that it has concealed 
 all suddenly presents itself to the memory and the drunkard who has known nothing of what has been taking place during the last hours has no sooner opened his eyes than he is perfectly informed 
 ideas recur to him with abrupt lucidity the obliteration of intoxication a sort of steam which has obscured the brain is dissipated and makes way for the clear and sharply outlined importunity of realities 
 relegated as he was to one corner and sheltered behind the the soldiers whose eyes were fixed on enjolras had not even noticed grantaire and the sergeant was preparing to repeat his order 
 take aim when all at once they heard a strong voice shout beside them 
 long live the republic 
 one of them 
 grantaire had risen 
 the immense gleam of the whole combat which he had missed and in which he had had no part appeared in the brilliant glance of the transfigured drunken man 
 he repeated 
 long live the republic crossed the room with a firm stride and placed himself in front of the guns beside enjolras 
 finish both of us at one blow said he 
 and turning gently to enjolras he said to him 
 do you permit it 
 enjolras pressed his hand with a smile 
 this smile was not ended when the report resounded 
 enjolras pierced by eight bullets remained leaning against the wall as though the balls had nailed him there 
 only his head was bowed 
 grantaire fell at his feet as though struck by a thunderbolt 
 a few moments later the soldiers dislodged the last remaining insurgents who had taken refuge at the top of the house 
 they fired into the attic through a wooden lattice 
 they fought under the very roof they flung bodies some of them still alive out through the windows two who tried to lift the shattered omnibus were slain by two shots fired from the attic 
 a man in a blouse was flung down from it with a bayonet wound in the abdomen and breathed his last on the ground 
 a soldier and an insurgent slipped together on the sloping slates of the roof and as they would not release each other they fell clasped in a ferocious embrace 
 a similar conflict went on in the cellar 
 shouts shots a fierce trampling then silence 
 the barricade was captured 
 the soldiers began to search the houses round about and to pursue the fugitives

 when the troops reached their halting place on the eighth of november the last day of the krasnoe battles it was already growing dusk all day it had been calm and frosty with occasional lightly falling snow and toward evening it began to clear through the falling snow a and starry sky showed itself and the frost grew keener 
 an infantry regiment which had left tarutino three thousand strong but now numbered only nine hundred was one of the first to arrive that night at its halting place a village on the highroad the quartermasters who met the regiment announced that all the huts were full of sick and dead frenchmen cavalrymen and members of the staff there was only one hut available for the regimental commander 
 the commander rode up to his hut the regiment passed through the village and stacked its arms in front of the last huts 
 like some huge animal the regiment began to prepare its lair and its food one part of it dispersed and waded through the snow into a birch forest to the right of the village and immediately the sound of axes and swords the crashing of branches and merry voices could be heard from there another section amid the regimental wagons and horses which were standing in a group was busy getting out caldrons and rye biscuit and feeding the horses a third section scattered through the village arranging quarters for the staff officers carrying out the french corpses that were in the huts and dragging away boards dry wood and thatch from the roofs for the campfires or wattle fences to serve for shelter 
 some fifteen men with merry shouts were shaking down the high wattle wall of a shed the roof of which had already been removed 
 now then all together shove cried the voices and the huge surface of the wall sprinkled with snow and creaking with frost was seen swaying in the gloom of the night the lower stakes cracked more and more and at last the wall fell and with it the men who had been pushing it loud coarse laughter and joyous shouts ensued 
 now then catch hold in twos hand up the lever it where are you shoving to 
 now all together but wait a moment boys with a song 
 all stood silent and a soft pleasant velvety voice began to sing at the end of the third verse as the last note died away twenty voices roared out at once it all together heave away boys but despite their united efforts the wattle hardly moved and in the silence that followed the heavy breathing of the men was audible 
 here you of the sixth company devils that you are lend a hand will you you may want us one of these days 
 some twenty men of the sixth company who were on their way into the village joined the haulers and the wattle wall which was about feet long an seven feet high moved forward along the village street swaying pressing upon and cutting the shoulders of the gasping men 
 get along falling what are you stopping for there now 
 merry senseless words of abuse flowed freely 
 what are you up to suddenly came the authoritative voice of a sergeant major who came upon the men who were hauling their burden there are gentry here the general himself is in that hut and you devils you brutes give it to you shouted he hitting the first man who came in his way a swinging blow on the back you make less noise 
 the men became silent the soldier who had been struck groaned and wiped his face which had been scratched till it bled by his falling against the wattle 
 there how that devil hits out made my face all bloody said he in a frightened whisper when the sergeant major had passed on 
 you like it said a laughing voice and moderating their tones the men moved forward 
 when they were out of the village they began talking again as loud as before interlarding their talk with the same aimless expletives 
 in the hut which the men had passed the chief officers had gathered and were in animated talk over their tea about the events of the day and the maneuvers suggested for tomorrow it was proposed to make a flank march to the left cut off the murat and capture him 
 by the time the soldiers had dragged the wattle fence to its place the campfires were blazing on all sides ready for cooking the wood crackled the snow was melting and black shadows of soldiers flitted to and fro all over the occupied space where the snow had been trodden down 
 axes and choppers were plied all around everything was done without any orders being given stores of wood were brought for the night shelters were rigged up for the officers caldrons were being boiled and muskets and accouterments put in order 
 the wattle wall the men had brought was set up in a semicircle by the eighth company as a shelter from the north propped up by musket rests and a campfire was built before it they beat the tattoo called the roll had supper and settled down round the fires for the night some repairing their footgear some smoking pipes and some stripping themselves naked to steam the lice out of their shirts

 prisoner 
 marius was in fact a prisoner 
 the hand which had seized him from behind and whose grasp he had felt at the moment of his fall and his loss of consciousness was that of jean valjean 
 jean valjean had taken no other part in the combat than to expose himself in it 
 had it not been for him no one in that supreme phase of agony would have thought of the wounded 
 thanks to him everywhere present in the carnage like a providence those who fell were picked up transported to the and cared for in the intervals he reappeared on the barricade 
 but nothing which could resemble a blow an attack or even personal defence proceeded from his hands 
 he held his peace and lent succor moreover he had received only a few scratches 
 the bullets would have none of him 
 if suicide formed part of what he had meditated on coming to this sepulchre to that spot he had not succeeded but we doubt whether he had thought of suicide an irreligious act 
 jean valjean in the thick cloud of the combat did not appear to see marius the truth is that he never took his eyes from the latter when a shot laid marius low jean valjean leaped forward with the agility of a tiger fell upon him as on his prey and bore him off 
 the whirlwind of the attack was at that moment so violently concentrated upon enjolras and upon the door of the that no one saw jean valjean sustaining the fainting marius in his arms traverse the unpaved field of the barricade and disappear behind the angle of the corinthe building 
 the reader will recall this angle which formed a sort of cape on the street it afforded shelter from the bullets the and all eyes and a few square feet of space 
 there is sometimes a chamber which does not burn in the midst of a conflagration and in the midst of raging seas beyond a promontory or at the extremity of a blind alley of shoals a tranquil nook 
 it was in this sort of fold in the interior trapezium of the barricade that eponine had breathed her last 
 there jean valjean halted let marius slide to the ground placed his back against the wall and cast his eyes about him 
 the situation was alarming 
 for an instant for two or three perhaps this bit of wall was a shelter but how was he to escape from this massacre 
 he recalled the anguish which he had suffered in the rue polonceau eight years before and in what manner he had contrived to make his escape it was difficult then it was impossible 
 he had before him that deaf and implacable house six stories in height which appeared to be inhabited only by a dead man leaning out of his window he had on his right the rather low barricade which shut off the rue de la petite truanderie to pass this obstacle seemed easy but beyond the crest of the barrier a line of bayonets was visible the troops of the line were posted on the watch behind that barricade it was evident that to pass the barricade was to go in quest of the fire of the platoon and that any head which should run the risk of lifting itself above the top of that wall of stones would serve as a target for sixty shots 
 on his left he had the field of battle death lurked round the corner of that wall 
 what was to be done 
 only a bird could have extricated itself from this predicament 
 and it was necessary to decide on the instant to devise some expedient to come to some decision 
 fighting was going on a few paces away fortunately all were raging around a single point the door of the but if it should occur to one soldier to one single soldier to turn the corner of the house or to attack him on the flank all was over 
 jean valjean gazed at the house facing him he gazed at the barricade at one side of him then he looked at the ground with the violence of the last extremity bewildered and as though he would have liked to pierce a hole there with his eyes 
 by dint of staring something vaguely striking in such an agony began to assume form and outline at his feet as though it had been a power of glance which made the thing desired unfold a few paces distant he perceived at the base of the small barrier so pitilessly guarded and watched on the exterior beneath a disordered mass of which partly concealed it an iron grating placed flat and on a level with the soil 
 this grating made of stout transverse bars was about two feet square the frame of which supported it had been torn up and it was as it were unfastened 
 through the bars a view could be had of a dark aperture something like the flue of a chimney or the pipe of a cistern jean valjean darted forward 
 his old art of escape rose to his brain like an illumination 
 to thrust aside the stones to raise the grating to lift marius who was as inert as a dead body upon his shoulders to descend with this burden on his loins and with the aid of his elbows and knees into that sort of well fortunately not very deep to let the heavy trap upon which the loosened stones rolled down afresh fall into its place behind him to gain his footing on a flagged surface three metres below the this was executed like that which one does in dreams with the strength of a giant and the rapidity of an eagle this took only a few minutes 
 jean valjean found himself with marius who was still unconscious in a sort of long subterranean corridor 
 there reigned profound peace absolute silence night 
 the impression which he had formerly experienced when falling from the wall into the convent recurred to him 
 only what he was carrying was not cosette it was marius 
 he could barely hear the formidable tumult in the taken by assault like a vague murmur overhead

 one would have thought that under the almost incredibly wretched conditions the russian soldiers were in at that time lacking warm boots and sheepskin coats without a roof over their heads in the snow with eighteen degrees of frost and without even full rations the commissariat did not always keep up with the troops they would have presented a very sad and depressing spectacle 
 on the contrary the army had never under the best material conditions presented a more cheerful and animated aspect this was because all who began to grow depressed or who lost strength were sifted out of the army day by day all the physically or morally weak had long since been left behind and only the flower of the army physically and mentally remained 
 more men collected behind the wattle fence of the eighth company than anywhere else two sergeants major were sitting with them and their campfire blazed brighter than others for leave to sit by their wattle they demanded contributions of fuel 
 eh makeev what has become of you you son of a bitch are you lost or have the wolves eaten you fetch some more wood shouted a and man screwing up his eyes and blinking because of the smoke but not moving back from the fire and you jackdaw go and fetch some wood said he to another soldier 
 this man was neither a sergeant nor a corporal but being robust he ordered about those weaker than himself the soldier they called jackdaw a thin little fellow with a sharp nose rose obediently and was about to go but at that instant there came into the light of the fire the slender handsome figure of a young soldier carrying a load of wood 
 bring it here fine 
 they split up the wood pressed it down on the fire blew at it with their mouths and fanned it with the skirts of their greatcoats making the flames hiss and crackle the men drew nearer and lit their pipes the handsome young soldier who had brought the wood setting his arms akimbo began stamping his cold feet rapidly and deftly on the spot where he stood 
 mother the dew is cold but clear well that a musketeer he sang pretending to hiccough after each syllable 
 look out your soles will fly off shouted the man noticing that the sole of the boot was hanging loose what a fellow you are for dancing 
 the dancer stopped pulled off the loose piece of leather and threw it on the fire 
 right enough friend said he and having sat down took out of his knapsack a scrap of blue french cloth and wrapped it round his foot the steam that spoils them he added stretching out his feet toward the fire 
 soon be issuing us new ones they say that when finished hammering them to receive double kits 
 and that son of a bitch petrov has lagged behind after all it seems said one sergeant major 
 had an eye on him this long while said the other 
 well a poor sort of soldier 
 but in the third company they say nine men were missing yesterday 
 yes all very well but when a feet are frozen how can he walk 
 eh talk nonsense said a sergeant major 
 do you want to be doing the same said an old soldier turning reproachfully to the man who had spoken of frozen feet 
 well you know said the man they called jackdaw in a squeaky and unsteady voice raising himself at the other side of the fire a plump man gets thin but for a thin one death take me now got no strength left he added with sudden resolution turning to the sergeant major tell them to send me to hospital aching all over anyway i be able to keep up 
 do do replied the sergeant major quietly 
 the soldier said no more and the talk went on 
 what a lot of those frenchies were taken today and the fact is that not one of them had what you might call real boots on said a soldier starting a new theme they were no more than 
 the cossacks have taken their boots they were clearing the hut for the colonel and carried them out it was pitiful to see them boys put in the dancer as they turned them over one seemed still alive and would you believe it he jabbered something in their lingo 
 but a clean folk lads the first man went on he was white as white as birchbark and some of them are such fine fellows you might think they were nobles 
 well what do you think they make soldiers of all classes there 
 but they understand our talk at all said the dancer with a puzzled smile i asked him whose subject he was and he jabbered in his own way a queer lot 
 but strange friends continued the man who had wondered at their whiteness the peasants at mozhaysk were saying that when they began burying the dead where the battle was you know well those dead had been lying there for nearly a month and says the peasant they lie as white as paper clean and not as much smell as a puff of powder smoke 
 was it from the cold asked someone 
 a clever fellow from the cold indeed why it was hot if it had been from the cold ours would not have rotted either but he says go up to ours and they are all rotten and maggoty so he says we tie our faces up with kerchiefs and turn our heads away as we drag them off we can hardly do it but theirs he says are white as paper and not so much smell as a whiff of gunpowder 
 all were silent 
 it must be from their food said the sergeant major they used to gobble the same food as the gentry 
 no one contradicted him 
 that peasant near mozhaysk where the battle was said the men were all called up from ten villages around and they carted for twenty days and still finish carting the dead away and as for the wolves he says 
 that was a real battle said an old soldier the only one worth remembering but since that only been tormenting folk 
 and do you know daddy the day before yesterday we ran at them and my word they let us get near before they just threw down their muskets and went on their knees pardon they say only one case they say platov took poleon himself twice but he know the right charm he catches him and catches him no good he turns into a bird in his hands and flies away and no way of killing him either 
 a liar kiselev when i come to look at you 
 liar indeed the real truth 
 if he fell into my hands when caught him bury him in the ground with an aspen stake to fix him down what a lot of men ruined 
 well anyhow going to end it he come here again remarked the old soldier yawning 
 the conversation flagged and the soldiers began settling down to sleep 
 look at the stars wonderful how they shine you would think the women had spread out their linen said one of the men gazing with admiration at the milky way 
 a sign of a good harvest next year 
 we shall want some more wood 
 you warm your back and your belly gets frozen queer 
 o lord 
 what are you pushing for is the fire only for you look how sprawling 
 in the silence that ensued the snoring of those who had fallen asleep could be heard others turned over and warmed themselves now and again exchanging a few words from a campfire a hundred paces off came a sound of general merry laughter 
 hark at them roaring there in the fifth company said one of the soldiers and what a lot of them there are 
 one of the men got up and went over to the fifth company 
 having such fun said he coming back two frenchies have turned up quite frozen and the an awful swaggerer singing songs 
 oh go across and have a look 
 and several of the men went over to the fifth company

 millions is the most moderate approximative figure which the valuations of special science have set upon it 
 science after having long groped about now knows that the most fecundating and the most efficacious of fertilizers is human manure the chinese let us confess it to our shame knew it before us not a chinese is eckberg who says to town without bringing back with him at the two extremities of his bamboo pole two full buckets of what we designate as filth 
 thanks to human dung the earth in china is still as young as in the days of abraham chinese wheat yields a hundred fold of the seed 
 there is no guano comparable in fertility with the detritus of a capital a great city is the most mighty of certain success would attend the experiment of employing the city to manure the plain 
 if our gold is manure our manure on the other hand is gold 
 what is done with this golden manure 
 it is swept into the abyss 
 fleets of vessels are despatched at great expense to collect the dung of petrels and penguins at the south pole and the incalculable element of opulence which we have on hand we send to the sea all the human and animal manure which the world wastes restored to the land instead of being cast into the water would suffice to nourish the world 
 those heaps of filth at the those tumbrils of mud which jolt through the street by night those terrible casks of the street department those fetid drippings of subterranean mire which the pavements hide from you know what they are they are the meadow in flower the green grass wild thyme thyme and sage they are game they are cattle they are the satisfied bellows of great oxen in the evening they are perfumed hay they are golden wheat they are the bread on your table they are the warm blood in your veins they are health they are joy they are life this is the will of that mysterious creation which is transformation on earth and transfiguration in heaven 
 restore this to the great crucible your abundance will flow forth from it 
 the nutrition of the plains furnishes the nourishment of men 
 you have it in your power to lose this wealth and to consider me ridiculous to boot 
 this will form the of your ignorance 
 statisticians have calculated that france alone makes a deposit of half a milliard every year in the atlantic through the mouths of her rivers 
 note this 
 with five hundred millions we could pay one quarter of the expenses of our budget 
 the cleverness of man is such that he prefers to get rid of these five hundred millions in the gutter 
 it is the very substance of the people that is carried off here drop by drop there wave after wave the wretched outpour of our sewers into the rivers and the gigantic collection of our rivers into the ocean 
 every hiccough of our sewers costs us a thousand francs 
 from this spring two results the land impoverished and the water tainted 
 hunger arising from the furrow and disease from the stream 
 it is notorious for example that at the present hour the thames is poisoning london 
 so far as paris is concerned it has become indispensable of late to transport the mouths of the sewers down stream below the last bridge 
 a double tubular apparatus provided with valves and sluices sucking up and driving back a system of elementary drainage simple as the lungs of a man and which is already in full working order in many communities in england would suffice to conduct the pure water of the fields into our cities and to send back to the fields the rich water of the cities and this easy exchange the simplest in the world would retain among us the five hundred millions now thrown away 
 people are thinking of other things 
 the process actually in use does evil with the intention of doing good the intention is good the result is melancholy 
 thinking to purge the city the population is blanched like plants raised in cellars a sewer is a mistake 
 when drainage everywhere with its double function restoring what it takes shall have replaced the sewer which is a simple impoverishing washing then this being combined with the data of a now social economy the product of the earth will be increased tenfold and the problem of misery will be singularly lightened 
 add the suppression of parasitism and it will be solved 
 in the meanwhile the public wealth flows away to the river and leakage takes place 
 leakage is the word 
 europe is being ruined in this manner by exhaustion 
 as for france we have just cited its figures 
 now paris contains one of the total population of france and parisian guano being the richest of all we understate the truth when we value the loss on the part of paris at millions in the half milliard which france annually rejects 
 these millions employed in assistance and enjoyment would double the splendor of paris 
 the city spends them in sewers 
 so that we may say that great prodigality its wonderful festival its beaujon folly its orgy its stream of gold from full hands its pomp its luxury its magnificence is its sewer system 
 it is in this manner that in the blindness of a poor political economy we drown and allow to float down stream and to be lost in the gulfs the of all 
 there should be nets at for the public fortune 
 economically considered the matter can be summed up thus paris is a spendthrift 
 paris that model city that patron of capitals of which every nation strives to possess a copy that metropolis of the ideal that august country of the initiative of impulse and of effort that centre and that dwelling of minds that that hive of the future that marvellous combination of babylon and corinth would make a peasant of the shrug his shoulders from the point of view which we have just indicated 
 imitate paris and you will ruin yourselves 
 moreover and particularly in this immemorial and senseless waste paris is itself an imitator 
 these surprising exhibitions of stupidity are not novel this is no young folly 
 the ancients did like the moderns the sewers of rome says liebig have absorbed all the of the roman peasant 
 when the campagna of rome was ruined by the roman sewer rome exhausted italy and when she had put italy in her sewer she poured in sicily then sardinia then africa the sewer of rome has engulfed the world 
 this offered its engulfment to the city and the universe 
 urbi et orbi eternal city unfathomable sewer 
 rome sets the example for these things as well as for others 
 paris follows this example with all the stupidity peculiar to intelligent towns 
 for the requirements of the operation upon the subject of which we have just explained our views paris has beneath it another paris a paris of sewers which has its streets its its squares its its arteries and its circulation which is of mire and minus the human form 
 for nothing must be flattered not even a great people where there is everything there is also ignominy by the side of sublimity and if paris contains athens the city of light tyre the city of might sparta the city of virtue nineveh the city of marvels it also contains lutetia the city of mud 
 however the stamp of its power is there also and the titanic sink of paris realizes among monuments that strange ideal realized in humanity by some men like macchiavelli bacon and mirabeau grandiose vileness 
 the of paris if the eye could penetrate its surface would present the aspect of a colossal madrepore 
 a sponge has no more partitions and ducts than the mound of earth for a circuit of six leagues round about on which rests the great and ancient city not to mention its catacombs which are a separate cellar not to mention the inextricable of gas pipes without reckoning the vast tubular system for the distribution of fresh water which ends in the pillar fountains the sewers alone form a tremendous shadowy under the two banks a labyrinth which has its slope for its guiding thread 
 there appears in the humid mist the rat which seems the product to which paris has given birth

 the fifth company was bivouacking at the very edge of the forest a huge campfire was blazing brightly in the midst of the snow lighting up the branches of trees heavy with hoarfrost 
 about midnight they heard the sound of steps in the snow of the forest and the crackling of dry branches 
 a bear lads said one of the men 
 they all raised their heads to listen and out of the forest into the bright firelight stepped two strangely clad human figures clinging to one another 
 these were two frenchmen who had been hiding in the forest they came up to the fire hoarsely uttering something in a language our soldiers did not understand one was taller than the other he wore an hat and seemed quite exhausted on approaching the fire he had been going to sit down but fell the other a short sturdy soldier with a shawl tied round his head was stronger he raised his companion and said something pointing to his mouth the soldiers surrounded the frenchmen spread a greatcoat on the ground for the sick man and brought some buckwheat porridge and vodka for both of them 
 the exhausted french officer was ramballe and the man with his head wrapped in the shawl was morel his orderly 
 when morel had drunk some vodka and finished his bowl of porridge he suddenly became unnaturally merry and chattered incessantly to the soldiers who could not understand him ramballe refused food and resting his head on his elbow lay silent beside the campfire looking at the russian soldiers with red and vacant eyes occasionally he emitted a groan and then again became silent morel pointing to his shoulders tried to impress on the soldiers the fact that ramballe was an officer and ought to be warmed a russian officer who had come up to the fire sent to ask his colonel whether he would not take a french officer into his hut to warm him and when the messenger returned and said that the colonel wished the officer to be brought to him ramballe was told to go he rose and tried to walk but staggered and would have fallen had not a soldier standing by held him up 
 you do it again eh said one of the soldiers winking and turning mockingly to ramballe 
 oh you fool why talk rubbish lout that you are a real peasant came rebukes from all sides addressed to the jesting soldier 
 they surrounded ramballe lifted him on the crossed arms of two soldiers and carried him to the hut ramballe put his arms around their necks while they carried him and began wailing plaintively 
 oh you fine fellows my kind kind friends these are men oh my brave kind friends and he leaned his head against the shoulder of one of the men like a child 
 meanwhile morel was sitting in the best place by the fire surrounded by the soldiers 
 morel a short sturdy frenchman with inflamed and streaming eyes was wearing a cloak and had a shawl tied woman fashion round his head over his cap he was evidently tipsy and was singing a french song in a hoarse broken voice with an arm thrown round the nearest soldier the soldiers simply held their sides as they watched him 
 now then now then teach us how it goes soon pick it up how is it said the man a singer and a wag whom morel was embracing 
 vive henri quatre vive ce roi valiant sang morel winking ce diable a quatre 
 long live henry the fourth that valiant king that rowdy devil 
 vivarika sedyablyaka repeated the soldier flourishing his arm and really catching the tune 
 bravo ha ha ha rose their rough joyous laughter from all sides 
 morel wrinkling up his face laughed too 
 well go on go on 
 qui eut le triple talent 
 de boire de battre 
 et un vert galant 
 who had a triple talent 
 for drinking for fighting 
 and for being a gallant old boy 
 it goes smoothly too well now zaletaev 
 ke zaletaev brought out with effort he drawled laboriously pursing his lips e he sang 
 fine just like the frenchie oh ho ho do you want some more to eat 
 give him some porridge it takes a long time to get filled up after starving 
 they gave him some more porridge and morel with a laugh set to work on his third bowl all the young soldiers smiled gaily as they watched him the older men who thought it undignified to amuse themselves with such nonsense continued to lie at the opposite side of the fire but one would occasionally raise himself on an elbow and glance at morel with a smile 
 they are men too said one of them as he wrapped himself up in his coat even wormwood grows on its own root 
 o lord o lord how starry it is tremendous that means a hard frost 
 they all grew silent the stars as if knowing that no one was looking at them began to disport themselves in the dark sky now flaring up now vanishing now trembling they were busy whispering something gladsome and mysterious to one another

 ancient history of the sewer 
 let the reader imagine paris lifted off like a cover the subterranean of sewers from a eye view will outline on the banks a species of large branch grafted on the river 
 on the right bank the belt sewer will form the trunk of this branch the secondary ducts will form the branches and those without exit the twigs 
 this figure is but a summary one and half exact the right angle which is the customary angle of this species of subterranean ramifications being very rare in vegetation 
 a more accurate image of this strange geometrical plan can be formed by supposing that one is viewing some eccentric oriental alphabet as intricate as a thicket against a background of shadows and the misshapen letters should be welded one to another in apparent confusion and as at haphazard now by their angles again by their extremities 
 sinks and sewers played a great part in the middle ages in the lower empire and in the orient of old 
 the masses regarded these beds of decomposition these monstrous cradles of death with a fear that was almost religious 
 the vermin ditch of benares is no less conducive to giddiness than the lions ditch of babylon according to the rabbinical books swore by the sink of nineveh 
 it was from the sewer of munster that john of leyden produced his false moon and it was from the of kekscheb that oriental menalchme mokanna the veiled prophet of khorassan caused his false sun to emerge 
 the history of men is reflected in the history of sewers the germoniae narrated rome 
 the sewer of paris has been an ancient and formidable thing 
 it has been a sepulchre it has served as an asylum 
 crime intelligence social protest liberty of conscience thought theft all that human laws persecute or have persecuted is hidden in that hole the maillotins in the fourteenth century the of the fifteenth the huguenots in the sixteenth illuminated in the seventeenth the chauffeurs brigands in the eighteenth 
 a hundred years ago the nocturnal blow of the dagger emerged thence the pickpocket in danger slipped thither the forest had its cave paris had its sewer vagrancy that gallic picareria accepted the sewer as the adjunct of the cour des miracles and at evening it returned thither fierce and sly through the maubuee outlet as into a 
 steps on the aventine hill leading to the tiber to which the bodies of executed criminals were dragged by hooks to be thrown into the tiber 
 it was quite natural that those who had the or the rue for the scene of their daily labor should have for their domicile by night the culvert of the or the catch basin of hurepoix hence a throng of souvenirs 
 all sorts of phantoms haunt these long solitary corridors everywhere is putrescence and miasma here and there are where villon within converses with rabelais without 
 the sewer in ancient paris is the rendezvous of all exhaustions and of all attempts 
 political economy therein spies a detritus social philosophy there beholds a residuum 
 the sewer is the conscience of the city 
 everything there converges and confronts everything else 
 in that livid spot there are shades but there are no longer any secrets each thing bears its true form or at least its definitive form the mass of filth has this in its favor that it is not a liar ingenuousness has taken refuge there 
 the mask of basil is to be found there but one beholds its cardboard and its strings and the inside as well as the outside and it is accentuated by honest mud false nose is its neighbor 
 all the uncleannesses of civilization once past their use fall into this trench of truth where the immense social sliding ends 
 they are there engulfed but they display themselves there 
 this mixture is a confession there no more false appearances no plastering over is possible filth removes its shirt absolute denudation puts to the rout all illusions and mirages there is nothing more except what really exists presenting the sinister form of that which is coming to an end there the bottom of a bottle indicates drunkenness a tells a tale of domesticity there the core of an apple which has entertained literary opinions becomes an once more the effigy on the big sou becomes frankly covered with verdigris caiphas spittle meets puking the which comes from the jostles the nail whence hangs the end of the suicide 
 a livid foetus rolls along enveloped in the spangles which danced at the opera last a cap which has pronounced judgment on men wallows beside a mass of rottenness which was formerly petticoat it is more than fraternization it is equivalent to addressing each other as thou 
 all which was formerly rouged is washed free 
 the last veil is torn away a sewer is a cynic 
 it tells everything 
 the sincerity of foulness pleases us and rests the soul 
 when one has passed time in enduring upon earth the spectacle of the great airs which reasons of state the oath political sagacity human justice professional probity the austerities of situation incorruptible robes all assume it solaces one to enter a sewer and to behold the mire which befits it 
 this is instructive at the same time 
 we have just said that history passes through the sewer 
 the filter through there drop by drop between the great public assassinations political and religious butcheries traverse this underground passage of civilization and thrust their corpses there 
 for the eye of the thinker all historic murderers are to be found there in that hideous penumbra on their knees with a scrap of their for an apron dismally sponging out their work louis xi 
 is there with tristan francois i with duprat charles ix is there with his mother richelieu is there with louis xiii louvois is there letellier is there hebert and maillard are there scratching the stones and trying to make the traces of their actions disappear 
 beneath these vaults one hears the brooms of spectres one there breathes the enormous fetidness of social catastrophes one beholds reddish reflections in the corners 
 there flows a terrible stream in which bloody hands have been washed 
 the social observer should enter these shadows 
 they form a part of his laboratory 
 philosophy is the microscope of the thought everything desires to flee from it but nothing escapes it tergiversation is useless 
 what side of oneself does one display in evasions the shameful side 
 philosophy pursues with its glance probes the evil and does not permit it to escape into nothingness in the obliteration of things which disappear in the watching of things which vanish it recognizes all 
 it reconstructs the purple from the rag and the woman from the scrap of her dress from the it the city from mud it reconstructs manners from the potsherd it infers the amphora or the jug 
 by the imprint of a on a piece of parchment it recognizes the difference which separates the jewry of the judengasse from the jewry of the ghetto 
 it in what remains that which has been good evil the true the of the palace the of the cavern the drop of sweat from the brothel trials undergone temptations welcomed orgies cast forth the turn which characters have taken as they became abased the trace of prostitution in souls of which their grossness rendered them capable and on the vesture of the porters of rome the mark of elbowing

 chapter x 
 
 the french army melted away at the uniform rate of a mathematical progression and that crossing of the berezina about which so much has been written was only one intermediate stage in its destruction and not at all the decisive episode of the campaign if so much has been and still is written about the berezina on the french side this is only because at the broken bridge across that river the calamities their army had been previously enduring were suddenly concentrated at one moment into a tragic spectacle that remained in every memory and on the russian side merely because in petersburg far from the seat of war a plan again one of had been devised to catch napoleon in a strategic trap at the berezina river everyone assured himself that all would happen according to plan and therefore insisted that it was just the crossing of the berezina that destroyed the french army in reality the results of the crossing were much less disastrous to the french in guns and men lost than krasnoe had been as the figures show 
 the sole importance of the crossing of the berezina lies in the fact that it plainly and indubitably proved the fallacy of all the plans for cutting off the retreat and the soundness of the only possible line of action the one kutuzov and the general mass of the army demanded namely simply to follow the enemy up the french crowd fled at a continually increasing speed and all its energy was directed to reaching its goal it fled like a wounded animal and it was impossible to block its path this was shown not so much by the arrangements it made for crossing as by what took place at the bridges when the bridges broke down unarmed soldiers people from moscow and women with children who were with the french transport all carried on by vis inertiae pressed forward into boats and into the water and did not surrender 
 that impulse was reasonable the condition of fugitives and of pursuers was equally bad as long as they remained with their own people each might hope for help from his fellows and the definite place he held among them but those who surrendered while remaining in the same pitiful plight would be on a lower level to claim a share in the necessities of life the french did not need to be informed of the fact that half the prisoners with whom the russians did not know what to do perished of cold and hunger despite their captors desire to save them they felt that it could not be otherwise the most compassionate russian commanders those favorable to the french and even the frenchmen in the russian service could do nothing for the prisoners the french perished from the conditions to which the russian army was itself exposed it was impossible to take bread and clothes from our hungry and indispensable soldiers to give to the french who though not harmful or hated or guilty were simply unnecessary some russians even did that but they were exceptions 
 certain destruction lay behind the french but in front there was hope their ships had been burned there was no salvation save in collective flight and on that the whole strength of the french was concentrated 
 the farther they fled the more wretched became the plight of the remnant especially after the berezina on which in consequence of the petersburg plan special hopes had been placed by the russians and the keener grew the passions of the russian commanders blamed one another and kutuzov most of all anticipation that the failure of the petersburg berezina plan would be attributed to kutuzov led to dissatisfaction contempt and ridicule more and more strongly expressed the ridicule and contempt were of course expressed in a respectful form making it impossible for him to ask wherein he was to blame they did not talk seriously to him when reporting to him or asking for his sanction they appeared to be fulfilling a regrettable formality but they winked behind his back and tried to mislead him at every turn 
 because they could not understand him all these people assumed that it was useless to talk to the old man that he would never grasp the profundity of their plans that he would answer with his phrases which they thought were mere phrases about a golden bridge about the impossibility of crossing the frontier with a crowd of tatterdemalions and so forth they had heard all that before and all he said that it was necessary to await provisions or that the men had no boots was so simple while what they proposed was so complicated and clever that it was evident that he was old and stupid and that they though not in power were commanders of genius 
 after the junction with the army of the brilliant admiral and petersburg hero wittgenstein this mood and the gossip of the staff reached their maximum kutuzov saw this and merely sighed and shrugged his shoulders only once after the affair of the berezina did he get angry and write to bennigsen who reported separately to the emperor the following letter 
 on account of your spells of ill health will your excellency please be so good as to set off for kaluga on receipt of this and there await further commands and appointments from his imperial majesty 
 but after departure the grand duke tsarevich constantine pavlovich joined the army he had taken part in the beginning of the campaign but had subsequently been removed from the army by kutuzov now having come to the army he informed kutuzov of the displeasure at the poor success of our forces and the slowness of their advance the emperor intended to join the army personally in a few days time 
 the old man experienced in court as well as in military affairs this same kutuzov who in august had been chosen commander in chief against the wishes and who had removed the grand duke and heir apparent from the army who on his own authority and contrary to the will had decided on the abandonment of moscow now realized at once that his day was over that his part was played and that the power he was supposed to hold was no longer his and he understood this not merely from the attitude of the court he saw on the one hand that the military business in which he had played his part was ended and felt that his mission was accomplished and at the same time he began to be conscious of the physical weariness of his aged body and of the necessity of physical rest 
 on the of november kutuzov entered vilna his dear vilna as he called it twice during his career kutuzov had been governor of vilna in that wealthy town which had not been injured he found old friends and associations besides the comforts of life of which he had so long been deprived and he suddenly turned from the cares of army and state and as far as the passions that seethed around him allowed immersed himself in the quiet life to which he had formerly been accustomed as if all that was taking place and all that had still to be done in the realm of history did not concern him at all 
 chichagov one of the most zealous and who had first wanted to effect a diversion in greece and then in warsaw but never wished to go where he was sent chichagov noted for the boldness with which he spoke to the emperor and who considered kutuzov to be under an obligation to him because when he was sent to make peace with turkey in independently of kutuzov and found that peace had already been concluded he admitted to the emperor that the merit of securing that peace was really this chichagov was the first to meet kutuzov at the castle where the latter was to stay in undress naval uniform with a dirk and holding his cap under his arm he handed kutuzov a garrison report and the keys of the town the contemptuously respectful attitude of the younger men to the old man in his dotage was expressed in the highest degree by the behavior of chichagov who knew of the accusations that were being directed against kutuzov 
 when speaking to chichagov kutuzov incidentally mentioned that the vehicles packed with china that had been captured from him at borisov had been recovered and would be restored to him 
 you mean to imply that i have nothing to eat out of on the contrary i can supply you with everything even if you want to give dinner parties warmly replied chichagov who tried by every word he spoke to prove his own rectitude and therefore imagined kutuzov to be animated by the same desire 
 kutuzov shrugging his shoulders replied with his subtle penetrating smile i meant merely to say what i said 
 contrary to the wish kutuzov detained the greater part of the army at vilna those about him said that he became extraordinarily slack and physically feeble during his stay in that town he attended to army affairs reluctantly left everything to his generals and while awaiting the arrival led a dissipated life 
 having left petersburg on the seventh of december with his suite count tolstoy prince volkonski arakcheev and others the emperor reached vilna on the eleventh and in his traveling sleigh drove straight to the castle in spite of the severe frost some hundred generals and staff officers in full parade uniform stood in front of the castle as well as a guard of honor of the semenov regiment 
 a courier who galloped to the castle in advance in a troyka with three horses shouted coming and konovnitsyn rushed into the vestibule to inform kutuzov who was waiting in the hall little lodge 
 a minute later the old large stout figure in uniform his chest covered with orders and a scarf drawn round his stomach waddled out into the porch he put on his hat with its peaks to the sides and holding his gloves in his hand and walking with an effort sideways down the steps to the level of the street took in his hand the report he had prepared for the emperor 
 there was running to and fro and whispering another troyka furiously up and then all eyes were turned on an approaching sleigh in which the figures of the emperor and volkonski could already be descried 
 from the habit of fifty years all this had a physically agitating effect on the old general he carefully and hastily felt himself all over readjusted his hat and pulling himself together drew himself up and at the very moment when the emperor having alighted from the sleigh lifted his eyes to him handed him the report and began speaking in his smooth ingratiating voice 
 the emperor with a rapid glance scanned kutuzov from head to foot frowned for an instant but immediately mastering himself went up to the old man extended his arms and embraced him and this embrace too owing to a impression related to his innermost feelings had its usual effect on kutuzov and he gave a sob 
 the emperor greeted the officers and the semenov guard and again pressing the old hand went with him into the castle 
 when alone with the field marshal the emperor expressed his dissatisfaction at the slowness of the pursuit and at the mistakes made at krasnoe and the berezina and informed him of his intentions for a future campaign abroad kutuzov made no rejoinder or remark the same submissive expressionless look with which he had listened to the commands on the field of austerlitz seven years before settled on his face now 
 when kutuzov came out of the study and with lowered head was crossing the ballroom with his heavy waddling gait he was arrested by voice saying 
 your serene highness 
 kutuzov raised his head and looked for a long while into the eyes of count tolstoy who stood before him holding a silver salver on which lay a small object kutuzov seemed not to understand what was expected of him 
 suddenly he seemed to remember a scarcely perceptible smile flashed across his puffy face and bowing low and respectfully he took the object that lay on the salver it was the order of st george of the first class

 the sewer of paris in the middle ages was legendary 
 in the sixteenth century henri ii 
 attempted a bore which failed not a hundred years ago the mercier attests the fact was abandoned to itself and fared as best it might 
 such was this ancient paris delivered over to quarrels to indecision and to gropings 
 it was tolerably stupid for a long time later on showed how understanding comes to cities 
 but in the good old times the capital had not much head 
 it did not know how to manage its own affairs either morally or materially and could not sweep out filth any better than it could abuses everything presented an obstacle everything raised a question the sewer for example was refractory to every itinerary one could no more find bearings in the sewer than one could understand position in the city above the unintelligible below the inextricable beneath the confusion of tongues there reigned the confusion of caverns daedalus backed up babel 
 sometimes the paris sewer took a notion to overflow as though this misunderstood nile were suddenly seized with a fit of rage there occurred infamous to relate inundations of the sewer at times that stomach of civilization digested badly the flowed back into the throat of the city and paris got an of her own filth 
 these resemblances of the sewer to remorse had their good points they were warnings very badly accepted however the city waxed indignant at the audacity of its mire and did not admit that the filth should return 
 drive it out better 
 the inundation of is one of the actual memories of parisians of the age of eighty 
 the mud spread in over the place des victoires where stands the statue of louis xiv it entered the rue by the two mouths to the sewer in the the rue through the sewer the rue through the sewer de la sonnerie the rue popincourt through the sewer of the the rue de la roquette through the sewer of the rue de lappe it covered the drain of the rue des to the height of centimetres and to the south through the vent of the seine performing its functions in inverse sense it penetrated the rue mazarine the rue de and the rue des marais where it stopped at a distance of one hundred and nine metres a few paces distant from the house in which racine had lived respecting in the seventeenth century the poet more than the king it attained its maximum depth in the rue where it rose to the height of three feet above the of the and its maximum length in the rue where it spread out over a stretch two hundred and metres in length 
 at the beginning of this century the sewer of paris was still a mysterious place 
 mud can never enjoy a good fame but in this case its evil renown reached the verge of the terrible 
 paris knew in a confused way that she had under her a terrible cavern people talked of it as of that monstrous bed of thebes in which swarmed centipedes fifteen long feet in length and which might have served behemoth for a bathtub 
 the great boots of the sewermen never ventured further than certain points 
 we were then very near the epoch when the carts from the summit of which fraternized with the marquis de crequi discharged their loads directly into the sewer 
 as for cleaning out that function was entrusted to the pouring rains which encumbered rather than swept away 
 rome left some poetry to her sewer and called it the gemoniae paris insulted hers and entitled it the science and superstition were in accord in horror the polypus hole was no less repugnant to hygiene than to legend the goblin was developed under the fetid covering of the mouffetard sewer the corpses of the marmousets had been cast into the sewer de la barillerie fagon attributed the redoubtable malignant fever of to the great hiatus of the sewer of the marais which remained yawning until in the rue almost opposite the sign of the gallant messenger 
 the mouth of the sewer of the rue de la mortellerie was celebrated for the pestilences which had their source there with its grating of iron with points simulating a row of teeth it was like a maw in that fatal street breathing forth hell upon men 
 the popular imagination seasoned the sombre parisian sink with some indescribably hideous intermixture of the infinite the sewer had no bottom 
 the sewer was the lower world 
 the idea of exploring these leprous regions did not even occur to the police to try that unknown thing to cast the plummet into that shadow to set out on a voyage of discovery in that would have dared it was alarming 
 nevertheless some one did present himself the had its christopher columbus 
 one day in during one of the rare apparitions which the emperor made in paris the minister of the interior some decres or cretet or other came to the intimate levee in the carrousel there was audible the clanking of swords of all those extraordinary soldiers of the great republic and of the great empire then door was blocked with heroes men from the rhine from the escaut from the adige and from the nile companions of joubert of desaix of marceau of hoche of kleber the aerostiers of fleurus the grenadiers of mayence the of genoa hussars whom the pyramids had looked down upon artillerists whom had spattered with mud cuirassiers who had taken by assault the fleet lying at anchor in the zuyderzee some had followed bonaparte upon the bridge of lodi others had accompanied murat in the trenches of mantua others had preceded lannes in the hollow road of montebello the whole army of that day was present there in the of the tuileries represented by a squadron or a platoon and guarding napoleon in repose and that was the splendid epoch when the grand army had marengo behind it and austerlitz before said the minister of the interior to napoleon yesterday i saw the most intrepid man in your man is that said the emperor brusquely and what has he wants to do something is visit the sewers of paris 
 this man existed and his name was bruneseau

 next day the field marshal gave a dinner and ball which the emperor honored by his presence kutuzov had received the order of st george of the first class and the emperor showed him the highest honors but everyone knew of the imperial dissatisfaction with him the proprieties were observed and the emperor was the first to set that example but everybody understood that the old man was blameworthy and when kutuzov conforming to a custom of day ordered the standards that had been captured to be lowered at the feet on his entering the ballroom the emperor made a wry face and muttered something in which some people caught the words the old comedian 
 the displeasure with kutuzov was specially increased at vilna by the fact that kutuzov evidently could not or would not understand the importance of the coming campaign 
 when on the following morning the emperor said to the officers assembled about him you have not only saved russia you have saved europe they all understood that the war was not ended 
 kutuzov alone would not see this and openly expressed his opinion that no fresh war could improve the position or add to the glory of russia but could only spoil and lower the glorious position that russia had gained he tried to prove to the emperor the impossibility of levying fresh troops spoke of the hardships already endured by the people of the possibility of failure and so forth 
 this being the field frame of mind he was naturally regarded as merely a hindrance and obstacle to the impending war 
 to avoid unpleasant encounters with the old man the natural method was to do what had been done with him at austerlitz and with barclay at the beginning of the russian campaign to transfer the authority to the emperor himself thus cutting the ground from under the commander in feet without upsetting the old man by informing him of the change 
 with this object his staff was gradually reconstructed and its real strength removed and transferred to the emperor toll konovnitsyn and ermolov received fresh appointments everyone spoke loudly of the field great weakness and failing health 
 his health had to be bad for his place to be taken away and given to another and in fact his health was poor 
 so naturally simply and gradually just as he had come from turkey to the treasury in petersburg to recruit the militia and then to the army when he was needed there now when his part was played out place was taken by a new and necessary performer 
 the war besides its national significance dear to every russian heart was now to assume another a european significance 
 the movement of peoples from west to east was to be succeeded by a movement of peoples from east to west and for this fresh war another leader was necessary having qualities and views differing from and animated by different motives 
 alexander i was as necessary for the movement of the peoples from east to west and for the refixing of national frontiers as kutuzov had been for the salvation and glory of russia 
 kutuzov did not understand what europe the balance of power or napoleon meant he could not understand it for the representative of the russian people after the enemy had been destroyed and russia had been liberated and raised to the summit of her glory there was nothing left to do as a russian nothing remained for the representative of the national war but to die and kutuzov died

 the visit took place 
 it was a formidable campaign a nocturnal battle against pestilence and suffocation 
 it was at the same time a voyage of discovery 
 one of the survivors of this expedition an intelligent workingman who was very young at the time related curious details with regard to it several years ago which bruneseau thought himself obliged to omit in his report to the prefect of police as unworthy of official style 
 the processes of disinfection were at that epoch extremely rudimentary 
 hardly had bruneseau crossed the first articulations of that subterranean network when eight laborers out of the twenty refused to go any further 
 the operation was complicated the visit entailed the necessity of cleaning hence it was necessary to cleanse and at the same time to proceed to note the entrances of water to count the gratings and the vents to lay out in detail the branches to indicate the currents at the point where they parted to define the respective bounds of the divers basins to sound the small sewers grafted on the principal sewer to measure the height under the of each drain and the width at the spring of the vaults as well as at the bottom in order to determine the arrangements with regard to the level of each either of the bottom of the arch or on the soil of the street 
 they advanced with toil 
 the lanterns pined away in the foul atmosphere 
 from time to time a fainting sewerman was carried out 
 at certain points there were precipices the soil had given away the pavement had crumbled the sewer had changed into a bottomless well they found nothing solid a man disappeared suddenly they had great difficulty in getting him out again 
 on the advice of fourcroy they lighted large cages filled with tow steeped in resin from time to time in spots which had been sufficiently disinfected 
 in some places the wall was covered with misshapen would have said tumors the very stone seemed diseased within this unbreathable atmosphere 
 bruneseau in his exploration proceeded down hill 
 at the point of separation of the two of the he deciphered upon a projecting stone the date of this stone indicated the limits where philibert delorme charged by henri ii with visiting the subterranean drains of paris had halted this stone was the mark of the sixteenth century on the sewer bruneseau found the handiwork of the seventeenth century once more in the ponceau drain of the old rue vaulted between and and the handiwork of the eighteenth in the western section of the collecting canal walled and vaulted in these two vaults especially the less ancient that of were more cracked and decrepit than the masonry of the belt sewer which dated from an epoch when the brook of fresh water of menilmontant was elevated to the dignity of the grand sewer of paris an advancement analogous to that of a peasant who should become first valet de chambre to the king something like transformed into lebel 
 here and there particularly beneath the they thought they recognized the hollows of ancient dungeons excavated in the very sewer itself 
 hideous an iron was hanging in one of these cells 
 they walled them all up 
 some of their finds were singular among others the skeleton of an who had disappeared from the jardin des plantes in a disappearance probably connected with the famous and indisputable apparition of the devil in the rue des bernardins in the last year of the eighteenth century 
 the poor devil had ended by drowning himself in the sewer 
 beneath this long arched drain which terminated at the a perfectly preserved basket excited the admiration of all connoisseurs 
 everywhere the mire which the sewermen came to handle with intrepidity abounded in precious objects jewels of gold and silver precious stones coins 
 if a giant had filtered this cesspool he would have had the riches of centuries in his lair at the point where the two branches of the rue du temple and of the rue separate they picked up a singular huguenot medal in copper bearing on one side the pig hooded with a hat and on the other a wolf with a tiara on his head 
 the most surprising rencounter was at the entrance to the grand sewer this entrance had formerly been closed by a grating of which nothing but the hinges remained 
 from one of these hinges hung a dirty and shapeless rag which arrested there in its passage no doubt had floated there in the darkness and finished its process of being torn apart 
 bruneseau held his lantern close to this rag and examined it 
 it was of very fine batiste and in one of the corners less frayed than the rest they made out a heraldic coronet and embroidered above these seven letters 
 lavbesp 
 the crown was the coronet of a marquis and the seven letters signified laubespine they recognized the fact that what they had before their eyes was a morsel of the shroud of marat 
 marat in his youth had had amorous intrigues 
 this was when he was a member of the household of the comte in the capacity of physician to the stables from these love affairs historically proved with a great lady he had retained this sheet 
 as a waif or a souvenir 
 at his death as this was the only linen of any fineness which he had in his house they buried him in it 
 some old women had shrouded him for the tomb in that in which the tragic friend of the people had enjoyed voluptuousness 
 bruneseau passed on 
 they left that rag where it hung they did not put the finishing touch to it did this arise from scorn or from respect 
 marat deserved both and then destiny was there sufficiently stamped to make them hesitate to touch it 
 besides the things of the sepulchre must be left in the spot which they select 
 in short the relic was a strange one 
 a marquise had slept in it marat had rotted in it it had traversed the pantheon to end with the rats of the sewer this chamber rag of which watteau would formerly have joyfully sketched every fold had ended in becoming worthy of the fixed gaze of dante 
 the whole visit to the subterranean stream of filth of paris lasted seven years from to 
 as he proceeded bruneseau drew directed and completed considerable works in he lowered the arch of the ponceau and everywhere creating new lines he pushed the sewer in under the rue as far as the fountain of the innocents in under the rue froidmanteau and under the salpetriere in under the rue under the rue du mail under the rue de under the place royale in under the rue de la paix and under the chaussee at the same time he had the whole disinfected and rendered healthful 
 in the second year of his work bruneseau engaged the assistance of his nargaud 
 it was thus that at the beginning of the century ancient society cleansed its double bottom and performed the toilet of its sewer there was that much clean at all events 
 tortuous cracked unpaved full of fissures intersected by gullies jolted by eccentric elbows mounting and descending illogically fetid wild fierce submerged in obscurity with cicatrices on its pavements and scars on its walls was retrospectively viewed the antique sewer of paris 
 ramifications in every direction crossings of trenches branches stars as in military mines coecum blind alleys vaults lined with saltpetre pestiferous pools scabby sweats on the walls drops dripping from the ceilings darkness nothing could equal the horror of this old waste crypt the digestive apparatus of babylon a cavern ditch gulf pierced with streets a titanic where the mind seems to behold that enormous blind mole the past prowling through the shadows in the filth which has been splendor 
 this we repeat was the sewer of the past

 book fifteen 
 chapter xii 
 
 as generally happens pierre did not feel the full effects of the physical privation and strain he had suffered as prisoner until after they were over after his liberation he reached orel and on the third day there when preparing to go to kiev he fell ill and was laid up for three months he had what the doctors termed bilious fever but despite the fact that the doctors treated him bled him and gave him medicines to drink he recovered 
 scarcely any impression was left on mind by all that happened to him from the time of his rescue till his illness he remembered only the dull gray weather now rainy and now snowy internal physical distress and pains in his feet and side he remembered a general impression of the misfortunes and sufferings of people and of being worried by the curiosity of officers and generals who questioned him he also remembered his difficulty in procuring a conveyance and horses and above all he remembered his incapacity to think and feel all that time on the day of his rescue he had seen the body of petya rostov that same day he had learned that prince andrew after surviving the battle of borodino for more than a month had recently died in the rostovs house at yaroslavl and denisov who told him this news also mentioned death supposing that pierre had heard of it long before all this at the time seemed merely strange to pierre he felt he could not grasp its significance just then he was only anxious to get away as quickly as possible from places where people were killing one another to some peaceful refuge where he could recover himself rest and think over all the strange new facts he had learned but on reaching orel he immediately fell ill when he came to himself after his illness he saw in attendance on him two of his servants terenty and vaska who had come from moscow and also his cousin the eldest princess who had been living on his estate at elets and hearing of his rescue and illness had come to look after him 
 it was only gradually during his convalescence that pierre lost the impressions he had become accustomed to during the last few months and got used to the idea that no one would oblige him to go anywhere tomorrow that no one would deprive him of his warm bed and that he would be sure to get his dinner tea and supper but for a long time in his dreams he still saw himself in the conditions of captivity in the same way little by little he came to understand the news he had been told after his rescue about the death of prince andrew the death of his wife and the destruction of the french 
 a joyous feeling of freedom that complete inalienable freedom natural to man which he had first experienced at the first halt outside moscow filled soul during his convalescence he was surprised to find that this inner freedom which was independent of external conditions now had as it were an additional setting of external liberty he was alone in a strange town without acquaintances no one demanded anything of him or sent him anywhere he had all he wanted the thought of his wife which had been a continual torment to him was no longer there since she was no more 
 oh how good how splendid said he to himself when a cleanly laid table was moved up to him with savory beef tea or when he lay down for the night on a soft clean bed or when he remembered that the french had gone and that his wife was no more oh how good how splendid 
 and by old habit he asked himself the question well and what then what am i going to do and he immediately gave himself the answer well i shall live ah how splendid 
 the very question that had formerly tormented him the thing he had continually sought to find the aim of life no longer existed for him now that search for the aim of life had not merely disappeared temporarily he felt that it no longer existed for him and could not present itself again and this very absence of an aim gave him the complete joyous sense of freedom which constituted his happiness at this time 
 he could not see an aim for he now had faith not faith in any kind of rule or words or ideas but faith in an god formerly he had sought him in aims he set himself that search for an aim had been simply a search for god and suddenly in his captivity he had learned not by words or reasoning but by direct feeling what his nurse had told him long ago that god is here and everywhere in his captivity he had learned that in karataev god was greater more infinite and unfathomable than in the architect of the universe recognized by the freemasons he felt like a man who after straining his eyes to see into the far distance finds what he sought at his very feet all his life he had looked over the heads of the men around him when he should have merely looked in front of him without straining his eyes 
 in the past he had never been able to find that great inscrutable infinite something he had only felt that it must exist somewhere and had looked for it in everything near and comprehensible he had only what was limited petty commonplace and senseless he had equipped himself with a mental telescope and looked into remote space where petty worldliness hiding itself in misty distance had seemed to him great and infinite merely because it was not clearly seen and such had european life politics freemasonry philosophy and philanthropy seemed to him but even then at moments of weakness as he had accounted them his mind had penetrated to those distances and he had there seen the same pettiness worldliness and senselessness now however he had learned to see the great eternal and infinite in everything and therefore to see it and enjoy its contemplation he naturally threw away the telescope through which he had till now gazed over heads and gladly regarded the eternally great unfathomable and infinite life around him and the closer he looked the more tranquil and happy he became that dreadful question what for which had formerly destroyed all his mental edifices no longer existed for him to that question what for a simple answer was now always ready in his soul because there is a god that god without whose will not one hair falls from a head

 of discourse 
 some in their discourse desire rather commendation of wit in being able to hold 
 all arguments than of judgment in discerning what is true as if it were a praise 
 to know what might be said and not what should be thought some have certain common places and themes wherein they are good and want variety which kind of poverty is for the most part tedious and when it is once perceived ridiculous 
 the honourablest part of talk is to give the occasion and again to moderate and pass to somewhat else for then a man leads the dance it is good in discourse and speech of conversation to vary and intermingle speech of the present occasion with arguments tales with reasons asking of questions with telling of opinions and jest with earnest for it is a dull thing to tire and as we say now to jade anything too far 
 as for jest there be certain things which ought to be privileged from it namely religion matters of state great persons any present business of 
 importance and any case mat deserveth pity yet there be some that think their wits have been asleep except they dart out somewhat that is piquant and to the quick that is a vein which would be bridled stimulis et fortius utere ions 
 and generally men ought to find the difference between saltness and bitterness 
 certainly he that hath a satyrical vein as he maketh others afraid of his wit so 
 he had need be afraid of others memory he that questioned much shall learn much and content much but especially if he apply his questions to the skill of the persons whom he asketh for he shall give them occasion to please themselves in speaking and himself shall continually gather knowledge but let his questions not be troublesome for that is fit for a poser and let him be sure to leave other men 
 their turns to speak nay if there be any that would reign and take up all the 
 time let him find means to take them off and to bring others on as musicians use 
 to do with those that dance too long galliards if you dissemble sometimes your 
 knowledge of that you are thought to know you shall be thought another time to 
 know that you know not speech of a self ought to be seldom and well chosen 
 
 i knew one was wont to say in scorn he must needs be a wise man he speaks so much of himself and there is but one case wherein a man may commend himself with good grace and that is in commending virtue in another especially if it be such a virtue whereunto himself pretendeth speech of touch towards others should be sparingly used for discourse ought to be as a field without coming home to any man i knew two noblemen of the west part of england whereof 
 the one was given to scoff but kept ever royal cheer in his house the other would 
 ask of those that had been at the table tell truly was there never a flout 
 or dry blow given to which the guest would answer 
 such and such a thing passed the lord would say i thought he would mar a good dinner discretion of speech is more than eloquence and to speak agreeably to him with whom we deal is more than to speak in good words or in good order a good continued speech without a good speech of interlocution shows slowness and a good reply or second speech without a good settled speech showeth shallowness and weakness as we see in beasts that those that are weakest in the course are yet nimblest in the turn as it is betwixt the greyhound and the hare to use too many circumstances ere one come to the matter is wearisome to use none at all is blunt

 book the year 
 chapter iv 
 
 tholomyes is so merry that he sings a spanish ditty 
 that day was composed of dawn from one end to the nature seemed to be having a holiday and to be of perfumed the air the breath of the seine rustled the leaves vaguely the branches gesticulated in the wind bees pillaged the jasmines a whole bohemia of butterflies swooped down upon the yarrow the clover and the sterile oats in the august park of the king of france there was a pack of vagabonds the birds 
 the four merry couples mingled with the sun the fields the flowers the trees were resplendent 
 and in this community of paradise talking singing running dancing chasing butterflies plucking convolvulus wetting their pink stockings in the tall grass fresh wild without malice all received to some extent the kisses of all with the exception of fantine who was hedged about with that vague resistance of hers composed of dreaminess and wildness and who was in always have a queer look about you said favourite to her 
 such things are joys 
 these passages of happy couples are a profound appeal to life and nature and make a caress and light spring forth from everything 
 there was once a fairy who created the fields and forests expressly for those in that eternal of lovers which is forever beginning anew and which will last as long as there are hedges and the popularity of spring among thinkers 
 the patrician and the the duke and the peer the limb of the law the courtiers and townspeople as they used to say in olden times all are subjects of this fairy 
 they laugh and hunt and there is in the air the brilliance of an a transfiguration effected by love 
 notaries clerks are gods 
 and the little cries the pursuits through the grass the waists embraced on the fly those jargons which are melodies those adorations which burst forth in the manner of pronouncing a syllable those cherries torn from one mouth by this blazes forth and takes its place among the celestial glories 
 beautiful women waste themselves sweetly 
 they think that this will never come to an poets painters observe these ecstasies and know not what to make of it so greatly are they dazzled by it 
 the departure for cythera exclaims watteau lancret the painter of plebeians contemplates his bourgeois who have flitted away into the azure sky diderot stretches out his arms to all these love idyls and mingles druids with them 
 after breakfast the four couples went to what was then called the square to see a newly arrived plant from india whose name escapes our memory at this moment and which at that epoch was attracting all paris to it was an odd and charming shrub with a long stem whose numerous branches bristling and leafless and as fine as threads were covered with a million tiny white rosettes this gave the shrub the air of a head of hair studded with was always an admiring crowd about it 
 after viewing the shrub tholomyes exclaimed i offer you asses and having agreed upon a price with the owner of the asses they returned by way of vanvres and issy 
 at issy an incident truly national park at that time owned by bourguin the contractor happened to be wide open 
 they passed the gates visited the manikin anchorite in his grotto tried the mysterious little effects of the famous cabinet of mirrors the wanton trap worthy of a satyr become a millionaire or of turcaret metamorphosed into a had stoutly shaken the swing attached to the two celebrated by the abbe de bernis 
 as he swung these beauties one after the other producing folds in the fluttering skirts which greuze would have found to his taste amid peals of laughter the toulousan tholomyes who was somewhat of a spaniard toulouse being the cousin of tolosa sang to a melancholy chant the old ballad gallega probably inspired by some lovely maid dashing in full flight upon a rope between two trees 
 soy de badajoz 
 badajoz is my home 
 amor me llama 
 and love is my name 
 toda mi alma 
 to my eyes in flame 
 es en mi ojos 
 all my soul doth come 
 porque ensenas 
 for instruction meet 
 a tuas piernas 
 i receive at thy feet 
 fantine alone refused to swing 
 i like to have people put on airs like that muttered favourite with a good deal of acrimony 
 after leaving the asses there was a fresh delight they crossed the seine in a boat and proceeding from passy on foot they reached the barrier of they had been up since five that morning as the reader will remember but bah there is no such thing as fatigue on sunday said favourite on sunday fatigue does not work 
 about three the four couples frightened at their happiness were sliding down the russian mountains a singular edifice which then occupied the heights of beaujon and whose undulating line was visible above the trees of the champs elysees 
 from time to time favourite exclaimed 
 and the surprise 
 i claim the surprise 
 patience replied tholomyes

 return of the jedi 
 iii 
 
 the sandstorm obscured breath thought motion the roar of italone was disorienting sounding like it came from everywhere at once as if theuniverse were composed of noise and this was its chaotic center 
 the seven heroes walked step by step through the murky gale holding on to oneanother so as not to get lost artoo was first following the signal of the homingdevice which sang to him in a language not garbled by the wind threepio camenext then leia guiding han and finally luke and lando supporting the hobblingwookiee 
 artoo beeped loudly and they all looked up vague dark shapes could be seenthrough the typhoon 
 i know shouted han all i can see is a lot of blowing sand 
 all any of us can see leia shouted back 
 then i guess getting better 
 for a few steps the dark shapes grew darker and then out of the darkness themillennium falcon appeared flanked by and a soon as the group huddled under the bulk of the falcon the wind died down tosomething more describable as a severe weather condition threepio hit a the gangplank lowered with a hum 
 solo turned to skywalker got to hand it to you kid you were pretty goodout there 
 luke shrugged it off i had a lot of help he started toward his 
 han stopped him his manner suddenly quieter even serious thanks forcoming after me luke 
 luke felt embarrassed for some reason he know how to respond toanything but a wisecrack from the old pirate think nothing of it he finally said 
 no thinkin a lot about it that carbon freeze was the closest thing todead there is and it just sleepin it was a big wide awake nothin 
 a nothing from which luke and the others had saved their own livesin great peril at his expense for no other reason than thathe was their friend thiswas a new idea for the cocky once terrible and wonderful there wasjeopardy in this turn of events it made him feel somehow blinder than before butvisionary as well it was confusing once he was alone now he was a part 
 that realization made him feel indebted a feeling always abhorred onlynow the debt was somehow a new kind of bond a bond of brotherhood it was evenfreeing in a strange way 
 he was no longer so alone 
 no longer alone 
 luke saw a difference had come over his friend like a sea change it was agentle moment he want to disturb it so he only nodded 
 chewie growled affectionately at the young jedi warrior mussing his hair like aproud uncle and leia warmly hugged him 
 they all had great love for solo but somehow it was easier to show it by beingdemonstrative to luke 
 see you back at the fleet luke called moving toward his ship 
 why you leave that crate and come with us solo nudged 
 i have a promise i have to keep firstto an old fried a very old friend hesmiled to himself in afterthought 
 well hurry back leia urged the entire alliance should be assembled bynow she saw something in face she put a name to it but it scaredher and simultaneously made her feel closer to him hurry back she repeated 
 i will he promised come on artoo 
 artoo rolled toward the beeping a farewell to threepio 
 artoo threepio called out fondly may the maker bless will watch out for him you master luke 
 but luke and the little droid were already gone on the far end of the flyer 
 the others stood without moving for a moment trying to see their futures in theswirling sand 
 lando jarred them awake come on get off this miserable dirt luck here had been abominable he hoped to fare better in the next game itwould be house rules for a while he knew but he might be able to load a few dicealong the way 
 solo clapped him on the back guess i owe you some thanks too lando 
 figured if i left you frozen like that just give me bad luck the rest of mylife so i might as well get you unfrozen sooner as later 
 he means welcome leia smiled we all mean kissed han on the cheek to say it personally one more time 
 they all headed up the ramp of the falcon solo paused just before goinginside and gave the ship a little pat lookin good old girl i never live to see you again 
 he entered at last closing the hatch behind him 
 luke did the same in the he strapped himself into the cockpit startedup the engines felt the comfortable roar he looked at his damaged hand wirescrossed aluminum bones like spokes in a puzzle he wondered what the solutionwas or the puzzle for that matter he pulled a black glove over the exposedinfrastructure set the controls and for the second time in his life herocketed off his home planet into the stars 
 the super star destroyer rested in space above the death starbattle station and its green neighbor endor the destroyer was a massive by numerous smaller warships of various kinds which hovered or dartedaround the great mother ship like children of different ages and range fleet cruisers bulky cargo vessels tie fighter escorts 
 the main bay of the destroyer opened an imperial shuttleemerged and accelerated toward the death star accompanied by four squads offighters 
 darth vader watched their approach on the viewscreen in the control room of thedeath star when docking was imminent he marched out of the command by commander jerjerrod and a phalanx of imperial stormtroopers andheaded toward the docking bay he was about to welcome his master 
 pulse and breathing were so they could not something in his chest became more electric around his meetings with theemperor he could not say how a feeling of fullness unrestrained passion these things were in heart as he neared his emperor thesethings and more 
 when he entered the docking bay thousands of imperial troops snapped toattention with a momentous clap the shuttle came to rest on the pod its ramplowered like a dragon jaw and the royal guard ran down red robesflapping as if they were licks of flame shooting out the mouth to herald the angry poised themselves at watchful guard in two lethal rows beside the filled the great hall at the top of the ramp the emperor appeared 
 slowly he walked down a small man was he shriveled with age and supported his bent frame on a gnarled cane and covered himself with a like the robe of the jedi only black his shrouded face was sothin of flesh it was nearly a skull his piercing yellow eyes seemed to burn through allat which they stared 
 when the emperor reached the bottom of the ramp commander jerjerrod hisgenerals and lord vader all kneeled before him the supreme dark rulerbeckoned to vader and began walking down the row of troops 
 rise my friend i would talk with you 
 vader rose and accompanied his master they were followed in procession bythe courtiers the royal guard jerjerrod and the death star elite mixed reverence and fear 
 vader felt complete at the side though the emptiness at his corenever left him it became a glorious emptiness in the glare of the cold exalted void that could encompass the universe and someday would encompassthe universewhen the emperor was dead 
 for that was final dream when learned all he could of the darkpower from this evil genius to take that power from seize it and keep its cold light athis own the emperor and devour his darkness and rule the universe rulewith his son at his side 
 for that was his other reclaim his boy to show luke the majesty ofthis shadow force why it was so potent why chosen rightly to follow its luke would come with him he knew that seed was sown they would ruletogether father and son 
 his dream was very close to realization he could feel it it was near eachevent fell into place as nudged it with jedi subtlety as pressed withdelicate dark strength 
 the death star will be completed on schedule my master vader breathed 
 yes i know replied the emperor you have done well lord vaderandnow i sense you wish to continue your search for the young skywalker 
 vader smiled beneath his armored mask the emperor always knew the senseof what was in his heart even if he know the specifics yes my master 
 patience my friend the supreme ruler cautioned you always haddifficulty showing patience in time he will seek you outand when he does youmust bring him before me he has grown strong only together can we turn him tothe dark side of the force 
 yes my master together they would corrupt the child of thefather great dark glory for soon the old emperor would though thegalaxy would bend from the horror of that loss vader would remain to rule withyoung skywalker at his side as it was always meant to be 
 the emperor raised his head a degree scanning all the possible is proceeding as i have foreseen 
 he like vader had plans of his of spiritual violation themanipulation of lives and destinies he chuckled to himself savoring the nearnessof his conquest the final seduction of the young skywalker 
 luke left his parked at the edge of the water and carefully picked hisway through the adjoining swamp a heavy mist hung in layers about him junglesteam a strange insect flew at him from out of a cluster of hanging vines flutteredmadly about his head and vanished in the undergrowth something snarled lukeconcentrated momentarily the snarling stopped luke walked on 
 he had terribly ambivalent feelings about this place dagobah his place oftests of training to be a jedi this was where truly learned to use the force tolet it flow through him to whatever end he directed it so learned howcaretaking he must be in order to use the force well it was walking on light but toa jedi it was as stable as an earthen floor 
 dangerous creatures lurked in this swamp but to a jedi none were quicksand mires waited still as pools tentacles mingled with the hangingvines luke knew them all now they were all part of the living planet each integralto the force of which he too was a pulsing aspect 
 yet there were dark things here as dark reflections of thedark corners of his soul seen these things here run from them with them even faced them vanquished some of them 
 but some still cowered here these dark things 
 he climbed around a barricade of gnarled roots slippery with moss on theother side a smooth unimpeded path led straight in the direction he wanted to go buthe did not take it instead he plunged once more into the undergrowth 
 high overhead something black and flapping approached then veered paid no attention he just kept walking 
 the jungle thinned a bit beyond the next bog luke saw dwelling its odd little windows shedding a warm yellow light in thedamp he skirted the mire and crouching low entered the cottage 
 yoda stood smiling inside his small green hand clutching his walking stick forsupport waiting for you i was he nodded 
 he motioned luke to sit in a corner the boy was struck by how much morefrail manner tremor to the hand a weakness to the voice it madeluke afraid to speak to betray his shock at the old condition 
 that face you make yoda crinkled his tired brow cheerfully look i so badto young eyes 
 he tried to conceal his woeful countenance shifting his position in the crampedspace no masterof course not 
 i do yes i do the tiny jedi master chuckled gleefully sick old and weak he pointed a crooked finger at his young pupil whennine hundred years old you reach look as good you will not 
 the creature hobbled over to his bed still chuckling and with great effort laydown soon will i rest yes forever sleep earned it i have 
 luke shook his head you die master let you 
 trained well and strong with the force are not that strong twilightis upon me and soon night must fall that is the way of thingsthe way of theforce 
 but i need your help luke insisted i want to complete my training thegreat teacher leave him was too much still to understand taken so much from yoda already and as yet given back nothing he had muchhe wanted to share with the old creature 
 no more training do you require yoda assured him already know you thatwhich you need 
 then i am a jedi luke pressed no he knew he was not still lacked 
 yoda wrinkled up his wizened features not yet one thing you must confront then only then a full jedi be andconfront him you will sooner or later 
 luke knew this would be his test it could not be otherwise every quest had itfocus and vader was inextricably at the core of struggle it was agonizingfor him to put the question to words but after a long silence he again spoke to the oldjedi master darth vader my father 
 eyes filled with a weary compassion this boy was not yet a mancomplete a sad smile creased his face he seemed almost to grow smaller in his rest i need yes a rest 
 luke stared at the dwindling teacher trying to give the old one strength just bythe force of his love and will yoda i must know he whispered 
 your father he is yoda said simply 
 luke closed his eyes his mouth his heart to keep away the truth of what heknew was true 
 told you did he yoda asked 
 luke nodded but did not speak he wanted to keep the moment frozen toshelter it here to lock time and space in this room so it could never escape into therest of the universe with this terrible knowledge this unrelenting truth 
 a look of concern filled face unexpected this is and unfortunate 
 unfortunate that i know the truth a bitterness crept into voice buthe decide if it was directed at vader yoda himself or the universe at large 
 yoda gathered himself up with an effort that seemed to take all his that you rushed to face incomplete your training wasthatnot ready for the burden were you would have told you long ago had i lethimnow a great weakness you carry fear for you i do fear for you yes agreat tension seemed to pass out of him and he closed his eyes 
 master yoda i am sorry luke trembled to see the potent jedi so weak 
 i know but face vader again you must and sorry will not help he leanedforward and beckoned luke close to him luke crawled over to sit beside hismaster yoda continued his voice increasingly frail remember a strengthflows from the force when you rescued your friends you had revenge in yourheart beware of anger fear and aggression the dark side are they easily theyflow quick to join you in a fight once you start down the dark path forever will itdominate your destiny 
 he lay back in bed his breathing became shallow luke waited quietly afraidto move afraid to distract the old one an iota lest it jar his attention even a fractionfrom the business of just keeping the void at bay 
 after a few minutes yoda looked at the boy once more and with a maximumeffort smiled gently the greatness of his spirit the only thing keeping his decrepitbody alive the emperor beware do not underestimate his powers orsuffer your fate you will when gone i amlast of the jedi will you the force is strong in your family pass on what youhavelearned hebegan to falter he closed his eyes thereisanothersky 
 he caught his breath and exhaled his spirit passing from him like a sunny windblowing to another sky his body shivered once and he disappeared 
 luke sat beside the small empty bed for over an hour trying to fathom the depthof this loss it was unfathomable 
 his first feeling was one of boundless grief for himself for the could such a one as yoda be gone forever it felt like a black bottomless holehad filled his heart where the part that was yoda had lived 
 luke had know the passing of old mentor before it was helplessly sad andinexorably a part of his own growing is this what coming of age was beloved friends grow old and die gaining a new measure of strength ormaturity from their powerful passages 
 a great weight of hopelessness settled upon him just as all the lights in the littlecottage flickered out for several more minutes he sat there feeling it was the end ofeverything that all the lights in the universe had flickered out the last jedi sittingin a swamp while the entire galaxy plotted the last war 
 a chill came over him though disturbing the nothingness into which hisconsciousness had lapsed he shivered looked around the gloom wasimpenetrable 
 he crawled outside and stood up here in the swamp nothing had congealed to drip from dangling roots back into the mire in a cycle it hadrepeated a million times would repeated forever perhaps there was his lesson ifso it cut his sadness not a whit 
 aimlessly he made his way back to where his ship rested artoo rushed his excited greetings but luke was disconsolate and could only ignore thefaithful little droid artoo whistled a brief condolence then remained respectfullysilent 
 luke sat dejectedly on a log put his head in his hands and spoke softly tohimself i do it i go on alone 
 a voice floated down to him on the dim mist yoda and i will be with youalways it was voice 
 luke turned around swiftly to see the shimmering image of kenobistanding behind him ben he whispered there were so many things he wantedto say they rushed through his mind all in a whirl like the churning puffed cargo of aship in a maelstrom but one question rose quickly to the surface above all theothers why ben why you tell me 
 it was not an empty question i was going to tell you when you had completedyour training the vision of ben answered but you found it necessary to rush offunprepared i warned you about your impatience his voice was unchanged ahint of scolding a hint of love 
 you told me darth vader betrayed and murdered my father the felt earlier with yoda had found its focus now on ben 
 ben absorbed the vitriol undefensively then padded it with instruction yourfather anakin was seduced by the dark side of the ceased to be anakinskywalker and became darth vader when that happened he betrayed everythingthat anakin skywalker believed in the good man who was your father wasdestroyed so what i told you was truefrom a certain point of view 
 a certain point of view luke rasped derisively he felt lifemore than anything else though only poor ben was available to take the brunt of hisconflict 
 luke ben spoke gently going to find that many of the truth we clingto depend greatly on our point of view 
 luke turned unresponsive he wanted to hold onto his fury to guard it like atreasure it was all he had he would not let it be stolen from him as everything elsehad been stolen but already he felt it slipping softened by compassionatetouch 
 i blame you for being angry ben coaxed if i was wrong in what i certainly have been for the first time you see what happened to yourfather was my fault 
 luke looked up with sudden acute interest never heard this and wasrapidly losing his anger to fascination and knowledge was an addictivedrug and the more he had the more he wanted 
 as he sat on his stump increasingly mesmerized artoo pedaled over silent justto offer a comforting presence 
 when i first encountered your father ben continued he was already a greatpilot but what amazed me was how strongly the force was with him i took itupon myself to train anakin in the ways of the jedi my mistake was thinking icould be as good a teacher as yoda i was not such was my foolish pride theemperor sensed power and he lured him to the dark side he pausedsadly and looked directly into eyes as if he were asking for the my pride had terrible consequences for the galaxy 
 luke was entranced that hubris could have caused his fallwas horrible horrible because of what his father had needlessly become horriblebecause perfect even a perfect jedi horrible because the darkside could strike so close to him could turn such right so wring darth vader mustyet have a spark of anakin skywalker deep inside there is still good in him hedeclared 
 ben shook his head remorsefully i also thought he could be turned back to thegood side it be done he is more machine now than andevil 
 luke sensed the underlying meaning in statement he heard the wordsas a command he shook his head back at the vision i kill my own father 
 you should not think of that machine as your father it was the teacherspeaking again when i saw what had become of him i tried to dissuade him todraw him back from the dark side we foughtyour father fell into a molten your father clawed his way out of that fiery pool the change had been burnedinto him was darth vader without a trace of anakin dark scarred kept alive only by machinery and his own blackwill 
 luke looked down at his own mechanical right hand i tried to stop him do it he would not challenge his father again he could not 
 vader humbled you when first you met him that experience waspart of your training it taught you among other things the value of patience hadyou not been so impatient to defeat vader then you could have finished your traininghere with yoda you would have been prepared 
 but i had to help my friends 
 and did you help them it was they who had to save you you achievedlittle by rushing back prematurely i fear 
 indignation melted leaving only sadness in its wake i found out darthvader was my father he whispered 
 to be a jedi luke you must confront and then go beyond the dark your father get past impatience is the easiest you like yourfather only your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the you have held firm no longer so reckless now luke you are strongand patient and you are ready for your final confrontation 
 luke shook his head again as the implications of the old speech becameclear i do it ben 
 shoulders slumped in defeat then the emperor has alreadywon you were our only hope 
 luke reached for alternatives yoda said i could train another to 
 the other he spoke of is your twin sister the old man offered a dry will find it no easier than you to destroy darth vader 
 luke was visibly jolted by this information he stood up to face this i have a sister 
 once again put a gentle inflection in his voice to soothe the turmoilbrewing in his young soul to protect you both against the emperor youwere separated when you were born the emperor knew as i did that one day withthe force on their side offspring would be a threat to him for thatreason your sister has remained safely anonymous 
 luke resisted this knowledge at first he neither needed nor wanted a was unique he had no missing the hand whose mechanicalreplacement he now flexed tightly pawn in a castle conspiracy cribs switched and parted and whisked away to different secret lives knew who he was he was luke skywalker born to a on a tatooine sandfarm by uncle owen and aunt beru raised in a life withoutfrills a hardworking honest his motherhis motherwhat was itabout his mother what had she said who was she what had she told him heturned his mind inward to a place and time far from the damp soil of dagobah to chamber his mother and hissister his sister 
 leia leia is my sister he exclaimed nearly falling over the stump 
 your insight serves you well ben nodded he quickly became stern your feelings deep down luke they do you credit but they could be madeto serve the emperor 
 luke tried to comprehend what his old teacher was saying so muchinformation so fast so vitalit almost made him swoon 
 ben continued his narrative when your father left he know yourmother was pregnant your mother and i knew he would find out eventually but wewanted to keep you both as safe as possible for as long as possible so i took you tolive with my brother owen on tatooineand your mother took leia to live as thedaughter of senator organa on alderaan 
 luke settled down to hear this tale as artoo nestled up beside him humming ina subaudible register to comfort 
 ben too kept his voice even so that the sounds could give solace when thewords did not the organa family was and politically quite powerful inthat system leia became a princess by virtue of one knew beenadopted of course but it was a title without real power since alderaan had longbeen a democracy even so the family continued to be politically powerful andleia following in her foster path became a senator as well not allshe became of became the leader of her cell in the alliance against thecorrupt empire and because she had diplomatic immunity she was a vital link forgetting information to the rebel cause 
 what she was doing when her path crossed her foster parentshad always told her to contact me on tatooine if her troubles became desperate 
 luke tried sorting through his multiplicity of love always feltfor leia even from afar now had a clear basis but suddenly he was feelingprotective toward her as well like an older though for all he knew shemight have been his elder by several minutes 
 but you let her get involved now ben he insisted vader will destroyher vader their father perhaps leia could resurrect the good in him 
 she been trained in the ways of the jedi the way you have theforce is strong with her as it is with all of your family that is why her path the force in her must be nourished by a jedi the last lukebut she returned to learn and grow because it was herdestiny to learn and grow and mine to teach 
 he went on more slowly each word deliberate each pause emphatic youcannot escape your destiny luke he locked his eyes on eyes and put asmuch of his spirit as he could into the gaze to leave it forever imprinted on keep your identity secret for if you fail she is truly our last on me now coming fight is yours alone but much will depend on itsoutcome and it may be that you can draw some strength from my memory there isno avoiding the battle escape your destiny you will have to facedarth vader again

 book two 
 chapter iv 
 
 the pavlograd hussars were stationed two miles from braunau the squadron in which nicholas rostov served as a cadet was quartered in the german village of salzeneck the best quarters in the village were assigned to denisov the squadron commander known throughout the whole cavalry division as vaska denisov cadet rostov ever since he had overtaken the regiment in poland had lived with the squadron commander 
 on october the day when all was astir at headquarters over the news of defeat the camp life of the officers of this squadron was proceeding as usual denisov who had been losing at cards all night had not yet come home when rostov rode back early in the morning from a foraging expedition rostov in his cadet uniform with a jerk to his horse rode up to the porch swung his leg over the saddle with a supple youthful movement stood for a moment in the stirrup as if loathe to part from his horse and at last sprang down and called to his orderly 
 ah bondarenko dear friend said he to the hussar who rushed up headlong to the horse walk him up and down my dear fellow he continued with that gay brotherly cordiality which goodhearted young people show to everyone when they are happy 
 yes your excellency answered the ukrainian gaily tossing his head 
 mind walk him up and down well 
 another hussar also rushed toward the horse but bondarenko had already thrown the reins of the snaffle bridle over the head it was evident that the cadet was liberal with his tips and that it paid to serve him rostov patted the neck and then his flank and lingered for a moment 
 splendid what a horse he will be he thought with a smile and holding up his saber his spurs jingling he ran up the steps of the porch his landlord who in a waistcoat and a pointed cap pitchfork in hand was clearing manure from the cowhouse looked out and his face immediately brightened on seeing rostov schon gut morgen schon gut morgen he said winking with a merry smile evidently pleased to greet the young man 
 a very good morning a very good morning 
 schon fleissig said rostov with the same gay brotherly smile which did not leave his eager face hoch oestreicher hoch russen kaiser alexander hoch said he quoting words often repeated by the german landlord 
 busy already 
 hurrah for the austrians hurrah for the russians hurrah for emperor alexander 
 the german laughed came out of the cowshed pulled off his cap and waving it above his head cried 
 und die ganze welt hoch 
 and hurrah for the whole world 
 rostov waved his cap above his head like the german and ctied laughing und vivat die ganze welt though neither the german cleaning his cowshed nor rostov back with his platoon from foraging for hay had any reason for rejoicing they looked at each other with joyful delight and brotherly love wagged their heads in token of their mutual affection and parted smiling the german returning to his cowshed and rostov going to the cottage he occupied with denisov 
 what about your master he asked lavrushka orderly whom all the regiment knew for a rogue 
 been in since the evening must have been losing answered lavrushka i know by now if he wins he comes back early to brag about it but if he stays out till morning it means lost and will come back in a rage will you have coffee 
 yes bring some 
 ten minutes later lavrushka brought the coffee coming said he now for trouble rostov looked out of the window and saw denisov coming home denisov was a small man with a red face sparkling black eyes and black tousled mustache and hair he wore an unfastened cloak wide breeches hanging down in creases and a crumpled shako on the back of his head he came up to the porch gloomily hanging his head 
 lavwuska he shouted loudly and angrily take it off blockhead 
 well i am taking it off replied voice 
 ah up already said denisov entering the room 
 long ago answered rostov i have already been for the hay and have seen fraulein mathilde 
 weally and been losing bwother i lost yesterday like a damned fool cried denisov not pronouncing his such ill luck such ill luck as soon as you left it began and went on hullo there tea 
 puckering up his face though smiling and showing his short strong teeth he began with stubby fingers of both hands to ruffle up his thick tangled black hair 
 and what devil made me go to that wat an officer nicknamed the rat he said rubbing his forehead and whole face with both hands just fancy he let me win a single cahd not one cahd 
 he took the lighted pipe that was offered to him gripped it in his fist and tapped it on the floor making the sparks fly while he continued to shout 
 he lets one win the singles and collahs it as soon as one doubles it gives the singles and snatches the doubles 
 he scattered the burning tobacco smashed the pipe and threw it away then he remained silent for a while and all at once looked cheerfully with his glittering black eyes at rostov 
 if at least we had some women here but nothing foh one to do but dwink if we could only get to fighting soon hullo there he said turning to the door as he heard a tread of heavy boots and the clinking of spurs that came to a stop and a respectful cough 
 the squadron quartermaster said lavrushka 
 face puckered still more 
 wetched he muttered throwing down a purse with some gold in it wostov deah fellow just see how much there is left and shove the purse undah the pillow he said and went out to the quartermaster 
 rostov took the money and mechanically arranging the old and new coins in separate piles began counting them 
 ah telyanin how do they plucked me last night came voice from the next room 
 where at at the i knew it replied a piping voice and lieutenant telyanin a small officer of the same squadron entered the room 
 rostov thrust the purse under the pillow and shook the damp little hand which was offered him telyanin for some reason had been transferred from the guards just before this campaign he behaved very well in the regiment but was not liked rostov especially detested him and was unable to overcome or conceal his groundless antipathy to the man 
 well young cavalryman how is my rook behaving he asked rook was a young horse telyanin had sold to rostov 
 the lieutenant never looked the man he was speaking to straight in the face his eyes continually wandered from one object to another 
 i saw you riding this morning he added 
 oh all right a good horse answered rostov though the horse for which he had paid seven hundred rubbles was not worth half that sum begun to go a little lame on the left foreleg he added 
 the cracked nothing teach you what to do and show you what kind of rivet to use 
 yes please do said rostov 
 show you show you not a secret and a horse thank me for 
 then have it brought round said rostov wishing to avoid telyanin and he went out to give the order 
 in the passage denisov with a pipe was squatting on the threshold facing the quartermaster who was reporting to him on seeing rostov denisov screwed up his face and pointing over his shoulder with his thumb to the room where telyanin was sitting he frowned and gave a shudder of disgust 
 ugh i like that fellow he said regardless of the presence 
 rostov shrugged his shoulders as much as to say nor do i but one to do and having given his order he returned to telyanin 
 telyanin was sitting in the same indolent pose in which rostov had left him rubbing his small white hands 
 well there certainly are disgusting people thought rostov as he entered 
 have you told them to bring the horse asked telyanin getting up and looking carelessly about him 
 i have 
 let us go ourselves i only came round to ask denisov about order have you got it denisov 
 not yet but where are you off to 
 i want to teach this young man how to shoe a horse said telyanin 
 they went through the porch and into the stable the lieutenant explained how to rivet the hoof and went away to his own quarters 
 when rostov went back there was a bottle of vodka and a sausage on the table denisov was sitting there scratching with his pen on a sheet of paper he looked gloomily in face and said i am witing to her 
 he leaned his elbows on the table with his pen in his hand and evidently glad of a chance to say quicker in words what he wanted to write told rostov the contents of his letter 
 you see my fwiend he said we sleep when we love we are childwen of the dust but one falls in love and one is a god one is pua as on the first day of cweation that now send him to the devil busy he shouted to lavrushka who went up to him not in the least abashed 
 who should it be you yourself told him to come the quartermaster for the money 
 denisov frowned and was about to shout some reply but stopped 
 wetched business he muttered to himself how much is left in the puhse he asked turning to rostov 
 seven new and three old imperials 
 oh wetched well what are you standing there for you call the quahtehmasteh he shouted to lavrushka 
 please denisov let me lend you some i have some you know said rostov blushing 
 like bowwowing from my own fellows i growled denisov 
 but if you accept money from me like a comrade you will offend me really i have some rostov repeated 
 no i tell you 
 and denisov went to the bed to get the purse from under the pillow 
 where have you put it wostov 
 under the lower pillow 
 not there 
 denisov threw both pillows on the floor the purse was not there 
 a miwacle 
 wait you dropped it said rostov picking up the pillows one at a time and shaking them 
 he pulled off the quilt and shook it the purse was not there 
 dear me can i have forgotten no i remember thinking that you kept it under your head like a treasure said rostov i put it just here where is it he asked turning to lavrushka 
 i been in the room it must be where you put it 
 but it 
 always like that you thwow a thing down anywhere and forget it feel in your pockets 
 no if i thought of it being a treasure said rostov but i remember putting it there 
 lavrushka turned all the bedding over looked under the bed and under the table searched everywhere and stood still in the middle of the room denisov silently watched movements and when the latter threw up his arms in surprise saying it was nowhere to be found denisov glanced at rostov 
 wostov not been playing schoolboy twicks 
 rostov felt gaze fixed on him raised his eyes and instantly dropped them again all the blood which had seemed congested somewhere below his throat rushed to his face and eyes he could not draw breath 
 and there been anyone in the room except the lieutenant and yourselves it must be here somewhere said lavrushka 
 now then you puppet look alive and hunt for it shouted denisov suddenly turning purple and rushing at the man with a threatening gesture if the purse found flog you flog you all 
 rostov his eyes avoiding denisov began buttoning his coat buckled on his saber and put on his cap 
 i must have that purse i tell you shouted denisov shaking his orderly by the shoulders and knocking him against the wall 
 denisov let him alone i know who has taken it said rostov going toward the door without raising his eyes denisov paused thought a moment and evidently understanding what rostov hinted at seized his arm 
 nonsense he cried and the veins on his forehead and neck stood out like cords you are mad i tell you i allow it the purse is here flay this scoundwel alive and it will be found 
 i know who has taken it repeated rostov in an unsteady voice and went to the door 
 and i tell you you dahe to do it shouted denisov rushing at the cadet to restrain him 
 but rostov pulled away his arm and with as much anger as though denisov were his worst enemy firmly fixed his eyes directly on his face 
 do you understand what saying he said in a trembling voice there was no one else in the room except myself so that if it is not so then 
 he could not finish and ran out of the room 
 ah may the devil take you and evewybody were the last words rostov heard 
 rostov went to quarters 
 the master is not in gone to headquarters said orderly has something happened he added surprised at the troubled face 
 no nothing 
 only just missed him said the orderly 
 the headquarters were situated two miles away from salzeneck and rostov without returning home took a horse and rode there there was an inn in the village which the officers frequented rostov rode up to it and saw horse at the porch 
 in the second room of the inn the lieutenant was sitting over a dish of sausages and a bottle of wine 
 ah come here too young man he said smiling and raising his eyebrows 
 yes said rostov as if it cost him a great deal to utter the word and he sat down at the nearest table 
 both were silent there were two germans and a russian officer in the room no one spoke and the only sounds heard were the clatter of knives and the munching of the lieutenant 
 when telyanin had finished his lunch he took out of his pocket a double purse and drawing its rings aside with his small white fingers drew out a gold imperial and lifting his eyebrows gave it to the waiter 
 please be quick he said 
 the coin was a new one rostov rose and went up to telyanin 
 allow me to look at your purse he said in a low almost inaudible voice 
 with shifting eyes but eyebrows still raised telyanin handed him the purse 
 yes a nice purse yes yes he said growing suddenly pale and added look at it young man 
 rostov took the purse in his hand examined it and the money in it and looked at telyanin the lieutenant was looking about in his usual way and suddenly seemed to grow very merry 
 if we get to vienna get rid of it there but in these wretched little towns nowhere to spend it said he well let me have it young man going 
 rostov did not speak 
 and you are you going to have lunch too they feed you quite decently here continued telyanin now then let me have it 
 he stretched out his hand to take hold of the purse rostov let go of it telyanin took the purse and began carelessly slipping it into the pocket of his riding breeches with his eyebrows lifted and his mouth slightly open as if to say yes yes i am putting my purse in my pocket and quite simple and is no business 
 well young man he said with a sigh and from under his lifted brows he glanced into eyes 
 some flash as of an electric spark shot from eyes to and back and back again and again in an instant 
 come here said rostov catching hold of arm and almost dragging him to the window that money is you took it he whispered just above ear 
 what what how dare you what said telyanin 
 but these words came like a piteous despairing cry and an entreaty for pardon as soon as rostov heard them an enormous load of doubt fell from him he was glad and at the same instant began to pity the miserable man who stood before him but the task he had begun had to be completed 
 heaven only knows what the people here may imagine muttered telyanin taking up his cap and moving toward a small empty room we must have an explanation 
 i know it and shall prove it said rostov 
 i 
 every muscle of pale terrified face began to quiver his eyes still shifted from side to side but with a downward look not rising to face and his sobs were audible 
 count ruin a young fellow here is this wretched money take it he threw it on the table i have an old father and mother 
 rostov took the money avoiding eyes and went out of the room without a word but at the door he stopped and then retraced his steps o god he said with tears in his eyes how could you do it 
 count said telyanin drawing nearer to him 
 touch me said rostov drawing back if you need it take the money and he threw the purse to him and ran out of the inn

 chapter 
 
 
 this september i was invited to devastate the moors of a friend in the north and on my journey to his abode i unexpectedly came within fifteen miles of gimmerton the ostler at a roadside public house was holding a pail of water to refresh my horses when a cart of very green oats newly reaped passed by and he remarked 
 frough gimmerton nah allas three wick after other folk wi ther harvest 
 gimmerton i residence in that locality had already grown dim and dreamy ah i know how far is it from this 
 happen fourteen mile th hills and a rough road he answered 
 a sudden impulse seized me to visit thrushcross grange it was scarcely noon and i conceived that i might as well pass the night under my own roof as in an inn besides i could spare a day easily to arrange matters with my landlord and thus save myself the trouble of invading the neighbourhood again having rested a while i directed my servant to inquire the way to the village and with great fatigue to our beasts we managed the distance in some three hours 
 i left him there and proceeded down the valley alone the grey church looked greyer and the lonely churchyard lonelier i distinguished a moor sheep cropping the short turf on the graves it was sweet warm warm for travelling but the heat did not hinder me from enjoying the delightful scenery above and below had i seen it nearer august sure it would have tempted me to waste a month among its solitudes in winter nothing more dreary in summer nothing more divine than those glens shut in by hills and those bluff bold swells of heath 
 i reached the grange before sunset and knocked for admittance but the family had retreated into the back premises i judged by one thin blue wreath curling from the kitchen chimney and they did not hear i rode into the court under the porch a girl of nine or ten sat knitting and an old woman reclined on the house steps smoking a meditative pipe 
 is mrs dean within i demanded of the dame 
 mistress dean nay she answered shoo bide here up at th heights 
 are you the housekeeper then i continued 
 ea aw keep th house she replied 
 well mr lockwood the master are there any rooms to lodge me in i wonder i wish to stay here all night 
 t maister she cried in astonishment whet whoiver knew yah wur coming yah sud ha send word nowt norther dry nor mensful abaht t place nowt there 
 she threw down her pipe and bustled in the girl followed and i entered too soon perceiving that her report was true and moreover that i had almost upset her wits by my unwelcome apparition i bid her be composed i would go out for a walk and meantime she must try to prepare a corner of a for me to sup in and a bedroom to sleep in no sweeping and dusting only good fire and dry sheets were necessary she seemed willing to do her best though she thrust the into the grates in mistake for the poker and malappropriated several other articles of her craft but i retired confiding in her energy for a against my return wuthering heights was the goal of my proposed excursion an afterthought brought me back when i had quitted the court 
 all well at the heights i inquired of the woman 
 eea owt ee knaw she answered skurrying away with a pan of hot cinders 
 i would have asked why mrs dean had deserted the grange but it was impossible to delay her at such a crisis so i turned away and made my exit rambling leisurely along with the glow of a sinking sun behind and the mild glory of a rising moon in fading and the other i quitted the park and climbed the stony branching off to mr dwelling before i arrived in sight of it all that remained of day was a beamless amber light along the west but i could see every pebble on the path and every blade of grass by that splendid moon i had neither to climb the gate nor to yielded to my hand that is an improvement i thought and i noticed another by the aid of my nostrils a fragrance of stocks and wallflowers wafted on the air from amongst the homely fruit trees 
 both doors and lattices were open and yet as is usually the case in a coal district a fine red fire illumined the chimney the comfort which the eye derives from it renders the extra heat endurable but the house of wuthering heights is so large that the inmates have plenty of space for withdrawing out of its influence and accordingly what inmates there were had stationed themselves not far from one of the windows i could both see them and hear them talk before i entered and looked and listened in consequence being moved thereto by a mingled sense of curiosity and envy that grew as i lingered 
 said a voice as sweet as a silver for the third time you dunce not going to tell you again recollect or pull your hair 
 contrary then answered another in deep but softened tones and now kiss me for minding so well 
 no read it over first correctly without a single mistake 
 the male speaker began to read he was a young man respectably dressed and seated at a table having a book before him his handsome features glowed with pleasure and his eyes kept impatiently wandering from the page to a small white hand over his shoulder which recalled him by a smart slap on the cheek whenever its owner detected such signs of inattention its owner stood behind her light shining ringlets blending at intervals with his brown locks as she bent to superintend his studies and her was lucky he could not see her face or he would never have been so steady i could and i bit my lip in spite at having thrown away the chance i might have had of doing something besides staring at its smiling beauty 
 the task was done not free from further blunders but the pupil claimed a reward and received at least five kisses which however he generously returned then they came to the door and from their conversation i judged they were about to issue out and have a walk on the moors i supposed i should be condemned in hareton heart if not by his mouth to the lowest pit in the infernal regions if i showed my unfortunate person in his neighbourhood then and feeling very mean and malignant i skulked round to seek refuge in the kitchen there was unobstructed admittance on that side also and at the door sat my old friend nelly dean sewing and singing a song which was often interrupted from within by harsh words of scorn and intolerance uttered in far from musical accents 
 rayther by th haulf hev em swearing i my lugs frough morn to neeght nur hearken yah hahsiver said the tenant of the kitchen in answer to an unheard speech of a blazing shaime ut aw cannut oppen t blessed book bud yah set up them glories tuh sattan un all t flaysome wickednesses ut iver wer born intuh t warld oh a raight nowt un another un that poor be lost atween ye poor lad he added with a groan witched sartin o lord judge em fur norther law nur justice amang wer rullers 
 no or we should be sitting in flaming fagots i suppose retorted the singer but wisht old man and read your bible like a christian and never mind me this is fairy bonny goes to a dance 
 mrs dean was about to recommence when i advanced and recognizing me directly she jumped to her feet crying 
 why bless you mr lockwood how could you think of returning in this way shut up at thrushcross grange you should have given us notice 
 arranged to be accommodated there for as long as i shall stay i answered i depart again tomorrow and how are you transplanted here mrs dean tell me that 
 zillah left and mr heathcliff wished me to come soon after you went to london and stay till you returned but step in pray have you walked from gimmerton this evening 
 from the grange i replied and while they make me lodging room there i want to finish my business with your master because i think of having another opportunity in a hurry 
 what business sir said nelly conducting me into the house gone out at present and return soon 
 about the rent i answered 
 oh then it is with mrs heathcliff you must settle she observed or rather with me she has not learnt to manage her affairs yet and i act for her nobody else 
 i looked surprised 
 ah you have not heard of death i see she continued 
 heathcliff dead i exclaimed astonished how long ago 
 three months since but sit down and let me take your hat and tell you all about it stop you have had nothing to eat have you 
 i want nothing i have ordered supper at home you sit down too i never dreamt of his dying let me hear how it came to pass you say you expect them back for some young people 
 have to scold them every evening for their late rambles but they care for me at least have a drink of our old ale it will do you good you seem weary 
 she hastened to fetch it before i could refuse and i heard joseph asking whether it a crying scandal that she should have fellies at her time of life and then to get them jocks out uh t cellar he fair shaamed to bide still and see it 
 she did not stay to retaliate but in a minute bearing a reaming silver pint whose contents i lauded with becoming earnestness and afterwards she furnished me with the sequel of heathcliffs history he had a queer end as she expressed it 
 i was summoned to wuthering heights within a fortnight of your leaving us she said and i obeyed joyfully for sake my first interview with her grieved and shocked me she had altered so much since our separation mr heathcliff did not explain his reasons for taking a new mind about my coming here he only told me he wanted me and he was tired of seeing catherine i must make the little parlour my and keep her with me it was enough if he were obliged to see her once or twice a day she seemed pleased at this arrangement and by degrees i smuggled over a great number of books and other articles that had formed her amusement at the grange and flattered myself we should get on in tolerable comfort the delusion did not last long catherine contented at first in a brief space grew irritable and restless for one thing she was forbidden to move out of the garden and it fretted her sadly to be confined to its narrow bounds as spring drew on for another in following the house i was forced to quit her frequently and she complained of loneliness she preferred quarrelling with joseph in the kitchen to sitting at peace in her solitude i did not mind their skirmishes but hareton was often obliged to seek the kitchen also when the master wanted to have the house to himself and though in the beginning she either left it at his approach or quietly joined in my occupations and shunned remarking or addressing though he was always as sullen and silent as a while she changed her behaviour and became incapable of letting him alone talking at him commenting on his stupidity and idleness expressing her wonder how he could endure the life he he could sit a whole evening staring into the fire and dozing 
 just like a dog is he not ellen she once observed or a carthorse he does his work eats his food and sleeps eternally what a blank dreary mind he must have do you ever dream hareton and if you do what is it about but you speak to me 
 then she looked at him but he would neither open his mouth nor look again 
 perhaps dreaming now she continued he twitched his shoulder as juno twitches hers ask him ellen 
 mr hareton will ask the master to send you upstairs if you behave i said he had not only twitched his shoulder but clenched his fist as if tempted to use it 
 i know why hareton never speaks when i am in the kitchen she exclaimed on another occasion he is afraid i shall laugh at him ellen what do you think he began to teach himself to read once and because i laughed he burned his books and dropped it was he not a fool 
 were not you naughty i said answer me that 
 perhaps i was she went on but i did not expect him to be so silly hareton if i gave you a book would you take it now try 
 she placed one she had been perusing on his hand he flung it off and muttered if she did not give over he would break her neck 
 well i shall put it here she said in the table drawer and going to bed 
 then she whispered me to watch whether he touched it and departed but he would not come near it and so i informed her in the morning to her great disappointment i saw she was sorry for his persevering sulkiness and indolence her conscience reproved her for frightening him off improving himself she had done it effectually but her ingenuity was at work to remedy the injury while i ironed or pursued other stationary employments i could not well do in the parlour she would bring some pleasant volume and read it aloud to me when hareton was there she generally paused in an interesting part and left the book lying about that she did repeatedly but he was as obstinate as a mule and instead of snatching at her bait in wet weather he took to smoking with joseph and they sat like automatons one on each side of the fire the elder happily too deaf to understand her wicked nonsense as he would have called it the younger doing his best to seem to disregard it on fine evenings the latter followed his shooting expeditions and catherine yawned and sighed and teased me to talk to her and ran off into the court or garden the moment i began and as a last resource cried and said she was tired of living her life was useless 
 mr heathcliff who grew more and more disinclined to society had almost banished earnshaw out of his apartment owing to an accident at the commencement of march he became for some days a fixture in the kitchen his gun burst while out on the hills by himself a splinter cut his arm and he lost a good deal of blood before he could reach home the consequence was that perforce he was condemned to the fireside and tranquillity till he made it up again it suited catherine to have him there at any rate it made her hate her room upstairs more than ever and she would compel me to find out business below that she might accompany me 
 on easter monday joseph went to gimmerton fair with some cattle and in the afternoon i was busy getting up linen in the kitchen earnshaw sat morose as usual at the and my little mistress was beguiling an idle hour with drawing pictures on the window panes varying her amusement by smothered bursts of songs and whispered ejaculations and quick glances of annoyance and impatience in the direction of her cousin who steadfastly smoked and looked into the grate at a notice that i could do with her no longer intercepting my light she removed to the hearthstone i bestowed little attention on her proceedings but presently i heard her begin 
 found out hareton that i i should like you to be my cousin now if you had not grown so cross to me and so rough 
 hareton returned no answer 
 hareton hareton hareton do you hear she continued get off wi ye he growled with uncompromising gruffness 
 let me take that pipe she said cautiously advancing her hand and abstracting it from his mouth 
 before he could attempt to recover it it was broken and behind the fire he swore at her and seized another 
 stop she cried you must listen to me first and i speak while those clouds are floating in my face 
 will you go to the devil he exclaimed ferociously and let me be 
 no she persisted i i tell what to do to make you talk to me and you are determined not to understand when i call you stupid i mean anything i mean that i despise you come you shall take notice of me hareton you are my cousin and you shall own me 
 i shall have naught to do wi you and your mucky pride and your damned mocking tricks he answered go to hell body and soul before i look sideways after you again side out o t gait now this minute 
 catherine frowned and retreated to the chewing her lip and endeavouring by humming an eccentric tune to conceal a growing tendency to sob 
 you should be friends with your cousin mr hareton i interrupted since she repents of her sauciness it would do you a great deal of good it would make you another man to have her for a companion 
 a companion he cried when she hates me and does not think me fit to wipe her shoon nay if it made me a king not be scorned for seeking her goodwill any more 
 it is not i who hate you it is you who hate me wept cathy no longer disguising her trouble you hate me as much as mr heathcliff does and more 
 a damned liar began earnshaw why have i made him angry by taking your part then a hundred times and that when you sneered at and despised me on plaguing me and step in yonder and say you worried me out of the kitchen 
 i know you took my part she answered drying her eyes and i was miserable and bitter at everybody but now i thank you and beg you to forgive me what can i do besides 
 she returned to the hearth and frankly extended her hand he blackened and scowled like a thunder cloud and kept his fists resolutely clenched and his gaze fixed on the ground catherine by instinct must have divined it was obdurate perversity and not dislike that prompted this dogged conduct for after remaining an instant undecided she stooped and impressed on his cheek a gentle kiss the little rogue thought i had not seen her and drawing back she took her former station by the window quite demurely i shook my head reprovingly and then she blushed and whispered 
 well what should i have done ellen he shake hands and he look i must show him some way that i like i want to be friends 
 whether the kiss convinced hareton i cannot tell he was very careful for some minutes that his face should not be seen and when he did raise it he was sadly puzzled where to turn his eyes 
 catherine employed herself in wrapping a handsome book neatly in white paper and having tied it with a bit of ribband and addressed it to mr hareton earnshaw she desired me to be her ambassadress and convey the present to its destined recipient 
 and tell him if take it come and teach him to read it right she said and if he refuse it go upstairs and never tease him again 
 i carried it and repeated the message anxiously watched by my employer hareton would not open his fingers so i laid it on his knee he did not strike off either i returned to my work catherine leaned her head and arms on the table till she heard the slightest rustle of the covering being removed then she stole away and quietly seated herself beside her cousin he trembled and his face glowed all his rudeness and all his surly harshness had deserted him he could not summon courage at first to utter a syllable in reply to her questioning look and her murmured petition 
 say you forgive me hareton do you can make me so happy by speaking that little word 
 he muttered something inaudible 
 and be my friend added catherine interrogatively 
 nay be ashamed of me every day of your life he answered and the more the more you know me and i cannot bide it 
 so you be my friend she said smiling as sweet as honey and creeping close up 
 i overheard no further distinguishable talk but on looking round again i perceived two such radiant countenances bent over the page of the accepted book that i did not doubt the treaty had been ratified on both sides and the enemies were thenceforth sworn allies 
 the work they studied was full of costly pictures and those and their position had charm enough to keep them unmoved till joseph came home he poor man was perfectly aghast at the spectacle of catherine seated on the same bench with hareton earnshaw leaning her hand on his shoulder and confounded at his endurance of her proximity it affected him too deeply to allow an observation on the subject that night his emotion was only revealed by the immense sighs he drew as he solemnly spread his large bible on the table and overlaid it with dirty from his the produce of the transactions at length he summoned hareton from his seat 
 tak these in tuh t maister lad he said un bide thar gang up tuh my awn rahm this norther mensful nor seemly fur us we mun side aht and seearch another 
 come catherine i said we must side out too done my ironing are you ready to go 
 it is not eight she answered rising unwillingly hareton leave this book upon the and bring some more tomorrow 
 ony books ut yah leave aw suall tak intuh th hahse said joseph un be mitch if yah find em agean soa yah muh plase yourseln 
 cathy threatened that his library should pay for hers and smiling as she passed hareton went singing upstairs lighter of heart i venture to say than ever she had been under that roof before except perhaps during her earliest visits to linton 
 the intimacy thus commenced grew rapidly though it encountered temporary interruptions earnshaw was not to be civilized with a wish and my young lady was no philosopher and no paragon of patience but both their minds tending to the same loving and desiring to esteem and the other loving and desiring to be contrived in the end to reach it 
 you see mr lockwood it was easy enough to win mrs heart but now glad you did not try the crown of all my wishes will be the union of those two i shall envy no one on their wedding day there be a happier woman than myself in england

 chapter 
 
 
 jo anxious about beth 
 why mother she has seemed unusually well since the babies came 
 not her health that troubles me now her spirits sure there is something on her mind and i want you to discover what it is 
 what makes you think so mother 
 she sits alone a good deal and talk to her father as much as she used i found her crying over the babies the other day when she sings the songs are always sad ones and now and then i see a look in her face that i understand this like beth and it worries me 
 have you asked her about it 
 i have tried once or twice but she either evaded my questions or looked so distressed that i stopped i never force my confidence and i seldom have to wait for long 
 mrs march glanced at jo as she spoke but the face opposite seemed quite unconscious of any secret disquietude but and after sewing thoughtfully for a minute jo said i think she is growing up and so begins to dream dreams and have hopes and fears and fidgets without knowing why or being able to explain them why mother eighteen but we realize it and treat her like a child forgetting a woman 
 so she is dear heart how fast you do grow up returned her mother with a sigh and a smile 
 be helped marmee so you must resign yourself to all sorts of worries and let your birds hop out of the nest one by one i promise never to hop very far if that is any comfort to you 
 a great comfort jo i always feel strong when you are at home now meg is gone beth is too feeble and amy too young to depend upon but when the tug comes you are always ready 
 why you know i mind hard jobs much and there must always be one scrub in a family amy is splendid in fine works and not but i feel in my element when all the carpets are to be taken up or half the family fall sick at once amy is distinguishing herself abroad but if anything is amiss at home your man 
 i leave beth to your hands then for she will open her tender little heart to her jo sooner than to anyone else be very kind and let her think anyone watches or talks about her if she only would get quite strong and cheerful again i have a wish in the world 
 happy woman got heaps 
 my dear what are they 
 settle troubles and then tell you mine they are not very wearing so keep and jo stitched away with a wise nod which set her heart at rest about her for the present at least 
 while apparently absorbed in her own affairs jo watched beth and after many conflicting conjectures finally settled upon one which seemed to explain the change in her a slight incident gave jo the clue to the mystery she thought and lively fancy loving heart did the rest she was affecting to write busily one saturday afternoon when she and beth were alone together yet as she scribbled she kept her eye on her sister who seemed unusually quiet sitting at the window work often dropped into her lap and she leaned her head upon her hand in a dejected attitude while her eyes rested on the dull autumnal landscape suddenly some one passed below whistling like an operatic blackbird and a voice called out all serene coming in tonight 
 beth started leaned forward smiled and nodded watched the till his quick tramp died away then said softly as if to herself how strong and well and happy that dear boy looks 
 hum said jo still intent upon her face for the bright color faded as quickly as it came the smile vanished and presently a tear lay shining on the window ledge beth whisked it off and in her face read a tender sorrow that made her own eyes fill fearing to betray herself she slipped away murmuring something about needing more paper 
 mercy on me beth loves laurie she said sitting down in her own room pale with the shock of the discovery which she believed she had just made i never dreamed of such a thing what will mother say i wonder if her there jo stopped and turned scarlet with a sudden thought if he love back again how dreadful it would be he must make him and she shook her head threateningly at the picture of the mischievous looking boy laughing at her from the wall oh dear we are growing up with a vengeance meg married and a mamma amy flourishing away at paris and beth in love the only one that has sense enough to keep out of mischief jo thought intently for a minute with her eyes fixed on the picture then she smoothed out her wrinkled forehead and said with a decided nod at the face opposite no thank you sir very charming but no more stability than a weathercock so you write touching notes and smile in that insinuating way for it do a bit of good and i have it 
 then she sighed and fell into a reverie from which she did not wake till the early twilight sent her down to take new observations which only confirmed her suspicion though laurie flirted with amy and joked with jo his manner to beth had always been peculiarly kind and gentle but so was therefore no one thought of imagining that he cared more for her than for the others indeed a general impression had prevailed in the family of late that our boy was getting fonder than ever of jo who however hear a word upon the subject and scolded violently if anyone dared to suggest it if they had known the various tender passages which had been nipped in the bud they would have had the immense satisfaction of saying i told you so but jo hated philandering and allow it always having a joke or a smile ready at the least sign of impending danger when laurie first went to college he fell in love about once a month but these small flames were as brief as ardent did no damage and much amused jo who took great interest in the alternations of hop despair and resignation which were confided to her in their weekly conferences but there came a time when laurie ceased to worship at many shrines hinted darkly at one passion and indulged occasionally in byronic fits of gloom then he avoided the tender subject altogether wrote philosophical notes to jo turned studious and gave out that he was going to dig intending to graduate in a blaze of glory this suited the young lady better than twilight confidences tender pressures of the hand and eloquent glances of the eye for with jo brain developed earlier than heart and she preferred imaginary heroes to real ones because when tired of them the former could be shut up in the tin kitchen till called for and the latter were less manageable 
 things were in this state when the grand discovery was made and jo watched laurie that night as she had never done before if she had not got the new idea into her head she would have seen nothing unusual in the fact that beth was very quiet and laurie very kind to her but having given the rein to her lively fancy it galloped away with her at a great pace and common sense being rather weakened by a long course or romance writing did not come to the rescue as usual beth lay on the sofa and laurie sat in a low chair close by amusing her with all sorts of gossip for she depended on her weekly spin and he never disappointed her but that evening jo fancied that eyes rested on the lively dark face beside her with peculiar pleasure and that she listened with intense interest to an account of some exciting cricket match though the phrases caught off a tice stumped off his ground and the leg hit for three were as intelligible to her as sanskrit she also fancied having set her heart upon seeing it that she saw a certain increase of gentleness in manner that he dropped his voice now and then laughed less than usual was a little and settled the afghan over feet with an assiduity that was really almost tender 
 who knows stranger things have happened thought jo as she fussed about the room she will make quite an angel of him and he will make life delightfully easy and pleasant for the dear if they only love each other i see how he can help it and i do believe he would if the rest of us were out of the way 
 as everyone was out of the way but herself jo began to feel that she ought to dispose of herself with all speed but where should she go and burning to lay herself upon the shrine of sisterly devotion she sat down to settle that point 
 now the old sofa was a regular patriarch of a broad and low a trifle shabby as well it might be for the girls had slept and sprawled on it as babies fished over the back rode on the arms and had menageries under it as children and rested tired heads dreamed dreams and listened to tender talk on it as young women they all loved it for it was a family refuge and one corner had always been favorite lounging place among the many pillows that adorned the venerable couch was one hard round covered with prickly horsehair and furnished with a knobby button at each end this repulsive pillow was her especial property being used as a weapon of defense a barricade or a stern preventive of too much slumber 
 laurie knew this pillow well and had cause to regard it with deep aversion having been unmercifully pummeled with it in former days when romping was allowed and now frequently debarred by it from the seat he most coveted next ot jo in the sofa corner if the sausage as the called it stood on end it was a sign that he might approach and repose but if it lay flat across the sofa woe to man woman or child who dared disturb it that evening jo forgot to barricade her corner and had not been in her seat five minutes before a massive form appeared beside her and with both arms spread over the sofa back both long legs stretched out before him laurie exclaimed with a sigh of satisfaction 
 now this is filling at the price 
 no slang snapped jo slamming down the pillow but it was too late there was no room for it and coasting onto the floor it disappeared in a most mysterious manner 
 come jo be thorny after studying himself to a skeleton all the week a fellow deserves petting and ought to get it 
 beth will pet you busy 
 no not to be bothered with me but you like that sort 
 of thing unless suddenly lost your taste for it have you 
 do you hate your boy and want to fire pillows at him 
 anything more wheedlesome than that touching appeal was seldom heard but jo quenched her boy by turning on him with a stern query how many bouquets have you sent miss randal this week 
 not one upon my word engaged now then 
 glad of it one of your foolish extravagances sending flowers and things to girls for whom you care two pins continued jo reprovingly 
 sensible girls for whom i do care whole papers of pins let me send them flowers and things so what can i do my feelings need a vent 
 mother approve of flirting even in fun and you do flirt desperately teddy 
 give anything if i could answer so do you as i merely say that i see any harm in that pleasant little game if all parties understand that only play 
 well it does look pleasant but i learn how done tried because one feels awkward in company not to do as everybody else id doing but i seem to get on said jo forgetting to play mentor 
 take lessons of amy she has a regular talent for it 
 yes she does it very prettily and never seems to go too far i suppose natural to some people to please without trying and others to always say and do the wrong thing in the wrong place 
 glad you flirt really refreshing to see a sensible straightforward girl who can be jolly and kind without making a fool of herself between ourselves jo some of the girls i know really do go on at such a rate ashamed of them they mean any harm sure but if they knew how we fellows talked about them afterward mend their ways i fancy 
 they do the same and as their tongues are the sharpest you fellows get the worst of it for you are as silly as they every bit if you behaved properly they would but knowing you like their nonsense they keep it up and then you blame them 
 much you know about it said laurie in a superior tone we like romps and flirts though we may act as if we did sometimes the pretty modest girls are never talked about except respectfully among gentleman bless your innocent soul if you could be in my place for a month see things that would astonish you a trifle upon my word when i see one of those girls i always want to say with our friend cock robin 
 out upon you fie upon you jig 
 it was impossible to help laughing at the funny conflict between chivalrous reluctance to speak ill of womankind and his very natural dislike of the unfeminine folly of which fashionable society showed him many samples jo knew that young laurence was regarded as a most eligible parti by worldly mamas was much smiled upon by their daughters and flattered enough by ladies of all ages to make a coxcomb of him so she watched him rather jealously fearing he would be spoiled and rejoiced more than she confessed to find that he still believed in modest girls returning suddenly to her admonitory tone she said dropping her voice if you must have a went teddy go and devote yourself to one of the pretty modest girls whom you do respect and not waste your time with the silly ones 
 you really advise it and laurie looked at her with an odd mixture of anxiety and merriment in his face 
 yes i do but better wait till you are through college on the whole and be fitting yourself for the place meantime not half good enough whoever the modest girl may be and jo looked a little queer likewise for a name had almost escaped her 
 that not acquiesced laurie with an expression of humility quite new to him as he dropped his eyes and absently wound apron tassel round his finger 
 mercy on us this will never do thought jo adding aloud go and sing to me dying for some music and always like yours 
 rather stay here thank you 
 well you there room go and make yourself useful since you are too big to be ornamental i thought you hated to be tied to a apron string retorted jo quoting certain rebellious words of his own 
 ah that depends on who wears the apron and laurie gave an audacious tweak at the tassel 
 are you going demanded jo diving for the pillow 
 he fled at once and the minute it was well up with the bonnets of bonnie dundee she slipped away to return no more till the young gentleman departed in high dudgeon 
 jo lay long awake that night and was just dropping off when the sound of a stifled sob made her fly to bedside with the anxious inquiry what is it dear 
 i thought you were asleep sobbed beth 
 is it the old pain my precious 
 no a new one but i can bear it and beth tried to check her tears 
 tell me all about it and let me cure it as i often did the other 
 you there is no cure there voice gave way and clinging to her sister she cried so despairingly that jo was frightened 
 where is it shall i call mother 
 no no call her tell her i shall be better soon lie down here and poor my head be quiet and go to sleep indeed i will jo obeyed but as her hand went softly to and fro across hot forehead and wet eyelids her heart was very full and she longed to speak but young as she was jo had learned that hearts like flowers cannot be rudely handled but must open naturally so though she believed she knew the cause of new pain she only said in her tenderest tone does anything trouble you deary 
 yes jo after a long pause 
 it comfort you to tell me what it is 
 not now not yet 
 then i ask but remember bethy that mother and jo are always glad to hear and help you if they can 
 i know it tell you 
 is the pain better now 
 oh yes much better you are so comfortable jo 
 go to sleep dear stay with you 
 so cheek to cheek they fell asleep and on the morrow beth seemed quite herself again for at eighteen neither heads nor hearts ache long and a loving word can medicine most ills 
 but jo had made up her mind and after pondering over a project for some days she confided it to her mother 
 you asked me the other day what my wishes were tell you one of them marmee she began as they sat along together i want to go away somewhere this winter for a change 
 why jo and her mother looked up quickly as if the words suggested a double meaning 
 with her eyes on her work jo answered soberly i want something new i feel restless and anxious to be seeing doing and learning more than i am i brood too much over my own small affairs and need stirring up so as i can be spared this winter like to hop a little way and try my wings 
 where will you hop 
 to new york i had a bright idea yesterday and this is it you know mrs kirke wrote to you for some respectable young person to teach her children and sew rather hard to find just the thing but i think i should suit if i tried 
 my dear go out to service in that great boarding house and mrs march looked surprised but not displeased 
 not exactly going out to service for mrs kirke is your kindest soul that ever would make things pleasant for me i know her family is separate from the rest and no one knows me there care if they do honest work and not ashamed of it 
 nor i but your writing 
 all the better for the change i shall see and hear new things get new ideas and even if i much time there i shall bring home quantities of material for my rubbish 
 i have no doubt of it but are these your only reasons for this sudden fancy 
 no mother 
 may i know the others 
 jo looked up and jo looked down then said slowly with sudden color in her cheeks it may be vain and wrong to say it is getting too fond of me 
 then you care for him in the way it is evident he begins to care for you and mrs march looked anxious as she put the question 
 mercy no i love the dear boy as i always have and am immensely proud of him but as for anything more out of the question 
 glad of that jo 
 why please 
 because dear i think you suited to one another as friends you are very happy and your frequent quarrels soon blow over but i fear you would both rebel if you were mated for life you are too much alike and too fond of freedom not to mention hot tempers and strong wills to get on happily together in a relation which needs infinite patience and forbearance as well as love 
 just the feeling i had though i express it glad you think he is only beginning to care for me it would trouble me sadly to make him unhappy for i fall in love with the dear old fellow merely out of gratitude could i 
 you are sure of his feeling for you 
 the color deepened in cheeks as she answered with the look of mingled pleasure pride and pain which young girls wear when speaking of first lovers afraid it is so mother he said anything but he looks a great deal i think i had better go away before it comes to anything 
 i agree with you and if it can be managed you shall go 
 jo looked relieved and after a pause said smiling how mrs moffat would wonder at your want of management if she knew and how she will rejoice that annie may still hope 
 ah jo mothers may differ in their management but the hope is the same in desire to see their children happy meg is so and i am content with her success you i leave to enjoy your liberty till you tire of it for only then will you find that there is something sweeter amy is my chief care now but her good sense will help her for beth i indulge no hopes except that she may be well by the way she seems brighter this last day or two have you spoken to her 
 yes she owned she had a trouble and promised to tell me i said no more for i think i know it and jo told her little story 
 mrs march shook her head and did not take so romantic a view of the case but looked grave and repeated her opinion that for sake jo should go away for a time 
 let us say nothing about it to him till the plan is settled then run away before he can collect his wits and be tragic beth must think going to please myself as i am for i talk about laurie to her but she can pet and comfort him after gone and so cure him of this romantic notion been through so many little trials of the sort used to it and will soon get over his lovelornity 
 jo spoke hopefully but could not rid herself of the foreboding fear that this little trial would be harder than the others and that laurie would not get over his lovelornity as easily as heretofore 
 the plan was talked over in a family council and agreed upon for mrs kirke gladly accepted jo and promised to make a pleasant home for her the teaching would render her independent and such leisure as she got might be made profitable by writing while the new scenes and society would be both useful and agreeable jo liked the prospect and was eager to be gone for the home nest was growing too narrow for her restless nature and adventurous spirit when all was settled with fear and trembling she told laurie but to her surprise he took it very quietly he had been graver than usual of late but very pleasant and when jokingly accused of turning over a new leaf he answered soberly so i am and i mean this one shall stay turned 
 jo was very much relieved that one of his virtuous fits should come on just then and made her preparations with a lightened heart for beth seemed more cheerful and hoped she was doing the best for all 
 one thing i leave in your especial care she said the night before she left 
 you mean your papers asked beth no my boy be very good to him you 
 of course i will but i fill your place and miss you sadly 
 it hurt him so remember i leave him in your charge to plague pet and keep in order 
 do my best for your sake promised beth wondering why jo looked at her so queerly 
 when laurie said he whispered significantly it do a bit of good jo my eye is on you so mind what you do or come and bring you home

lionfish nov chapter flesh blood and bonecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry felt his feet slam into the ground his injured leg gave way and he fell forward his hand let go of the triwizard cup at last he raised his head 
 
 where are we he said 
 
 cedric shook his head he got up pulled harry to his feet and they looked around 
 
 they had left the hogwarts grounds completely they had obviously traveled miles perhaps hundreds of miles for even the mountains surrounding the castle were gone they were standing instead in a dark and overgrown graveyard the black outline of a small church was visible beyond a large yew tree to their right a hill rose above them to their left harry could just make out the outline of a fine old house on the hillside 
 
 cedric looked down at the triwizard cup and then up at harry 
 
 did anyone tell you the cup was a portkey he asked 
 
 nope said harry he was looking around the graveyard it was completely silent and slightly eerie is this supposed to be part of the task 
 
 i dunno said cedric he sounded slightly nervous wands out reckon 
 
 yeah said harry glad that cedric had made the suggestion rather than him 
 
 they pulled out their wands harry kept looking around him he had yet again the strange feeling that they were being watched 
 
 coming he said suddenly 
 
 squinting tensely through the darkness they watched the figure drawing nearer walking steadily toward them between the graves harry make out a face but from the way it was walking and holding its arms he could tell that it was carrying something whoever it was he was short and wearing a hooded cloak pulled up over his head to obscure his face and several paces nearer the gap between them closing all the time harry saw that the thing in the persons arms looked like a babyor was it merely a bundle of robes 
 
 harry lowered his wand slightly and glanced sideways at cedric cedric shot him a quizzical look they both turned back to watch the approaching figure 
 
 it stopped beside a towering marble headstone only six feet from them for a second harry and cedric and the short figure simply looked at one another 
 
 and then without warning scar exploded with pain it was agony such as he had never felt in all his life his wand slipped from his fingers as he put his hands over his face his knees buckled he was on the ground and he could see nothing at all his head was about to split open 
 
 from far away above his head he heard a high cold voice say kill the spare 
 
 a swishing noise and a second voice which screeched the words to the night avada kedavra 
 
 a blast of green light blazed through eyelids and he heard something heavy fall to the ground beside him the pain in his scar reached such a pitch that he retched and then it diminished terrified of what he was about to see he opened his stinging eyes 
 
 cedric was lying on the ground beside him he was dead 
 
 for a second that contained an eternity harry stared into face at his open gray eyes blank and expressionless as the windows of a deserted house at his mouth which looked slightly surprised and then before mind had accepted what he was seeing before he could feel anything but numb disbelief he felt himself being pulled to his feet 
 
 the short man in the cloak had put down his bundle lit his wand and was dragging harry toward the marble headstone harry saw the name upon it flickering in the wandlight before he was forced around and slammed against it 
 
 tom riddle 
 the cloaked man was now conjuring tight cords around harry tying him from neck to ankles to the headstone harry could hear shallow fast breathing from the depths of the hood he struggled and the man hit him hit him with a hand that had a finger missing and harry realized who was under the hood it was wormtail 
 
 you he gasped 
 
 but wormtail who had finished conjuring the ropes did not reply he was busy checking the tightness of the cords his fingers trembling uncontrollably fumbling over the knots once sure that harry was bound so tightly to the headstone that he move an inch wormtail drew a length of some black material from the inside of his cloak and stuffed it roughly into mouth then without a word he turned from harry and hurried away harry make a sound nor could he see where wormtail had gone he turn his head to see beyond the headstone he could see only what was right in front of him 
 
 body was lying some twenty feet away some way beyond him glinting in the starlight lay the triwizard cup wand was on the ground at feet the bundle of robes that harry had thought was a baby was close by at the foot of the grave it seemed to be stirring fretfully harry watched it and his scar seared with pain againand he suddenly knew that he want to see what was in those robeshe want that bundle opened 
 
 he could hear noises at his feet he looked down and saw a gigantic snake slithering through the grass circling the headstone where he was tied fast wheezy breathing was growing louder again it sounded as though he was forcing something heavy across the ground then he came back within range of vision and harry saw him pushing a stone cauldron to the foot of the grave it was full of what seemed to be water harry could hear it slopping around and it was larger than any cauldron harry had ever used a great stone belly large enough for a man to sit in 
 
 the thing inside the bundle of robes on the ground was stirring more persistently as though it was trying to free itself now wormtail was busying himself at the bottom of the cauldron with a wand suddenly there were crackling names beneath it the large snake slithered away into the darkness 
 
 the liquid in the cauldron seemed to heat very fast the surface began not only to bubble but to send out fiery sparks as though it were on fire steam was thickening blurring the outline of wormtail tending the fire the movements beneath the robes became more agitated and harry heard the high cold voice again 
 
 hurry 
 
 the whole surface of the water was alight with sparks now it might have been encrusted with diamonds 
 
 it is ready master 
 
 now said the cold voice 
 
 wormtail pulled open the robes on the ground revealing what was inside them and harry let out a yell that was strangled in the wad of material blocking his mouth 
 
 it was as though wormtail had flipped over a stone and revealed something ugly slimy and blind but worse a hundred times worse the thing wormtail had been carrying had the shape of a crouched human child except that harry had never seen anything less like a child it was hairless and a dark raw reddish black its arms and legs were thin and feeble and its face no child alive ever had a face like that flat and snakelike with gleaming red eyes 
 
 the thing seemed almost helpless it raised its thin arms put them around neck and wormtail lifted it as he did so his hood fell back and harry saw the look of revulsion on weak pale face in the firelight as he carried the creature to the rim of the cauldron for one moment harry saw the evil flat face illuminated in the sparks dancing on the surface of the potion and then wormtail lowered the creature into the cauldron there was a hiss and it vanished below the surface harry heard its frail body hit the bottom with a soft thud 
 
 let it drown harry thought his scar burning almost past endurance pleaselet it drown 
 
 wormtail was speaking his voice shook he seemed frightened beyond his wits he raised his wand closed his eyes and spoke to the night 
 
 bone of the father unknowingly given you will renew your son 
 
 the surface of the grave at feet cracked horrified harry watched as a fine trickle of dust rose into the air at command and fell softly into the cauldron the diamond surface of the water broke and hissed it sent sparks in all directions and turned a vivid blue 
 
 and now wormtail was whimpering he pulled a long thin shining silver dagger from inside his cloak his voice broke into petrified sobs 
 
 flesh of the servant given you will revive your master 
 
 he stretched his right hand out in front of him the hand with the missing finger he gripped the dagger very tightly in his left hand and swung it upward 
 
 harry realized what wormtail was about to do a second before it happened he closed his eyes as tightly as he could but he could not block the scream that pierced the night that went through harry as though he had been stabbed with the dagger too he heard something fall to the ground heard anguished panting then a sickening splash as something was dropped into the cauldron harry stand to lookbut the potion had turned a burning red the light of it shone through closed eyelids 
 
 wormtail was gasping and moaning with agony not until harry felt anguished breath on his face did he realize that wormtail was right in front of him 
 
 of the enemyforcibly takenyou willresurrect your foe 
 
 harry could do nothing to prevent it he was tied too down struggling hopelessly at the ropes binding him he saw the shining silver dagger shaking in remaining hand he felt its point penetrate the crook of his right arm and blood seeping down the sleeve of his torn robes wormtail still panting with pain rumbled in his pocket for a glass vial and held it to cut so that a dribble of blood fell into it 
 
 he staggered back to the cauldron with blood he poured it inside the liquid within turned instantly a blinding white wormtail his job done dropped to his knees beside the cauldron then slumped sideways and lay on the ground cradling the bleeding stump of his arm gasping and sobbing 
 
 the cauldron was simmering sending its diamond sparks in all directions so blindingly bright that it turned all else to velvety blackness nothing happened 
 
 let it have drowned harry thought let it have gone wrong 
 
 and then suddenly the sparks emanating from the cauldron were extinguished a surge of white steam billowed thickly from the cauldron instead obliterating everything in front of harry so that he see wormtail or cedric or anything but vapor hanging in the gone wrong he drowned pleaseplease let it be dead 
 
 but then through the mist in front of him he saw with an icy surge of terror the dark outline of a man tall and skeletally thin rising slowly from inside the cauldron 
 
 robe me said the high cold voice from behind the steam and wormtail sobbing and moaning still cradling his mutilated arm scrambled to pick up the black robes from the ground got to his feet reached up and pulled them over his head 
 
 the thin man stepped out of the cauldron staring at harryand harry stared back into the face that had haunted his nightmares for three years whiter than a skull with wide livid scarlet eyes and a nose that was flat as a snakes with slits for nostrils 
 
 lord voldemort had risen again 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the goblet of fire 
 

lionfish nov chapter out of the firecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 not going i need the hospital wing i want 
 
 he was gibbering as he tried to pull away from professor tofty who was looking at harry with much concern after helping him out into the entrance hall with the students all around them staring 
 
 fine sir harry stammered wiping the sweat from his face really i just fell asleep had a nightmare 
 
 pressure of examinations said the old wizard sympathetically patting harry shakily on the shoulder it happens young man it happens now a cooling drink of water and perhaps you will be ready to return to the great hall the examination is nearly over but you may be able to round off your last answer nicely 
 
 yes said harry wildly i mean no donedone as much as i can i think 
 
 very well very well said the old wizard gently i shall go and collect your examination paper and i suggest that you go and have a nice lie down 
 
 do that said harry nodding vigorously thanks very much 
 
 the second that the old heels disappeared over the threshold into the great hall harry ran up the marble staircase hurtled along the corridors so fast the portraits he passed muttered reproaches up more flights of stairs and finally burst like a hurricane through the double doors of the hospital wing causing madam pomfreywho had been spooning some bright blue liquid into open mouthto shriek in alarm 
 
 potter what do you think doing 
 
 i need to see professor mcgonagall gasped harry the breath tearing his lungs now urgent 
 
 not here potter said madam pomfrey sadly she was transferred to st this morning four stunning spells straight to the chest at her age a wonder they kill her 
 
 gone said harry shocked 
 
 the bell rang just outside the dormitory and he heard the usual distant rumbling of students starting to flood out into the corridors above and below him he remained quite still looking at madam pomfrey terror was rising inside him 
 
 there was nobody left to tell dumbledore had gone hagrid had gone but he had always expected professor mcgonagall to be there irascible and inflexible perhaps but always dependably solidly present 
 
 i wonder shocked potter said madam pomfrey with a kind of fierce approval in her face as if one of them could have stunned minerva mcgonagall by daylight cowardice what it was despicable cowardice if i worried what would happen to you students without me resign in protest 
 
 yes said harry blankly 
 
 he wheeled around and strode blindly from the hospital wing into the teeming corridor where he stood buffeted by the crowd panic expanding inside him like poison gas so that his head swam and he could not think what to do 
 
 ron and hermione said a voice in his head 
 
 he was running again pushing students out of the way oblivious to their angry protests he sprinted back down two floors and was at the top of the marble staircase when he saw them hurrying towards him 
 
 harry said hermione at once looking very frightened what happened are you all right are you ill 
 
 where have you been demanded ron 
 
 come with me harry said quickly come on got to tell you something 
 
 he led them along the corridor peering through doorways and at last found an empty classroom into which he dived closing the door behind ron and hermione the moment they were inside and leaned against it facing them 
 
 voldemorts got sirius 
 
 what 
 
 how 
 
 saw it just now when i fell asleep in the exam 
 
 butbut where how said hermione whose face was white 
 
 i dunno how said harry but i know exactly where a room in the department of mysteries full of shelves covered in these little glass balls and at the end of row trying to use sirius to get whatever it is he wants from in there torturing him says end by killing him 
 
 harry found his voice was shaking as were his knees he moved over to a desk and sat down on it trying to master himself 
 
 we going to get there he asked them 
 
 there was a silence then ron said there 
 
 get to the department of mysteries so we can rescue sirius harry said loudly 
 
 butharry said ron weakly 
 
 what what said harry 
 
 he could not understand why they were both gaping at him as though he was asking them something unreasonable 
 
 harry said hermione in a rather frightened voice er how how did voldemort get into the ministry of magic without anybody realising he was there 
 
 how do i know bellowed harry the question is how going to get in there 
 
 but harry think about this said hermione taking a step towards him five in the afternoon the ministry of magic must be full of workers how would voldemort and sirius have got in without being seen harry probably the two most wanted wizards in the world you think they could get into a building full of aurors undetected 
 
 i dunno voldemort used an invisibility cloak or something harry shouted anyway the department of mysteries has always been completely empty whenever been 
 
 never been there harry said hermione quietly dreamed about the place all 
 
 not normal dreams harry shouted in her face standing up and taking a step closer to her in turn he wanted to shake her how explain dad then what was all that about how come i knew what had happened to him 
 
 got a point said ron quietly looking at hermione 
 
 but this is just just so unlikely said hermione desperately harry how on earth could voldemort have got hold of sirius when been in grimmauld place all the time 
 
 sirius cracked and just wanted some fresh air said ron sounding worried been desperate to get out of that house for ages 
 
 but why hermione persisted why on earth would voldemort want to use sirius to get the weapon or whatever the thing is 
 
 i dunno there could be loads of reasons harry yelled at her maybe sirius is just someone voldemort care about seeing hurt 
 
 you know what just thought of something said ron in a hushed voice brother was a death eater he maybe he told sirius the secret of how to get the weapon 
 
 yeahand why been so keen to keep sirius locked up all the time said harry 
 
 look sorry cried hermione but neither of you is making sense and got no proof for any of this no proof voldemort and sirius are even there 
 
 hermione seen them said ron rounding on her 
 
 ok she said looking frightened yet determined just got to say this 
 
 what 
 
 you this a criticism harry but you do sort of i you think got a bit of thing she said 
 
 he glared at her 
 
 and that supposed to mean a thing 
 
 well you she looked more apprehensive than ever i mean last year for instance in the lake during the tournament you have i mean you need to save that little delacour girl you got a bit carried away 
 
 a wave of hot prickly anger swept through body now could she remind him of that blunder now 
 
 i mean it was really great of you and everything said hermione quickly looking positively petrified at the look on face everyone thought it was a wonderful thing to do 
 
 funny said harry through gritted teeth because i definitely remember ron saying wasted time acting the hero is that what you think this is you reckon i want to act the hero again 
 
 no no no said hermione looking aghast not what i mean at all 
 
 well spit out what got to say because wasting time here harry shouted 
 
 trying to say voldemort knows you harry he took ginny down into the chamber of secrets to lure you there the kind of thing he does he knows thethe sort of person go to aid what if just trying to get you into the department of myst 
 
 hermione it matter if done it to get me there or taken mcgonagall to st there anyone from the order left at hogwarts who we can tell and if we go sirius is dead 
 
 but harrywhat if your dream waswas just that a dream 
 
 harry let out a roar of frustration hermione actually stepped back from him looking alarmed 
 
 you get it harry shouted at her not having nightmares not just dreaming what think all the occlumency was for why think dumbledore wanted me prevented from seeing these things because real hermionesirius is trapped seen him got him and no one else knows and that means the only ones who can save him and if you want to do it fine but going understand and if i remember rightly you have a problem with my thing when it was you i was saving from the dementors orhe rounded on ronwhen it was your sister i was saving from the basilisk 
 
 i never said i had a problem said ron heatedly 
 
 but harry just said it said hermione fiercely dumbledore wanted you to learn to shut these things out of your mind if done occlumency properly never have seen this 
 
 if you think just going to act like i seen 
 
 sirius told you there was nothing more important than you learning to close your mind 
 
 well i expect say something different if he knew what just 
 
 the classroom door opened harry ron and hermione whipped around ginny walked in looking curious closely followed by luna who as usual looked as though she had drifted in accidentally 
 
 hi said ginny uncertainly we recognised voice what are you yelling about 
 
 never you mind said harry roughly 
 
 ginny raised her eyebrows 
 
 no need to take that tone with me she said coolly i was only wondering whether i could help 
 
 well you said harry shortly 
 
 being rather rude you know said luna serenely 
 
 harry swore and turned away the very last thing he wanted now was a conversation with luna lovegood 
 
 wait said hermione suddenly wait harry they can help 
 
 harry and ron looked at her 
 
 listen she said urgently harry we need to establish whether sirius really has left headquarters 
 
 told you i saw 
 
 harry begging you please said hermione desperately please just check that sirius at home before we go charging off to london if we find out not there then i swear i try to stop you come ddo whatever it takes to try and save him 
 
 sirius is being tortured now shouted harry we got time to waste 
 
 but if this is a trick of harry got to check got to 
 
 how harry demanded we going to check 
 
 have to use fire and see if we can contact him said hermione who looked positively terrified at the thought draw umbridge away again but need lookouts and where we can use ginny and luna 
 
 though clearly struggling to understand what was going on ginny said immediately yeah do it and luna said when you say sirius are you talking about stubby boardman 
 
 nobody answered her 
 
 ok harry said aggressively to hermione ok if you can think of a way of doing this quickly with you otherwise going to the department of mysteries right now 
 
 the department of mysteries said luna looking mildly surprised but how are you going to get there 
 
 again harry ignored her 
 
 right said hermione twisting her hands together and pacing up and down between the desks right well one of us has to go and find umbridge andand send her off in the wrong direction keep her away from her office they could tell heri knowthat peeves is up to something awful as usual 
 
 do it said ron at once tell her peeves is smashing up the transfiguration department or something miles away from her office come to think of it i could probably persuade peeves to do it if i met him on the way 
 
 it was a mark of the seriousness of the situation that hermione made no objection to the smashing up of the transfiguration department 
 
 ok she said her brow furrowed as she continued to pace now we need to keep students right away from her office while we force entry or some bound to go and tip her off 
 
 luna and i can stand at either end of the corridor said ginny promptly and warn people not to go down there because let off a load of garrotting gas hermione looked surprised at the readiness with which ginny had come up with this lie ginny shrugged and said fred and george were planning to do it before they left 
 
 ok said hermione well then harry you and i will be under the invisibility cloak and sneak into the office and you can talk to sirius 
 
 not there hermione 
 
 i mean you can can check whether sirius is at home or not while i keep watch i think you should be in there alone already proved the windows a weak spot sending those nifflers through it 
 
 even through his anger and impatience harry recognised offer to accompany him into office as a sign of solidarity and loyalty 
 
 i ok thanks he muttered 
 
 right well even if we do all of that i think going to be able to bank on more than five minutes said hermione looking relieved that harry seemed to have accepted the plan not with filch and the wretched inquisitorial squad floating around 
 
 five be enough said harry go 
 
 now said hermione looking shocked 
 
 of course now said harry angrily what did you think going to wait until after dinner or something hermione sirius is being tortured right now 
 
 ioh all right she said desperately you go and get the invisibility cloak and meet you at the end of corridor ok 
 
 harry answer but flung himself out of the room and began to fight his way through the milling crowds outside two floors up he met seamus and dean who hailed him jovially and told him they were planning a celebration in the common room harry barely heard them he scrambled through the portrait hole while they were still arguing about how many butterbeers they would need and was climbing back out of it the invisibility cloak and knife secure in his bag before they noticed he had left them 
 
 harry want to chip in a couple of galleons harold dingle reckons he could sell us some firewhisky 
 
 but harry was already tearing away back along the corridor and a couple of minutes later was jumping the last few stairs to join ron hermione ginny and luna who were huddled together at the end of corridor 
 
 got it he panted ready to go then 
 
 all right whispered hermione as a gang of loud passed them so ronyou go and head umbridge off ginny luna if you can start moving people out of the corridor harry and i will get the cloak on and wait until the coast is clear 
 
 ron strode away his hair visible right to the end of the passage meanwhile equally vivid head bobbed between the jostling students surrounding them in the other direction trailed by blonde one 
 
 get over here muttered hermione tugging at wrist and pulling him back into a recess where the ugly stone head of a medieval wizard stood muttering to itself on a column areare you sure ok harry still very pale 
 
 fine he said shortly tugging the invisibility cloak from out of his bag in truth his scar was aching but not so badly that he thought voldemort had yet dealt sirius a fatal blow it had hurt much worse than this when voldemort had been punishing avery 
 
 here he said he threw the invisibility cloak over both of them and they stood listening carefully over the latin mumblings of the bust in front of them 
 
 you come down here ginny was calling to the crowd no sorry going to have to go round by the swivelling staircase let off garrotting gas just along here 
 
 they could hear people complaining one surly voice said i see no gas 
 
 because colourless said ginny in a convincingly exasperated voice but if you want to walk through it carry on then have your body as proof for the next idiot who believe us 
 
 slowly the crowd thinned the news about the garrotting gas seemed to have spread people were not coming this way any more when at last the surrounding area was quite clear hermione said quietly i think as good as going to get harrycome on do it 
 
 they moved forwards covered by the cloak luna was standing with her back to them at the far end of the corridor as they passed ginny hermione whispered good one forget the signal 
 
 the signal muttered harry as they approached door 
 
 a loud chorus of weasley is our king if they see umbridge coming replied hermione as harry inserted the blade of knife in the crack between door and wall the lock clicked open and they entered the office 
 
 the garish kittens were basking in the sunshine that was warming their plates but otherwise the office was as still and unoccupied as last time hermione breathed a sigh of relief 
 
 i thought she might have added extra security after the second niffler 
 
 they pulled off the cloak hermione hurried over to the window and stood out of sight peering down into the grounds with her wand out harry dashed over to the fireplace seized the pot of floo powder and threw a pinch into the grate causing emerald flames to burst into life there he knelt down quickly thrust his head into the dancing fire and cried number twelve grimmauld place 
 
 his head began to spin as though he had just got off a fairground ride though his knees remained firmly planted on the cold office floor he kept his eyes screwed up against the whirling ash and when the spinning stopped he opened them to find himself looking out at the long cold kitchen of grimmauld place 
 
 there was nobody there he had expected this yet was not prepared for the molten wave of dread and panic that seemed to burst through his stomach at the sight of the deserted room 
 
 sirius he shouted sirius are you there 
 
 his voice echoed around the room but there was no answer except a tiny scuffing sound to the right of the fire 
 
 there he called wondering whether it was just a mouse 
 
 kreacher the crept into view he looked highly delighted about something though he seemed to have recently sustained a nasty injury to both hands which were heavily bandaged 
 
 the potter head in the fire kreacher informed the empty kitchen stealing furtive oddly triumphant glances at harry what has he come for kreacher wonders 
 
 sirius kreacher harry demanded 
 
 the gave a wheezy chuckle 
 
 master has gone out harry potter 
 
 he gone he gone kreacher 
 
 kreacher merely cackled 
 
 warning you said harry fully aware that his scope for inflicting punishment upon kreacher was almost in this position what about lupin any of them are any of them there 
 
 nobody here but kreacher said the elf gleefully and turning away from harry he began to walk slowly towards the door at the end of the kitchen kreacher thinks he will have a little chat with his mistress now yes he had a chance in a long time master has been keeping him away from her 
 
 where has sirius gone harry yelled after the elf kreacher has he gone to the department of mysteries 
 
 kreacher stopped in his tracks harry could just make out the back of his bald head through the forest of chair legs before him 
 
 master does not tell poor kreacher where he is going said the elf quietly 
 
 but you know shouted harry you you know where he is 
 
 there was a silence then the elf let out his loudest cackle yet 
 
 master will not come back from the department of mysteries he said gleefully kreacher and his mistress are alone again 
 
 and he scurried forwards and disappeared through the door to the hall 
 
 you 
 
 but before he could utter a single curse or insult harry felt a great pain at the top of his head he inhaled a lot of ash and choking found himself being dragged backwards through the flames until with a horrible abruptness he was staring up into the wide pallid face of professor umbridge who had dragged him backwards out of the fire by the hair and was now bending his neck back as far as it would go as though she were going to slit his throat 
 
 you think she whispered bending neck back even further so that he was looking up at the ceiling that after two nifflers i was going to let one more foul scavenging little creature enter my office without my knowledge i had stealth sensoring spells placed all around my doorway after the last one got in you foolish boy take his wand she barked at someone he could not see and he felt a hand grope inside the chest pocket of his robes and remove the wand hers too 
 
 harry heard a scuffle over by the door and knew that hermione had also just had her wand wrested from her 
 
 i want to know why you are in my office said umbridge shaking the fist clutching his hair so that he staggered 
 
 i wastrying to get my firebolt harry croaked 
 
 liar she shook his head again your firebolt is under strict guard in the dungeons as you very well know potter you had your head in my fire with whom have you been communicating 
 
 no one said harry trying to pull away from her he felt several hairs part company with his scalp 
 
 liar shouted umbridge she threw him from her and he slammed into the desk now he could see hermione pinioned against the wall by millicent bulstrode malfoy was leaning on the windowsill smirking as he threw wand into the air and caught it again 
 
 there was a commotion outside and several large slytherins entered each gripping ron ginny luna andto bewildermentneville who was trapped in a stranglehold by crabbe and looked in imminent danger of suffocation all four of them had been gagged 
 
 got em all said warrington shoving ron roughly forwards into the room that one he poked a thick finger at neville tried to stop me taking her he pointed at ginny who was trying to kick the shins of the large slytherin girl holding her so i brought him along too 
 
 good good said umbridge watching struggles well it looks as though hogwarts will shortly be a zone it 
 
 malfoy laughed loudly and sycophantically umbridge gave her wide complacent smile and settled herself into a armchair blinking up at her captives like a toad in a flowerbed 
 
 so potter she said you stationed lookouts around my office and you sent this buffoon she nodded at ronmalfoy laughed even tell me the poltergeist was wreaking havoc in the transfiguration department when i knew perfectly well that he was busy smearing ink on the eyepieces of all the school telescopes mr filch having just informed me so 
 
 clearly it was very important for you to talk to somebody was it albus dumbledore or the hagrid i doubt it was minerva mcgonagall i hear she is still too ill to talk to anyone 
 
 malfoy and a few of the other members of the inquisitorial squad laughed some more at that harry found he was so full of rage and hatred he was shaking 
 
 none of your business who i talk to he snarled 
 
 slack face seemed to tighten 
 
 very well she said in her most dangerous and falsely sweet voice very well mr potter i offered you the chance to tell me freely you refused i have no alternative but to force you draco fetch professor snape 
 
 malfoy slowed wand inside his robes and left the room smirking but harry hardly noticed he had just realised something he could not believe he had been so stupid as to forget it he had thought that all the members of the order all those who could help him save sirius were gonebut he had been wrong there was still a member of the order of the phoenix at hogwartssnape 
 
 there was silence in the office except for the fidgetings and scufflings resulting from the slytherins efforts to keep ron and the others under control lip was bleeding on to carpet as he struggled against ginny was still trying to stamp on the feel of the girl who had both her upper arms in a tight grip neville was turning steadily more purple in the face while lugging at arms and hermione was attempting in vain to throw millicent bulstrode off her luna however stood limply by the side of her captor gazing vaguely out of the window as though rather bored by the proceedings 
 
 harry looked back at umbridge who was watching him closely he kept his face deliberately smooth and blank as footsteps were heard in the corridor outside and draco malfoy entered the room closely followed by snape 
 
 you wanted to see me headmistress said snape looking around at all the pairs of struggling students with an expression of complete indifference 
 
 ah professor snape said umbridge smiling widely and standing up again yes i would like another bottle of veritaserum as quick as you can please 
 
 you took my last bottle to interrogate potter he said surveying her coolly through his greasy curtains of black hair surely you did not use it all i told you that three drops would be sufficient 
 
 umbridge flushed 
 
 you can make some more you she said her voice becoming more sweetly girlish as it always did when she was furious 
 
 certainly said snape his lip curling it takes a full to mature so i should have it ready for you in around a month 
 
 a month squawked umbndge swelling toadishly a i need it this evening snape i have just found potter using my fire to communicate with a person or persons unknown 
 
 really said snape showing his first faint sign of interest as he looked round at harry well it surprise me potter has never shown much inclination to follow school rules 
 
 his cold dark eyes were boring into who met his gaze unflinchingly concentrating hard on what he had seen in his dream willing snape to read it in his mind to understand 
 
 i wish to interrogate him repeated umbridge angrily and snape looked away from harry back into her furiously quivering lace i wish you to provide me with a potion that will force him to tell me the truth 
 
 i have already told you said snape smoothly that i have no further stocks of veritaserum unless you wish to poison potterand i assure you i would have the greatest sympathy with you if you didi cannot help you the only trouble is that most venoms act too fast to give the victim much lime for 
 
 snape looked back at harry who stared at him frantic to communicate without words 
 
 got sirius in the department of mysteries he thought desperately got sirius 
 
 you are on probation shrieked professor umbridge and snape looked back at her his eyebrows slightly raised you arc being deliberately unhelpful i expected better lucius malfoy always speaks most highly of you now get out of my office 
 
 snape gave her an ironic bow and turned to leave harry knew his last chance of letting the order know what was going on was walking out of the door 
 
 got padfoot he shouted got padfoot at the place where hidden 
 
 snape had stopped with his hand on door handle 
 
 padfoot cried professor umbridge looking eagerly from harry to snape what is padfoot where what is hidden what does he mean snape 
 
 snape looked round at harry his face was inscrutable harry could not tell whether he had understood or not but he did not dare speak more plainly in front of umbridge 
 
 i have no idea said snape coldly potter when i want nonsense shouted at me i shall give you a babbling beverage and crabbe loosen your hold a little if longbottom suffocates it will mean a lot of tedious paperwork and i am afraid i shall have to mention it on your reference if ever you apply for a job 
 
 he closed the door behind him with a snap leaving harry in a state of worse turmoil than before snape had been his very last hope he looked at umbridge who seemed to be feeling the same way her chest was heaving with rage and frustration 
 
 very well she said and she pulled out her wand very well i am left with no alternative this is more than a matter of school discipline this is an issue of ministry security yes yes 
 
 she seemed to be talking herself into something she was shifting her weight nervously from foot to foot staring at harry beating her wand against her empty palm and breathing heavily as he watched her harry felt horribly powerless without his own wand 
 
 you are forcing me potter i do not want to said umbridge still moving restlessly on the spot but sometimes circumstances justify the use i am sure the minister will understand that i had no choice 
 
 malfoy was watching her with a hungry expression on his face 
 
 the cruciatus curse ought to loosen your tongue said umbridge quietly 
 
 no shrieked hermione professor illegal 
 
 but umbridge took no notice there was a nasty eager excited look on her face that harry had never seen before she raised her wand 
 
 the minister want you to break the law professor umbridge cried hermione 
 
 what cornelius know hurt him said umbridge who was now panting slightly as she pointed her wand at different parts of body in turn apparently trying to decide where it would hurt most he never knew i ordered dementors to go after potter last summer but he was delighted to be given the chance to expel him all the same 
 
 it was you gasped harry you sent the dementors after me 
 
 somebody had to act breathed umbridge as her wand came to rest pointing directly at forehead they were all bleating about silencing you somehowdiscrediting you but i was the one who actually did something about it only you wriggled out of that one you potter not today though not now and taking a deep breath she cried cruc 
 
 no shouted hermione in a cracked voice from behind millicent bulstrode noharry have to tell her 
 
 no way yelled harry staring at the little of hermione he could see 
 
 have to harry force it out of you anyway the point 
 
 and hermione began to cry weakly into the back of millicent robes millicent stopped trying to squash her against the wall immediately and dodged out of her way looking disgusted 
 
 well well well said umbridge looking triumphant little miss is going to give us some answers come on then girl come on 
 
 ermynee no shouted ron through his gag 
 
 ginny was staring at hermione as though she had never seen her before neville still choking for breath was gazing at her too but harry had just noticed something though hermione was sobbing desperately into her hands there was no trace of a tear 
 
 sorry everyone said hermione buti stand it 
 
 right right girl said umbridge seizing hermione by the shoulders thrusting her into the abandoned chintz chair and leaning over her now then with whom was potter communicating just now 
 
 well gulped hermione into her hands well he was trying to speak to professor dumbledore 
 
 ron froze his eyes wide ginny stopped trying to stamp on her slytherin toes and even luna looked mildly surprised fortunately the attention of umbridge and her minions was focused too exclusively upon hermione to notice these suspicious signs 
 
 dumbledore said umbridge eagerly you know where dumbledore is then 
 
 well no sobbed hermione tried the leaky cauldron in diagon alley and the three broomsticks and even the head 
 
 idiot girl dumbledore be sitting in a pub when the whole looking for him shouted umbridge disappointment etched in every sagging line of her face 
 
 butbut we needed to tell him something important wailed hermione holding her hands more tightly over her face not harry knew out of anguish but to disguise the continued absence of tears 
 
 yes said umbridge with a sudden resurgence of excitement what was it you wanted to tell him 
 
 we we wanted to tell him rready choked hermione 
 
 ready demanded umbridge and now she grabbed shoulders again and shook her slightly ready girl 
 
 the the weapon said hermione 
 
 weapon weapon said umbridge and her eyes seemed to pop with excitement you have been developing some method of resistance a weapon you could use against the ministry on professor orders of course 
 
 yyyes gasped hermione but he had to leave before it was finished and nnnow finished it for him and we find him ttto tell him 
 
 what kind of weapon is it said umbridge harshly her stubby hands still tight on shoulders 
 
 we rr really understand it said hermione sniffing loudly we jjjust did what ppprofessor dumbledore told us ttto do 
 
 umbridge straightened up looking exultant 
 
 lead me to the weapon she said 
 
 not showing them said hermione shrilly looking around at the slytherins through her fingers 
 
 it is not for you to set conditions said professor umbridge harshly 
 
 fine said hermione now sobbing into her hands again fine let them see it i hope they use it on you in fact i wish invite loads and loads of people to come and see ththat would serve you rightoh love it if the wh whole school knew where it was and how to uuse it and then if you annoy any of them be able to ssort you out 
 
 these words had a powerful impact on umbridge she glanced swiftly and suspiciously around at her inquisitorial squad her bulging eyes resting for a moment on malfoy who was too slow to disguise the look of eagerness and greed that had appeared on his face 
 
 umbridge contemplated hermione for another long moment then spoke in what she clearly thought was a motherly voice 
 
 all right dear make it just you and me and take potter too shall we get up now 
 
 professor said malfoy eagerly professor umbridge i think some of the squad should come with you to look after 
 
 i am a fully qualified ministry official malfoy do you really think i cannot manage two wandless teenagers alone asked umbridge sharply in any case it does not sound as though this weapon is something that schoolchildren should see you will remain here until i return and make sure none of these she gestured around at ron ginny neville and luna escape 
 
 all right said malfoy looking sulky and disappointed 
 
 and you two can go ahead of me and show me the way said umbridge pointing at harry and hermione with her wand lead on

lionfish nov chapter the elder wandcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 the world had ended so why had the battle not ceased the castle fallen silent in horror and every combatant laid down their arms harrys mind was in free fall spinning out of control unable to grasp the impossibility because fred weasley could not be dead the evidence of all his senses must be lyingcand then a body fell past the hole blown into the side of the school and curses flew in at them from the darkness hitting the wall behind their heads 
 
 get down harry shouted as more curses flew through the night he and ron had both grabbed hermione and pulled her to the floor but percy lay across freds body shielding it from further harm and when harry shouted percy come on weve got to move he shook his head 
 
 percy harry saw tear tracks streaking the grime coating rons face as he seized his elder brothers shoulders and pulled but percy would not budge percy you cant do anything for him were going toc 
 
 hermione screamed and harry turning did not need to ask why a monstrous spider the size of a small car was trying to climb through the huge hole in the wall one of aragogs descendants had joined the fight 
 
 ron and harry shouted together their spells collided and the monster was blown backward its legs jerking horribly and vanished into the darkness 
 
 it brought friends harry called to the others glancing over the edge of the castle through the hole in the wall the curses had blasted more giant spiders were climbing the side of the building liberated from the forbidden forest into which the death eaters must have penetrated harry fired stunning spells down upon them knocking the lead monster into its fellows so that they rolled back down the building and out of sight then more curses came soaring over harrys head so close he felt the force of them blow his hair 
 
 lets move now 
 
 pushing hermione ahead of him with ron harry stooped to seize freds body under the armpit percy realizing what harry was trying to do stopped clinging to the body and helped together crouching low to avoid the curses flying at them from the grounds they hauled fred out of the way 
 
 here said harry and they placed him in a niche where a suit of armor had stood earlier he could not bear to look at fred a second longer than he had to and after making sure that the body was he took off after ron and hermione malfoy and goyle had vanished but at the end of the corridor which was now full of dust and falling masonry glass long gone from windows he saw many people running backward and forward whether friends or foes he could not tell rounding the corner percy let out a roar rookwood and sprinted off in the direction of a tall man who was pursuing a couple of students harry in here hermione screamed 
 
 she had pulled ron behind a tapestry they seemed to be wrestling together and for one mad second harry thought that they were embracing again then he saw that hermione was trying to restrain ron to stop him running after percy 
 
 listen to me c listen ron 
 
 i wanna help c i wanna kill death eatersc 
 
 his face was contorted smeared with dust and smoke and he was shaking with rage and grief 
 
 ron were the only ones who can end it please c ron c we need the snake weve got to kill the snake said hermione 
 
 but harry knew how ron felt pursuing another horcrux could not bring the satisfaction of revenge he too wanted to fight to punish them the people who had killed fred and he wanted to find the other weasleys and above all make sure make quite sure that ginny was not c but he could not permit that idea to form in his mind c we will fight hermione said well have to to reach the snake but lets not lose sight now of what were supposed to be were the only ones who can end it 
 
 she was crying too and she wiped her face on her torn and singed sleeve as she spoke but she took great heaving breaths to calm herself as still keeping a tight hold on ron she turned to harry 
 
 you need to find out where voldemort is because hell have the snake with him wont he do it harry c look inside him 
 
 why was it so easy because his scar had been burning for hours yearning to show him voldemorts thoughts he closed his eyes on her command and at once the screams and bangs and all the discordant sounds of the battle were drowned until they became distant as though he stood far far away from them 
 
 
 
 
 he was standing in the middle of a desolate but strangely familiar room with peeling paper on the walls and all the windows boarded up except for one the sounds of the assault on the castle were muffled and distant the single unblocked window revealed distant bursts of light where the castle stood but inside the room was dark except for a solitary oil lamp 
 
 he was rolling his wand between his fingers watching it his thoughts on the room in the castle the secret room only he had ever found the room like the chamber that you had to be clever and cunning and inquisitive to discoverhe was confident that the boy would not find the diademalthough dumbledores puppet had come much farther than he ever expectedtoo far 
 
 my lord said a voice desperate and cracked he turned there was lucius malfoy sitting in the darkest corner ragged and still bearing the marks of the punishment he had received after the boys last escape one of his eyes remained closed and puffy my lordpleasemy son 
 
 if your son is dead lucius it is not my fault he did not come and join me like the rest of the slytherins perhaps he has decided to befriend harry potter 
 
 no c never whispered malfoy you must hope not 
 
 arent c arent you afraid my lord that potter might die at another hand but yours asked malfoy his voice shaking wouldnt it beforgive memore prudent to call off this battle enter the castle and seek him 
 
 do not pretend lucius you wish the battle to cease so that you can discover what has happened to your son and i do not need to seek potter before the night is out potter will have come to find me 
 
 voldemort dropped his gaze once more to the wand in his fingers it troubled himand those things that troubled lord voldemort needed to be rearrangedgo and fetch snape 
 
 snape lord 
 
 snape now i need him there is a c service c i require from him go 
 
 frightened stumbling a little through the gloom lucius left the room vodlemort continued to stand there twirling the wand between his fingers staring at it 
 
 it is the only way nagini he whispered and he looked around and there was the great thick snake now suspended in midair twisting gracefully within the enchanted protected space he had made for her a starry transparent sphere somewhere between a glittering cage and a tank 
 
 with a gasp harry pulled back and opened his yees at the same moment his ears were assaulted with the screeches and cries the smashes and bangs of battle 
 
 hes in the shrieking shack the snakes with him its got some sort of magical protection around it hes just sent lucius malfoy to find snape 
 
 voldemorts sitting in the shrieking shack said hermione outraged hes not c hes not even fighting 
 
 he doesnt think he needs to fight said harry he thinks im going to go to him 
 
 but why 
 
 he knows im after horcruxes c hes keeping nagini close beside him c obviously im going to have to go to him to get near the thingc 
 
 right said ron squaring his shoulders so you cant go thats what he wants what hes expecting you stay here and look after hermione and ill go and get itc harry cut across ron 
 
 you two stay here ill go under the cloak and ill be back as soon as ic 
 
 no said hermione it makes much more sense if i take the cloak andc 
 
 dont even think about it ron snarled at her before hermione could get farther than ron im just as capable c the tapestry at the top of the staircase on which they stood was ripped open 
 
 potter 
 
 two masked death eaters stood there but even before their wands were fully raised hermione shouted glisseo 
 
 the stairs beneath their feet flattened into a chute and she harry and ron hurtled down it unable to control their speed but so fast that the death eaters stunning spells flew far over their heads they shot through the concealing tapestry at the bottom and spun onto the floor hitting the opposite wall 
 
 duro cried hermione pointing her wand at the tapestry and there were two loud sickening crunches as the tapestry turned to stone and the death eaters pursuing them crumpled against it 
 
 get back shouted ron and he harry and hermione hurled themselves against a door as a herd of galloping desks thundered past shepherded by a sprinting professor mcgonagall she appeared not to notice them her hair had come down and there was a gash on her cheek as she turned the corner they heard her scream 
 
 charge 
 
 harry you get the cloak on said hermione never mind usc 
 
 but he threw it over all three of them large though they were he doubted anyone would see their disembodied feet through the dust that clogged the air the falling stone the shimmer of spells they ran down the next staircase and found themselves in a corridor full of duelers the portraits on either side of the fighters were crammed with figures screaming advice and encouragement while death eaters both masked and unmasked dueled students and teachers dean had won himself a wand for he was with dolohov parvati with travers harry ron and hermione raised their wands at once ready to strike but the duelers were weaving and darting so much that there was a strong likelihood of hurting on of their own side if they cast curses even as they stood braced looking for the opportunity to act there came a great wheeeeee and looking up harry saw peeves zooming over them dropping snargaluff pods down onto the death eaters whose heads were suddenly engulfed in wriggling green tubers like fat worms 
 
 argh 
 
 a fistful of tubers had hit the cloak over rons head the damp green roots were suspended improbably in midair as ron tried to shake them loose 
 
 someones invisible there shouted a masked death eater pointing 
 
 dean made the most of the death eaters momentary distraction knocking him out with a stunning spell dolohov attempted to retaliate and parvati shot a body bind curse at him lets go harry yelled and he ron and hermione gathered the cloak tightly around themselves and pelted heads down through the midst of the fighters slipping a little in pools of snargaluff juice toward the top of the marble staircase into the entrance hall 
 
 im draco malfoy im draco im on your side draco was on the upper landing pleading with another masked death eater harry stunned the death eater as they passed malfoy looked around beaming for his savior and ron punched him from under the cloak malfoy fell backward on top of the death eater his mouth bleeding utterly bemused 
 
 and thats the second time weve saved your life tonight you bastard ron yelled 
 
 there were more duelers all over the stairs and in the hall death eaters everywhere harry looked yaxley close to the front doors in combat with flitwick a masked death eater dueling kingsley right beside them students ran in every direction some carrying or dragging injured friends harry directed a stunning spell toward the masked death eater it missed but nearly hit neville who had emerged from nowhere brandishing armfuls of venomous tentacula which looped itself happily around the nearest death eater and began reeling him in 
 
 harry ron and hermione sped won the marble staircase glass shattered on the left and the slytherin hourglass that had recorded house points spilled its emeralds everywhere so that people slipped and staggered as they ran two bodies fell from the balcony overhead as they reached the ground a gray blur that harry took for an animal sped across the hall to sink its teeth into one of the fallen 
 
 no shrieked hermione and with a deafening blast from her wand fenrir greyback was thrown backward from the feebly struggling body of lavender brown he hit the marble banisters and struggled to return to his feet then with a bright white flash and a crack a crystal ball fell on top of his head and he crumpled to the ground and did not move 
 
 i have more shrieked professor trelawney from over the banisters more for any who want them herec and with a move like a tennis serve she heaved another enormous crystal sphere from her bag waved her wand through the air and caused the ball to speed across the hall and smash through a window at the same moment the heavy wooden front doors burst open and more of the gigantic spiders forced their way into the front hall 
 
 screams of terror rent the air the fighters scattered death eaters and hogwartians alike and red and green jets of light flew into the midst of the oncoming monsters which shuddered and reared more terrifying than ever 
 
 how do we get out yelled ron over all the screaming but before either harry or hermione could answer they were bowled aside hagrid had come thundering down the stairs brandishing his flowery pink umbrella 
 
 dont hurt em dont hurt em he yelled 
 
 hagrid no 
 
 harry forgot everything else he sprinted out from under the cloak running bent double to avoid the curses illuminating the whole hall 
 
 hagrid come back 
 
 but he was not even halfway to hagrid when he saw it happen hagrid vanished amongst the spiders and with a great scurrying a foul swarming movement they retreated under the onslaught of spells hagrid buried in their midst 
 
 hagrid harry heard someone calling his own name whether friend or foe he did not care he was springing down the front steps into the dark grounds and the spiders were swarming away with their prey and he could see nothing of hagrid at all 
 
 hagrid 
 
 he thought he could make out an enormous arm waving from the midst of the spider swarm but as he made to chase after them his way was impeded by a monumental foot which swung down out of the darkness and made the ground on which he stood shudder he looked up a giant stood before him twenty feet high its head hidden in shadow nothing but its treelike hairy shins illuminated by light from the castle doors with one brutal fluid movement it smashed a massive fist through an upper window and glass rained down upon harry forcing him back under the shelter of the doorway 
 
 oh myc shrieked hermione as she and ron caught up with harry and gazed upward at the giant now trying to seize people through the window above 
 
 dont ron yelled grabbing hermiones hand as she raised her wand stun him and hell crush half the castlec 
 
 hagger 
 
 grawp came lurching around the corner of the castle only now did harry realize that grawp was indeed an undersized giant the gargantuan monster trying to crush people on the upper floors turned around and let out a roar the stone steps trembled as he stomped toward his smaller kin and grawps lopsided mouth fell open showing yellow half teeth and then they launched themselves at each other with the savagery of lions 
 
 run harry roared the night was full of hideous yells and blows as the giants wrestled and he seized hermiones hand and tore down the steps into the grounds ron bringing up the rear harry had not lost hope of finding and saving hagrid he ran so fast that they were halfway toward the forest before they were brought up short again 
 
 the air around them had frozen harrys breath caught and solidified in his chest shapes moved out in the darkness swirling figures of concentrated blackness moving in a great wave towards the castles their faces hooded and their breath rattling 
 
 ron and hermione closed in beside him as the sounds of fighting behind them grew suddenly muted deadened because a silence only dementors could bring was falling thickly through the night and fred was gone and hagrid was surely dying or already dead 
 
 come on harry said hermiones voice from a very long way away 
 
 patronuses harry come on 
 
 he raised his wand but a dull hopelessness was spreading throughout him how many more lay dead that he did not yet know about he felt as though his soul had already half left his body 
 
 harry come on screamed hermione 
 
 a hundred dementors were advancing gliding toward them sucking their way closer to harrys despair which was like a promise of a feast 
 
 he saw rons silver terrier burst into the air flicker feebly and expire he saw hermiones otter twist in midair and fade and his own wand trembled in his hand and he almost welcomed the oncoming oblivion the promise of nothing of no feeling 
 
 and then a silver hare a boar and fox soared past harry ron and hermiones heads the dementors fell back before the creatures approach three more people had arrived out of the darkness to stand beside them their wands outstretched continuing to cast patronuses luna ernie and seamus 
 
 thats right said luna encouragingly as if they were back in the room of requirement and this was simply spell practice for the thats right harrycome on think of something happy 
 
 something happy he said his voice cracked 
 
 were all still here she whispered still fighting come on now 
 
 there was a silver spark then a wavering light and then with the greatest effort it had ever cost him the stag burst from the end of harrys wand it cantered forward and now the dementors scattered in earnest and immediately the night was mild again but the sounds of the surrounding battle were loud in his ears 
 
 cant thank you enough said ron shakily turning to luna ernie and seamus you just savedc 
 
 with a roar and an tremor another giant came lurching out of the darkness from the direction of the forest brandishing a club taller than any of them 
 
 run harry shouted again but the others needed no telling they all scattered and not a second too soon for the next moment the creatures vast foot had fallen exactly where they had been standing harry looked round ron and hermione were following him but the other three had vanished back into the battle lets get out of range yelled ron as the giant swung its club again and its bellows echoed through the night across the grounds where bursts of red and green light continued to illuminate the darkness 
 
 the whomping willow said harry go somehow he walled it all up in his mind crammed it into a small space into which he could not look now thoughts of fred and hagrid and his terror for all the people he loved scattered in and outside the castle must all wait because they had to run had to reach the snake and voldemort because that was as hermione said the only way to end it c 
 
 he sprinted he could outdistance death itself ignoring the jets of light flying in the darkness all around him and the sound of the lake crashing like the sea and the creaking of the forbidden forest though the night was windless through grounds that seemed themselves to have risen in rebellion he ran faster than he had ever moved in his life and it was he who saw the great tree first the willow that protected the secret at its roots with whiplike slashing branches panting and gasping harry slowed down skirting the willows swiping branches peering through the darkness toward its tick trunk trying to see the single knot in the bark of the old tree that would paralyze it ron and hermione caught up hermione so out of breath that she could not speak 
 
 how c howre we going to get in panted ron i can c see the place c if we just had c crookshanks again c 
 
 crookshanks wheezed hermione bent double clutching her chest are you a wizard or what 
 
 oh c right c yeah c 
 
 ron looked around then directed his wand at a twig on the ground and said winguardium leviosa the twig flew up from the ground spun through the air as if caught by a gust of wind then zoomed directly at the trunk through the willows ominously swaying branches it jabbed at a place near the roots and at once the writhing tree became still perfect panted hermione wait 
 
 for one teetering second while the crashes and booms of the battle filled the air harry hesitated voldemort wanted him to do this wanted him to comewas he leading ron and hermione into a trap but the reality seemed to close upon him cruel and plain the only way forward was to kill the snake and the snake was where voldemort was and voldemort was at the end of this tunnel 
 
 harry were coming just get in there said ron pushing him forward 
 
 harry wriggled into the earthy passage hidden in the trees roots 
 
 it was a much tighter squeeze than it had been the last time they had entered it the tunnel was they had had to double up to move through it nearly four years previously now there was nothing for it but to crawl harry went first his wand illuminated expecting at any moment to meet barriers but none came they moved in silence harrys gaze fixed upon the swinging beam of the wand held in his fist at last the tunnel began to slope upward and harry saw a sliver of light ahead hermione tugged at his ankle 
 
 the cloak she whispered put the cloak on 
 
 he groped behind him and she forced the bundle of slippery cloth into his free hand with difficulty he dragged it over himself murmured nox extinguishing his wandlight and continued on his hands and knees as silently as possible all his senses straining expecting every second to be discovered to hear a cold clear voice see a flash of green light 
 
 
 
 
 and then he heard voices coming from the room directly ahead of them only slightly muffled by the fact that the opening at the end of the tunnel had been blocked up by what looked like an old crate hardly daring to breathe harry edged right up tot he opening and peered through a tiny gap left between crate and wall 
 
 the room beyond was dimly lit but he could see nagini swirling and coiling like a serpent underwater safe in her enchanted starry sphere which floated unsupported in midair he could see the edge of a table and a white hand toying with a wand 
 
 then snape spoke and harrys heart lurched snape was inches away from where he crouched hidden 
 
 my lord their resistance is crumbling c 
 
 c and it is doing so without your help said voldemort in his high clear voice skilled wizard though you are severus i do not think you will make much difference now we are almost therealmost 
 
 let me find the boy let me bring you potter i know i can find him my lord please 
 
 snape strode past the gap and harry drew back a little keeping his eyes fixed upon nagini wondering whether there was any spell that might penetrate the protection surrounding her but he could not think of anything one failed attempt and he would give away his position 
 
 voldemort stood up harry could see him now see the red eyes the flattened serpentine face the pallor of him gleaming slightly in the semidarkness 
 
 i have a problem severus said voldemort softly 
 
 my lord said snape 
 
 voldemort raised the elder wand holding it as delicately and precisely as a conductors baton 
 
 why doesnt it work for me severus 
 
 in the silence harry imagined he could hear the snake hissing slightly as it coiled and uncoiledcor was it voldemorts sibilant sigh lingering on the air 
 
 my c my lord said snape blankly i do not understand you c you have performed extraordinary magic with that wand 
 
 no said voldemort i have performed my usual magic i am extraordinary but this wandno it has not revealed the wonders it has promised i feel no difference between this wand and the one i procured from ollivander all those years ago 
 
 voldemorts tone was musing calm but harrys scar had begun to throb and pulse pain was building in his forehead and he could feel that controlled sense of fury building inside voldemort 
 
 no difference said voldemort again 
 
 snape did not speak harry could not see his face he wondered whether snape sensed danger was trying to find the right words to reassure his master 
 
 voldemort started to move around the room harry lost sight of him for seconds as he prowled speaking in that same measured voice while the pain and fury mounted in harry 
 
 i have thought long and hard severusdo you know why i have called you back from battle 
 
 and for a moment harry saw snapes profile his eyes were fixed upon the coiling snake in its enchanted cage 
 
 no my lord but i beg you will let me return let me find potter 
 
 you sound like lucius neither of you understands potter as i do he does not need finding potter will come to me i knew his weakness you see his one great flaw he will hate watching the others struck down around him knowing that it is for him that it happens he will want to stop it at any cost he will come 
 
 but my lord he might be killed accidentally by someone other than yourselfc 
 
 my instructions to the death eaters have been perfectly clear capture potter kill his friends c the more the better c but do not kill him 
 
 but it is of you that i wished to speak severus not harry potter you have been very valuable to me very valuable 
 
 my lord knows i seek only to serve him but c let me go and find the boy my lord let me bring him to you i know i can c 
 
 i have told you no said voldemort and harry caught the glint of red in his eyes as he turned again and the swishing of his cloak was like the slithering of a snake and he felt voldemorts impatience in his burning scar my concern at the moment severus is what will happen when i finally meet the boy 
 
 my lord there can be no question surely c 
 
 c but there is a question severus there is 
 
 voldemort halted and harry could see him plainly again as he slid the elder wand through his white fingers staring at snape 
 
 why did both the wands i have used fail when directed at harry potter 
 
 i c i cannot answer that my lord 
 
 cant you 
 
 the stab of rage felt like a spike driven through harrys head he forced his own fist into his mouth to stop himself from crying out in pain he closed his eyes and suddenly he was voldemort looking into snapes pale face 
 
 my wand of yew did everything of which i asked it severus except to kill harry potter twice it failed ollivander told me under torture of the twin cores told me to take anothers wand i did so but luciuss wand shattered upon meeting potters 
 
 i c i have no explanation my lord 
 
 snape was not looking at voldemort now his dark eyes were still fixed upon the coiling serpent in its protective sphere 
 
 i sought a third wand severus the elder wand the wand of destiny the deathstick i took it from its previous master i took it from the grave of albus dumbledore 
 
 and now snape looked at voldemort and snapes face was like a death mask it was marble white and so still that when he spoke it was a shock to see that anyone lived behind the blank eyes 
 
 my lord c let me go to the boy c 
 
 all this long night when i am on the brink of victory i have sat here said voldemort his voice barely louder than a whisper wondering wondering why the elder wand refuses to be what it ought to be refuses to perform as legend says it must perform for its rightful ownerand i think i have the answer 
 
 snape did not speak 
 
 perhaps you already know it you are a clever man after all severus you have been a good and faithful servant and i regret what must happen 
 
 my lordc 
 
 the elder wand cannot serve me properly severus because i am not its true master the elder wand belongs to the wizard who killed its last owner you killed albus dumbledore while you live severus the elder wand cannot truly be mine 
 
 my lord snape protested raising his wand 
 
 it cannot be any other way said voldemort i must master the wand severus master the wand and i master potter at last 
 
 and voldemort swiped the air with the elder wand it did nothing to snape who for a split second seemed to think he had been reprieved but then voldemorts intention became clear the snakes cage was rolling through the air and before snape could do anything more than yell it had encased him head and shoulders and voldemort spoke in parseltongue 
 
 kill 
 
 there was a terrible scream harry saw snapes face losing the little color it had left it whitened as his black eyes widened as the snakes fangs pierced his neck as he failed to push the enchanted cage off himself as his knees gave way and he fell to the floor 
 
 i regret it said voldemort coldly 
 
 he turned away there was no sadness in him no remorse it was time to leave this shack and take charge with a wand that would now do his full bidding he pointed it at the starry cage holding the snake which drifted upward off snape who fell sideways onto the floor blood gushing from the wounds in his neck voldemort swept from the room without a backward glance and the great serpent floated after him in its huge protective sphere 
 
 
 
 
 back in the tunnel and his own mind harry opened his eyes he had drawn blood biting down on his knuckles in an effort not to shout out now he was looking through the tiny crack between crate and wall watching a foot in a black boot trembling on the floor 
 
 harry breathed hermione behind him but he had already pointed his wand at the crate blocking his view it lifted an inch into the air and drifted sideways silently as quietly as he could he pulled himself up into the room 
 
 he did not know why he was doing it why he was approaching the dying man he did not know what he felt as he saw snapes white face and the fingers trying to staunch the bloody wound at his neck harry took off the invisibility cloak and looked down upon the man he hated whose widening black eyes found harry as he cried to speak harry bent over him and snape seized the front of his robes and pulled him close 
 
 a terrible rasping gurgling noise issued from snapes throat 
 
 takeittakeit 
 
 something more than blood was leaking from snape silvery blue neither gas nor liquid it gushed form his mouth and his ears and his eyes and harry knew what it was but did not know what to do c a flask conjured from thin air was thrust into his shaking hand by hermione harry lifted the silvery substance into it with his wand when the flask was full to the brim and snape looked as though there was no blood left in him his grip on harrys robes slackened 
 
 he whispered 
 
 the green eyes found the black but after a second something in the depths of the dark pari seemed to vanish leaving them fixed blank and empty the hand holding harry thudded to the floor and snape moved no more

 there was once an emperor who had a horse shod with gold he had a golden shoe on each foot and why was this he was a beautiful creature with slender legs bright intelligent eyes and a mane that hung down over his neck like a veil he had carried his master through fire and smoke in the with the bullets whistling round him he had kicked and bitten and taken part in the fight when the enemy advanced and with his master on his back he had dashed over the fallen foe and saved the golden crown and the life which was of more value than the brightest gold this is the reason of the horse wearing golden shoes 
 
 a beetle came creeping forth from the stable where the farrier 
 had been shoeing the horse great ones first of course said he 
 
 and then the little ones but size is not always a proof of greatness he stretched out his thin leg as he spoke 
 
 and pray what do you want asked the farrier 
 golden shoes replied the beetle 
 why you must be out of your senses cried the farrier 
 golden shoes for you indeed 
 yes certainly golden shoes replied the beetle am i not just 
 as good as that great creature yonder who is waited upon and brushed and has food and drink placed before him and i belong to the royal stables 
 
 but why does the horse have golden shoes asked the farrier of 
 course you understand the reason 
 
 understand well i understand that it is a personal slight to 
 me cried the beetle it is done to annoy me so i intend to go 
 out into the world and seek my fortune 
 
 go along with you said the farrier 
 
 a rude fellow cried the beetle as he walked out of 
 the stable and then he flew for a short distance till he found 
 himself in a beautiful all fragrant with roses and 
 lavender the with red and black shells on their backs 
 and delicate wings were flying about and one of them said is it 
 not sweet and lovely here oh how beautiful everything is 
 
 i am accustomed to better things said the beetle do you 
 call this beautiful why there is not even a then he went 
 on and under the shadow of a large haystack he found a caterpillar 
 crawling along how beautiful this world is said the caterpillar 
 
 the sun is so warm i quite enjoy it and soon i shall go to sleep 
 and die as they call it but i shall wake up with beautiful wings to 
 fly with like a butterfly 
 
 how conceited you are exclaimed the beetle fly about as a 
 butterfly indeed what of that i have come out of the 
 stable and no one there not even the horse who in 
 fact wears my golden shoes has any idea of flying 
 excepting myself to have wings and fly why i can do that 
 already and so saying he spread his wings and flew away i 
 want to be disgusted he said to himself and yet i help 
 it soon after he fell down upon an extensive lawn and for a time 
 pretended to sleep but at last fell asleep in earnest suddenly a 
 heavy shower of rain came falling from the clouds the beetle woke 
 up with the noise and would have been glad to creep into the earth for 
 shelter but he could not he was tumbled over and over with the rain 
 sometimes swimming on his stomach and sometimes on his back and as for flying that was out of the question he began to doubt whether he should escape with his life so he remained quietly lying where he was after a while the weather cleared up a little and the beetle was able to rub the water from his eyes and look about him 
 he saw something gleaming and he managed to make his way up to it it was linen which had been laid to bleach on the grass he crept into a fold of the damp linen which certainly was not so comfortable a place to lie in as the warm stable but there was nothing better so he 
 remained lying there for a whole day and night and the rain kept on 
 all the time towards morning he crept out of his 
 feeling in a very bad temper with the climate two frogs were 
 sitting on the linen and their bright eyes actually glistened with 
 pleasure 
 
 wonderful weather this cried one of them and so refreshing 
 this linen holds the water together so beautifully that my hind 
 legs quiver as if i were going to swim 
 
 i should like to know said another if the swallow who flies 
 so far in her many journeys to foreign lands ever met with a better 
 climate than this what delicious moisture it is as pleasant as lying 
 in a wet ditch i am sure any one who does not enjoy this has no 
 love for his fatherland 
 
 have you ever been in the stable asked the beetle 
 
 there the moisture is warm and refreshing the climate for me 
 but i could not take it with me on my travels is there not even a 
 dunghill here in this garden where a person of rank like myself 
 could take up his abode and feel at home but the frogs either did 
 not or would not understand him 
 
 i never ask a question twice said the beetle after he had 
 asked this one three times and received no answer then he went on 
 a little farther and stumbled against a piece of broken 
 which certainly ought not to have been lying there but as it was 
 there it formed a good shelter against wind and weather to several 
 families of earwigs who dwelt in it their requirements were not many 
 they were very sociable and full of affection for their children 
 so much so that each mother considered her own child the most 
 beautiful and clever of them all 
 
 our dear son has engaged himself said one mother dear 
 innocent boy his greatest ambition is that he may one day creep 
 into a ear that is a very artless and loveable wish 
 and being engaged will keep him steady what happiness for a mother 
 
 our son said another had scarcely crept out of the egg 
 when he was off on his travels he is all life and spirits i expect 
 he will wear out his horns with running how charming this is for a 
 mother is it not mr beetle for she knew the stranger by his 
 horny coat 
 
 you are both quite right said he so they begged him to walk 
 in that is to come as far as he could under the broken piece of 
 earthenware 
 
 now you shall also see my little earwigs said a third and a 
 fourth mother they are lovely little things and highly amusing 
 they are never except when they are uncomfortable in 
 their inside which unfortunately often happens at their age 
 
 thus each mother spoke of her baby and their babies talked 
 after their own fashion and made use of the little nippers they 
 have in their tails to nip the beard of the beetle 
 
 they are always busy about something the little rogues said 
 the mother beaming with maternal pride but the beetle felt it a 
 bore and he therefore inquired the way to the nearest 
 that is quite out in the great world on the other side of the 
 ditch answered an earwig i hope none of my children will ever go 
 so far it would be the death of me 
 
 but i shall try to get so far said the beetle and he walked 
 off without taking any formal leave which is considered a polite 
 thing to do 
 
 when he arrived at the ditch he met several friends all them 
 beetles we live here they said and we are very comfortable 
 may we ask you to step down into this rich mud you must be fatigued after your journey 
 
 certainly said the beetle i shall be most happy i have 
 been exposed to the rain and have had to lie upon linen and 
 cleanliness is a thing that greatly exhausts me i have also pains 
 in one of my wings from standing in the draught under a piece of 
 broken crockery it is really quite refreshing to be with own 
 kindred again 
 
 perhaps you came from a observed the oldest of them 
 
 no indeed i came from a much grander place replied the 
 beetle i came from the stable where i was born with 
 golden shoes on my feet i am travelling on a secret embassy but 
 you must not ask me any questions for i cannot betray my secret 
 then the beetle stepped down into the rich mud where sat three 
 beetles who tittered because they did not know what to 
 say 
 
 none of them are engaged yet said their mother and the 
 beetle maidens tittered again this time quite in confusion 
 
 i have never seen greater beauties even in the royal stables 
 exclaimed the beetle who was now resting himself 
 
 spoil my girls said the mother and talk to 
 them pray unless you have serious intentions 
 
 but of course the intentions were serious and after a 
 while our friend was engaged the mother gave them her blessing and all the other beetles cried hurrah 
 
 immediately after the betrothal came the marriage for there was 
 no reason to delay the following day passed very pleasantly and 
 the next was tolerably comfortable but on the third it became 
 necessary for him to think of getting food for his wife and perhaps 
 for children 
 
 i have allowed myself to be taken in said our beetle to himself and now nothing to be done but to take them in in 
 return 
 
 no sooner said than done away he went and stayed away all day 
 and all night and his wife remained behind a forsaken widow 
 oh said the other beetles this fellow that we have received 
 into our family is nothing but a complete vagabond he has gone away and left his wife a burden upon our hands 
 
 well she can be unmarried again and remain here with my other 
 daughters said the mother fie on the villain that forsook her 
 in the mean time the beetle who had sailed across the ditch on 
 a cabbage leaf had been journeying on the other side in the 
 morning two persons came up to the ditch when they saw him they 
 took him up and turned him over and over looking very learned all the time especially one who was a boy allah sees the black beetle in the black stone and the black rock is not that written in the 
 koran he asked 
 
 then he translated the name into latin and said a 
 great deal upon the nature and history the second 
 person who was older and a scholar proposed to carry the beetle 
 home as they wanted just such good specimens as this our beetle 
 considered this speech a great insult so he flew suddenly out of 
 the hand his wings were dry now so they carried him to a 
 great distance till at last he reached a hothouse where a sash of 
 the glass roof was partly open so he quietly slipped in and buried 
 himself in the warm earth it is very comfortable here he said to 
 himself and soon after fell asleep then he dreamed that the 
 horse was dying and had left him his golden shoes and also promised that he should have two more all this was very delightful and when the beetle woke up he crept forth and looked around him what a splendid place the hothouse was at the back large were growing and the sunlight made the leaves look quite glossy and beneath them what a profusion of luxuriant green and of flowers red like flame yellow as amber or white as snow what a wonderful quantity of plants cried the beetle how good they will taste when they are decayed this is a capital there must certainly be some relations of mine living here i will just see if i can find any one with whom i can associate proud certainly but also proud of being so then he prowled about in the earth and thought what a pleasant dream that was about the dying horse and the golden shoes he had inherited suddenly a hand seized the beetle and squeezed him and turned him round and round 
 
 the little son and his playfellow had come into the 
 hothouse and seeing the beetle wanted to have some fun with him 
 first he was wrapped in a and put into a warm trousers 
 pocket he twisted and turned about with all his might but he got a 
 good squeeze from the hand as a hint for him to keep quiet 
 then the boy went quickly towards a lake that lay at the end of the 
 garden here the beetle was put into an old broken wooden shoe in 
 which a little stick had been fastened upright for a mast and to this 
 mast the beetle was bound with a piece of worsted now he was a 
 sailor and had to sail away the lake was not very large but to 
 the beetle it seemed an ocean and he was so astonished at its size 
 that he fell over on his back and kicked out his legs then the 
 little ship sailed away sometimes the current of the water seized it 
 but whenever it went too far from the shore one of the boys turned 
 up his trousers and went in after it and brought it back to land 
 but at last just as it went merrily out again the two boys were 
 called and so angrily that they hastened to obey and ran away as 
 fast as they could from the pond so that the little ship was left 
 to its fate it was carried away farther and farther from the shore 
 till it reached the open sea this was a terrible prospect for the 
 beetle for he could not escape in consequence of being bound to the 
 mast then a fly came and paid him a visit what beautiful 
 weather said the fly i shall rest here and sun myself you must 
 have a pleasant time of it 
 
 you speak without knowing the facts replied the beetle 
 
 you see that i am a prisoner 
 
 ah but not a prisoner remarked the fly and away he flew 
 well now i know the world said the beetle to himself an 
 abominable world the only respectable person in it first they 
 refuse me my golden shoes then i have to lie on damp linen and to 
 stand in a draught and to crown all they fasten a wife upon me 
 then when i have made a step forward in the world and found out a 
 comfortable position just as i could wish it to be one of these 
 human boys comes and ties me up and leaves me to the mercy of the 
 wild waves while the favorite horse goes prancing about 
 proudly on his golden shoes this vexes me more than anything but 
 it is useless to look for sympathy in this world my career has been 
 very interesting but the use of that if nobody knows 
 anything about it the world does not deserve to be made acquainted 
 with my adventures for it ought to have given me golden shoes when 
 the horse was shod and i stretched out my feet to be 
 shod too if i had received golden shoes i should have been an 
 ornament to the stable now i am lost to the stable and to the 
 world it is all over with me 
 
 but all was not yet over a boat in which were a few young girls 
 came rowing up look yonder is an old wooden shoe sailing along said one of the younger girls 
 
 and a poor little creature bound fast in it said another 
 
 the boat now came close to our ship and the young 
 girls fished it out of the water one of them drew a small pair of 
 scissors from her pocket and cut the worsted without hurting the 
 beetle and when she stepped on shore she placed him on the grass 
 
 there she said creep away or fly if thou canst it is a 
 splendid thing to have thy liberty away flew the beetle straight 
 through the open window of a large building there he sank down tired and exhausted exactly on the mane of the favorite horse who was standing in his stable and the beetle found himself at home again for some time he clung to the mane that he might recover himself well he said here i am seated on the favorite horse sitting upon him as if i were the emperor himself but what was it the farrier asked me ah i remember now a good 
 thought he asked me why the golden shoes were given to the horse 
 
 the answer is quite clear to me now they were given to the horse 
 on my account and this reflection put the beetle into a good temper 
 
 the rays also came streaming into the stable and shone upon 
 him and made the place lively and bright travelling expands the 
 mind very much said the beetle the world is not so bad after 
 all if you know how to take things as they come

 present progress 
 the sewer is clean cold straight correct 
 it almost realizes the ideal of what is understood in england by the word respectable 
 it is proper and grayish laid out by rule and line one might almost say as though it came out of a bandbox it resembles a tradesman who has become a councillor of state one can almost see distinctly there 
 the mire there comports itself with decency 
 at first one might readily mistake it for one of those subterranean corridors which were so common in former days and so useful in flights of monarchs and princes in those good old times when the people loved their kings the present sewer is a beautiful sewer the pure style reigns there the classical rectilinear alexandrine which driven out of poetry appears to have taken refuge in architecture seems mingled with all the stones of that long dark and whitish vault each outlet is an arcade the rue de rivoli serves as pattern even in the sewer 
 however if the geometrical line is in place anywhere it is certainly in the drainage trench of a great city there everything should be subordinated to the shortest road the sewer has nowadays assumed a certain official aspect the very police reports of which it sometimes forms the subject no longer are wanting in respect towards it 
 the words which characterize it in administrative language are sonorous and dignified what used to be called a gut is now called a gallery what used to be called a hole is now called a surveying orifice 
 villon would no longer meet with his ancient temporary provisional lodging this of cellars has its immemorial population of prowlers rodents swarming in greater numbers than ever from time to time an aged and veteran rat risks his head at the window of the sewer and surveys the parisians but even these vermin grow tame so satisfied are they with their subterranean palace 
 the cesspool no longer retains anything of its primitive ferocity 
 the rain which in former days soiled the sewer now washes it 
 nevertheless do not trust yourself too much to it 
 miasmas still inhabit it it is more hypocritical than irreproachable 
 the prefecture of police and the commission of health have done their best but in spite of all the processes of disinfection it exhales a vague suspicious odor like tartuffe after confession 
 let us confess that taking it all in all this sweeping is a homage which the sewer pays to civilization and as from this point of view conscience is a progress over the augean stables it is certain that the sewers of paris have been improved 
 it is more than progress it is transmutation 
 between the ancient and the present sewer there is a revolution 
 what has effected this revolution 
 the man whom all the world forgets and whom we have mentioned bruneseau

 book fifteen 
 chapter xiii 
 
 in external ways pierre had hardly changed at all in appearance he was just what he used to be as before he was and seemed occupied not with what was before his eyes but with something special of his own the difference between his former and present self was that formerly when he did not grasp what lay before him or was said to him he had puckered his forehead painfully as if vainly seeking to distinguish something at a distance at present he still forgot what was said to him and still did not see what was before his eyes but he now looked with a scarcely perceptible and seemingly ironic smile at what was before him and listened to what was said though evidently seeing and hearing something quite different formerly he had appeared to be a kindhearted but unhappy man and so people had been inclined to avoid him now a smile at the joy of life always played round his lips and sympathy for others shone in his eyes with a questioning look as to whether they were as contented as he was and people felt pleased by his presence 
 previously he had talked a great deal grew excited when he talked and seldom listened now he was seldom carried away in conversation and knew how to listen so that people readily told him their most intimate secrets 
 the princess who had never liked pierre and had been particularly hostile to him since she had felt herself under obligations to him after the old death now after staying a short time in orel where she had come intending to show pierre that in spite of his ingratitude she considered it her duty to nurse him felt to her surprise and vexation that she had become fond of him pierre did not in any way seek her approval he merely studied her with interest formerly she had felt that he regarded her with indifference and irony and so had shrunk into herself as she did with others and had shown him only the combative side of her nature but now he seemed to be trying to understand the most intimate places of her heart and mistrustfully at first but afterwards gratefully she let him see the hidden kindly sides of her character 
 the most cunning man could not have crept into her confidence more successfully evoking memories of the best times of her youth and showing sympathy with them yet cunning consisted simply in finding pleasure in drawing out the human qualities of the embittered hard and in her own way proud princess 
 yes he is a very very kind man when he is not under the influence of bad people but of people such as myself thought she 
 his servants too terenty and vaska in their own way noticed the change that had taken place in pierre they considered that he had become much simpler terenty when he had helped him undress and wished him good night often lingered with his boots in his hands and clothes over his arm to see whether he would not start a talk and pierre noticing that terenty wanted a chat generally kept him there 
 well tell me now how did you get food he would ask 
 and terenty would begin talking of the destruction of moscow and of the old count and would stand for a long time holding the clothes and talking or sometimes listening to stories and then would go out into the hall with a pleasant sense of intimacy with his master and affection for him 
 the doctor who attended pierre and visited him every day though he considered it his duty as a doctor to pose as a man whose every moment was of value to suffering humanity would sit for hours with pierre telling him his favorite anecdotes and his observations on the characters of his patients in general and especially of the ladies 
 a pleasure to talk to a man like that he is not like our provincials he would say 
 there were several prisoners from the french army in orel and the doctor brought one of them a young italian to see pierre 
 this officer began visiting pierre and the princess used to make fun of the tenderness the italian expressed for him 
 the italian seemed happy only when he could come to see pierre talk with him tell him about his past his life at home and his love and pour out to him his indignation against the french and especially against napoleon 
 if all russians are in the least like you it is sacrilege to fight such a nation he said to pierre you who have suffered so from the french do not even feel animosity toward them 
 pierre had evoked the passionate affection of the italian merely by evoking the best side of his nature and taking a pleasure in so doing 
 during the last days of stay in orel his old masonic acquaintance count willarski who had introduced him to the lodge in came to see him willarski was married to a russian heiress who had a large estate in orel province and he occupied a temporary post in the commissariat department in that town 
 hearing that bezukhov was in orel willarski though they had never been intimate came to him with the professions of friendship and intimacy that people who meet in a desert generally express for one another willarski felt dull in orel and was pleased to meet a man of his own circle and as he supposed of similar interests 
 but to his surprise willarski soon noticed that pierre had lagged much behind the times and had sunk as he expressed it to himself into apathy and egotism 
 you are letting yourself go my dear fellow he said 
 but for all that willarski found it pleasanter now than it had been formerly to be with pierre and came to see him every day to pierre as he looked at and listened to willarski it seemed strange to think that he had been like that himself but a short time before 
 willarski was a married man with a family busy with his family affairs his affairs and his official duties he regarded all these occupations as hindrances to life and considered that they were all contemptible because their aim was the welfare of himself and his family military administrative political and masonic interests continually absorbed his attention and pierre without trying to change the views and without condemning him but with the quiet joyful and amused smile now habitual to him was interested in this strange though very familiar phenomenon 
 there was a new feature in relations with willarski with the princess with the doctor and with all the people he now met which gained for him the general good will this was his acknowledgment of the impossibility of changing a convictions by words and his recognition of the possibility of everyone thinking feeling and seeing things each from his own point of view this legitimate peculiarity of each individual which used to excite and irritate pierre now became a basis of the sympathy he felt for and the interest he took in other people the difference and sometimes complete contradiction between opinions and their lives and between one man and another pleased him and drew from him an amused and gentle smile 
 in practical matters pierre unexpectedly felt within himself a center of gravity he had previously lacked formerly all pecuniary questions especially requests for money to which as an extremely wealthy man he was very exposed produced in him a state of hopeless agitation and perplexity to give or not to give he had asked himself i have it and he needs it but someone else needs it still more who needs it most and perhaps they are both impostors in the old days he had been unable to find a way out of all these surmises and had given to all who asked as long as he had anything to give formerly he had been in a similar state of perplexity with regard to every question concerning his property when one person advised one thing and another something else 
 now to his surprise he found that he no longer felt either doubt or perplexity about these questions there was now within him a judge who by some rule unknown to him decided what should or should not be done 
 he was as indifferent as heretofore to money matters but now he felt certain of what ought and what ought not to be done the first time he had recourse to his new judge was when a french prisoner a colonel came to him and after talking a great deal about his exploits concluded by making what amounted to a demand that pierre should give him four thousand francs to send to his wife and children pierre refused without the least difficulty or effort and was afterwards surprised how simple and easy had been what used to appear so insurmountably difficult at the same time that he refused the demand he made up his mind that he must have recourse to artifice when leaving orel to induce the italian officer to accept some money of which he was evidently in need a further proof to pierre of his own more settled outlook on practical matters was furnished by his decision with regard to his debts and to the rebuilding of his houses in and near moscow 
 his head steward came to him at orel and pierre reckoned up with him his diminished income the burning of moscow had cost him according to the head calculation about two million rubles 
 to console pierre for these losses the head steward gave him an estimate showing that despite these losses his income would not be diminished but would even be increased if he refused to pay his debts which he was under no obligation to meet and did not rebuild his moscow house and the country house on his moscow estate which had cost him eighty thousand rubles a year and brought in nothing 
 yes of course true said pierre with a cheerful smile i need all that at all by being ruined i have become much richer 
 but in january savelich came from moscow and gave him an account of the state of things there and spoke of the estimate an architect had made of the cost of rebuilding the town and country houses speaking of this as of a settled matter about the same time he received letters from prince vasili and other petersburg acquaintances speaking of his debts and pierre decided that the proposals which had so pleased him were wrong and that he must go to petersburg and settle his affairs and must rebuild in moscow why this was necessary he did not know but he knew for certain that it was necessary his income would be reduced by three fourths but he felt it must be done 
 willarski was going to moscow and they agreed to travel together 
 during the whole time of his convalescence in orel pierre had experienced a feeling of joy freedom and life but when during his journey he found himself in the open world and saw hundreds of new faces that feeling was intensified throughout his journey he felt like a schoolboy on holiday everyone the stagecoach driver the overseers the peasants on the roads and in the villages had a new significance for him the presence and remarks of willarski who continually deplored the ignorance and poverty of russia and its backwardness compared with europe only heightened pleasure where willarski saw deadness pierre saw an extraordinary strength and vitality the strength which in that vast space amid the snows maintained the life of this original peculiar and unique people he did not contradict willarski and even seemed to agree with him an apparent agreement being the simplest way to avoid discussions that could lead to nothing and he smiled joyfully as he listened to him

 future progress 
 the excavation of the sewer of paris has been no slight task the last ten centuries have toiled at it without being able to bring it to a termination any more than they have been able to finish paris 
 the sewer in fact receives all the of the growth of paris 
 within the bosom of the earth it is a sort of mysterious polyp with a thousand antennae which expands below as the city expands above 
 every time that the city cuts a street the sewer stretches out an arm 
 the old monarchy had constructed only thousand three hundred metres of sewers that was where paris stood in this respect on the first of january beginning with this epoch of which we shall shortly speak the work was usefully and energetically resumed and prosecuted napoleon figures are thousand eight hundred and four metres louis xviii five thousand seven hundred and nine charles x ten thousand eight hundred and thousand and twenty the republic of thousand three hundred and the present government seventy thousand five hundred in all at the present time two hundred and thousand six hundred and ten metres sixty leagues of sewers the enormous entrails of paris 
 an obscure ramification ever at work a construction which is immense and ignored 
 as the reader sees the subterranean labyrinth of paris is more than ten times what it was at the beginning of the century it is difficult to form any idea of all the perseverance and the efforts which have been required to bring this to the point of relative perfection in which it now is 
 it was with great difficulty that the ancient monarchical provostship and during the last ten years of the eighteenth century the revolutionary mayoralty had succeeded in perforating the five leagues of sewer which existed previous to 
 all sorts of obstacles hindered this operation some peculiar to the soil others inherent in the very prejudices of the laborious population of paris 
 paris is built upon a soil which is singularly rebellious to the pick the hoe the bore and to human manipulation 
 there is nothing more difficult to pierce and to penetrate than the geological formation upon which is superposed the marvellous historical formation called paris as soon as work in any form whatsoever is begun and adventures upon this stretch of alluvium subterranean resistances abound there are liquid clays springs hard rocks and those soft and deep quagmires which special science calls moutardes the pick advances laboriously through the calcareous layers alternating with very slender threads of clay and schistose beds in plates incrusted with the contemporaries of the oceans 
 sometimes a rivulet suddenly bursts through a vault that has been begun and inundates the laborers or a layer of marl is laid bare and rolls down with the fury of a cataract breaking the stoutest supporting beams like glass 
 quite recently at villette when it became necessary to pass the collecting sewer under the canal without interrupting navigation or emptying the canal a fissure appeared in the basin of the canal water suddenly became abundant in the subterranean tunnel which was beyond the power of the pumping engines it was necessary to send a diver to explore the fissure which had been made in the narrow entrance of the grand basin and it was not without great difficulty that it was stopped up 
 elsewhere near the seine and even at a considerable distance from the river as for instance at belleville and lumiere passage quicksands are encountered in which one sticks fast and in which a man sinks visibly 
 add suffocation by miasmas burial by slides and sudden crumbling of the earth add the typhus with which the workmen become slowly impregnated in our own day after having excavated the gallery of clichy with a banquette to receive the principal of ourcq a piece of work which was executed in a trench ten metres deep after having in the midst of and with the aid of excavations often putrid and of shoring up vaulted the bievre from the boulevard de as far as the seine after having in order to deliver paris from the floods of montmartre and in order to provide an outlet for that pool nine hectares in extent which crouched near the barriere des martyrs after having let us state constructed the line of sewers from the barriere blanche to the road of aubervilliers in four months working day and night at a depth of eleven metres after thing heretofore unseen made a subterranean sewer in the rue without a trench six metres below the surface the superintendent monnot died after having vaulted three thousand metres of sewer in all quarters of the city from the rue to the rue de after having freed the carrefour from inundations of rain by means of the branch of the arbalete after having built the sewer on rock and concrete in the fluid sands after having directed the formidable lowering of the flooring of the vault timber in the branch duleau the engineer died 
 there are no bulletins for such acts of bravery as these which are more useful nevertheless than the brutal slaughter of the field of battle 
 mustards 
 the sewers of paris in were far from being what they are bruneseau had given the impulse but the cholera was required to bring about the vast reconstruction which took place later on 
 it is surprising to say for example that in a part of the belt sewer called the grand canal as in venice still stood stagnating uncovered to the sky in the rue des gourdes it was only in that the city of paris found in its pocket the two hundred and eighty francs and six centimes required for covering this mass of filth 
 the three absorbing wells of the combat the cunette and with their discharging mouths their apparatus their cesspools and their depuratory branches only date from 
 the intestinal sewer of paris has been made over anew and as we have said it has been extended more than tenfold within the last quarter of a century 
 thirty years ago at the epoch of the insurrection of the th and th of june it was still in many localities nearly the same ancient sewer a very great number of streets which are now convex were then sunken causeways 
 at the end of a slope where the tributaries of a street or ended there were often to be seen large square gratings with heavy bars whose iron polished by the footsteps of the throng gleamed dangerous and slippery for vehicles and caused horses to fall 
 the official language of the roads and bridges gave to these gratings the expressive name of cassis 
 from casser to break 
 
 in in a number of streets in the rue de the rue the rue du temple the rue the rue de nazareth the rue the quai aux fleurs the rue du the rue du normandie the rue the rue des marais the faubourg the rue notre dame the faubourg montmartre the rue in the the rue jacob the rue de tournon the ancient gothic sewer still cynically displayed its maw it consisted of enormous voids of stone sometimes surrounded by stone posts with monumental effrontery 
 paris in still had nearly the same sewers numerically as stated in five thousand three hundred fathoms 
 after bruneseau on the st of january it had forty thousand three hundred metres between and there had been built on an average seven hundred and fifty metres annually afterwards eight and even ten thousand metres of galleries were constructed every year in masonry of small stones with hydraulic mortar which hardens under water on a cement foundation 
 at two hundred francs the metre the sixty leagues of paris sewers of the present day represent millions 
 in addition to the economic progress which we have indicated at the beginning grave problems of public hygiene are connected with that immense question 
 the sewers of paris 
 paris is the centre of two sheets a sheet of water and a sheet of air the sheet of water lying at a tolerably great depth underground but already sounded by two bores is furnished by the layer of green clay situated between the chalk and the jurassic this layer may be represented by a disk five and twenty leagues in circumference a multitude of rivers and brooks ooze there one drinks the seine the marne the yonne the oise the aisne the cher the vienne and the loire in a glass of water from the well of grenelle the sheet of water is healthy it comes from heaven in the first place and next from the earth the sheet of air is unhealthy it comes from the sewer 
 all the miasms of the are mingled with the breath of the city hence this bad breath 
 the air taken from above a as has been scientifically proved is purer than the air taken from above paris 
 in a given time with the aid of progress mechanisms become perfected and as light increases the sheet of water will be employed to purify the sheet of air that is to say to wash the sewer 
 the reader knows that by washing the sewer we mean 
 the restitution of the filth to the earth the return to the soil of dung and of manure to the fields through this simple act the entire social community will experience a diminution of misery and an augmentation of health at the present hour the radiation of diseases from paris extends to fifty leagues around the louvre taken as the hub of this pestilential wheel 
 we might say that for ten centuries the has been the disease of paris 
 the sewer is the blemish which paris has in her blood the popular instinct has never been deceived in it 
 the occupation of sewermen was formerly almost as perilous and almost as repugnant to the people as the occupation of knacker which was so long held in horror and handed over to the executioner 
 high wages were necessary to induce a mason to disappear in that fetid mine the ladder of the cleaner hesitated to plunge into it it was said in proverbial form 
 to descend into the sewer is to enter the grave and all sorts of hideous legends as we have said covered this colossal sink with terror a dread which bears the traces of the revolutions of the globe as of the revolutions of man and where are to be found vestiges of all cataclysms from the shells of the deluge to the rag of marat

 it would be difficult to explain why and whither ants whose heap has been destroyed are hurrying some from the heap dragging bits of rubbish larvae and corpses others back to the heap or why they jostle overtake one another and fight and it would be equally difficult to explain what caused the russians after the departure of the french to throng to the place that had formerly been moscow but when we watch the ants round their ruined heap the tenacity energy and immense number of the delving insects prove that despite the destruction of the heap something indestructible which though intangible is the real strength of the colony still exists and similarly though in moscow in the month of october there was no government no churches shrines riches or houses it was still the moscow it had been in august all was destroyed except something intangible yet powerful and indestructible 
 the motives of those who thronged from all sides to moscow after it had been cleared of the enemy were most diverse and personal and at first for the most part savage and brutal one motive only they all had in common a desire to get to the place that had been called moscow to apply their activities there 
 within a week moscow already had fifteen thousand inhabitants in a fortnight thousand and so on by the autumn of the number ever increasing and increasing exceeded what it had been in 
 the first russians to enter moscow were the cossacks of detachment peasants from the adjacent villages and residents who had fled from moscow and had been hiding in its vicinity the russians who entered moscow finding it plundered plundered it in their turn they continued what the french had begun trains of peasant carts came to moscow to carry off to the villages what had been abandoned in the ruined houses and the streets the cossacks carried off what they could to their camps and the householders seized all they could find in other houses and moved it to their own pretending that it was their property 
 but the first plunderers were followed by a second and a third contingent and with increasing numbers plundering became more and more difficult and assumed more definite forms 
 the french found moscow abandoned but with all the organizations of regular life with diverse branches of commerce and craftsmanship with luxury and governmental and religious institutions these forms were lifeless but still existed there were bazaars shops warehouses market stalls granaries for the most part still stocked with goods and there were factories and workshops palaces and wealthy houses filled with luxuries hospitals prisons government offices churches and cathedrals the longer the french remained the more these forms of town life perished until finally all was merged into one confused lifeless scene of plunder 
 the more the plundering by the french continued the more both the wealth of moscow and the strength of its plunderers was destroyed but plundering by the russians with which the reoccupation of the city began had an opposite effect the longer it continued and the greater the number of people taking part in it the more rapidly was the wealth of the city and its regular life restored 
 besides the plunderers very various people some drawn by curiosity some by official duties some by house owners clergy officials of all kinds tradesmen artisans and peasants streamed into moscow as blood flows to the heart 
 within a week the peasants who came with empty carts to carry off plunder were stopped by the authorities and made to cart the corpses out of the town other peasants having heard of their comrades discomfiture came to town bringing rye oats and hay and beat down one prices to below what they had been in former days gangs of carpenters hoping for high pay arrived in moscow every day and on all sides logs were being hewn new houses built and old charred ones repaired tradesmen began trading in booths cookshops and taverns were opened in partially burned houses the clergy resumed the services in many churches that had not been burned donors contributed church property that had been stolen government clerks set up their tables and their pigeonholes of documents in small rooms the higher authorities and the police organized the distribution of goods left behind by the french the owners of houses in which much property had been left brought there from other houses complained of the injustice of taking everything to the faceted palace in the kremlin others insisted that as the french had gathered things from different houses into this or that house it would be unfair to allow its owner to keep all that was found there they abused the police and bribed them made out estimates at ten times their value for government stores that had perished in the fire and demanded relief and count rostopchin wrote proclamations

 the sewer and its surprises 
 it was in the sewers of paris that jean valjean found himself 
 still another resemblance between paris and the sea 
 as in the ocean the diver may disappear there 
 the transition was an one 
 in the very heart of the city jean valjean had escaped from the city and in the twinkling of an eye in the time required to lift the cover and to replace it he had passed from broad daylight to complete obscurity from midday to midnight from tumult to silence from the whirlwind of thunders to the stagnation of the tomb and by a vicissitude far more tremendous even than that of the rue polonceau from the most extreme peril to the most absolute obscurity 
 an abrupt fall into a cavern a disappearance into the secret of paris to quit that street where death was on every side for that sort of sepulchre where there was life was a strange instant 
 he remained for several seconds as though bewildered listening stupefied 
 the of safety had suddenly yawned beneath him 
 celestial goodness had in a manner captured him by treachery 
 adorable ambuscades of providence 
 only the wounded man did not stir and jean valjean did not know whether that which he was carrying in that grave was a living being or a dead corpse 
 his first sensation was one of blindness 
 all of a sudden he could see nothing 
 it seemed to him too that in one instant he had become deaf 
 he no longer heard anything 
 the frantic storm of murder which had been let loose a few feet above his head did not reach him thanks to the thickness of the earth which separated him from it as we have said otherwise than faintly and indistinctly and like a rumbling in the depths he felt that the ground was solid under his feet that was all but that was enough 
 he extended one arm and then the other touched the walls on both sides and perceived that the passage was narrow he slipped and thus perceived that the pavement was wet he cautiously put forward one foot fearing a hole a sink some gulf he discovered that the paving continued 
 a gust of fetidness informed him of the place in which he stood 
 after the lapse of a few minutes he was no longer blind 
 a little light fell through the through which he had descended and his eyes became accustomed to this cavern 
 he began to distinguish something the passage in which he had other word can better express the walled in behind him 
 it was one of those blind alleys which the special jargon terms branches in front of him there was another wall a wall like night the light of the died out ten or twelve paces from the point where jean valjean stood and barely cast a wan pallor on a few metres of the damp walls of the sewer 
 beyond the opaqueness was massive to penetrate thither seemed horrible an entrance into it appeared like an engulfment 
 a man could however plunge into that wall of fog and it was necessary so to do 
 haste was even requisite it occurred to jean valjean that the grating which he had caught sight of under the might also catch the eye of the soldiery and that everything hung upon this chance 
 they also might descend into that well and search it 
 there was not a minute to be lost he had deposited marius on the ground he picked him up again that is the real word for him on his shoulders once more and set out 
 he plunged resolutely into the gloom 
 the truth is that they were less safe than jean valjean fancied perils of another sort and no less serious were awaiting them perchance 
 after the whirlwind of the combat the cavern of miasmas and traps after chaos the sewer jean valjean had fallen from one circle of hell into another 
 when he had advanced fifty paces he was obliged to halt 
 a problem presented itself 
 the passage terminated in another gut which he encountered across his path 
 there two ways presented themselves which should he take 
 ought he to turn to the left or to the right how was he to find his bearings in that black labyrinth this labyrinth to which we have already called the attention has a clue which is its slope 
 to follow to the slope is to arrive at the river 
 this jean valjean instantly comprehended 
 he said to himself that he was probably in the sewer des halles that if he were to choose the path to the left and follow the slope he would arrive in less than a quarter of an hour at some mouth on the seine between the pont au change and the that is to say he would make his appearance in broad daylight on the most densely peopled spot in paris 
 perhaps he would come out on some at the intersection of streets 
 amazement of the at beholding two bleeding men emerge from the earth at their feet arrival of the police a call to arms of the neighboring post of guards 
 thus they would be seized before they had even got out it would be better to plunge into that labyrinth to confide themselves to that black gloom and to trust to providence for the outcome 
 he ascended the incline and turned to the right 
 when he had turned the angle of the gallery the distant glimmer of an disappeared the curtain of obscurity fell upon him once more and he became blind again 
 nevertheless he advanced as rapidly as possible 
 marius two arms were passed round his neck and the feet dragged behind him 
 he held both these arms with one hand and groped along the wall with the other 
 marius cheek touched his and clung there bleeding he felt a warm stream which came from marius trickling down upon him and making its way under his clothes 
 but a humid warmth near his ear which the mouth of the wounded man touched indicated respiration and consequently life 
 the passage along which jean valjean was now proceeding was not so narrow as the first jean valjean walked through it with considerable difficulty the rain of the preceding day had not as yet entirely run off and it created a little torrent in the centre of the bottom and he was forced to hug the wall in order not to have his feet in the water 
 thus he proceeded in the gloom 
 he resembled the beings of the night groping in the invisible and lost beneath the earth in veins of shadow 
 still little by little whether it was that the distant emitted a little wavering light in this opaque gloom or whether his eyes had become accustomed to the obscurity some vague vision returned to him and he began once more to gain a confused idea now of the wall which he touched now of the vault beneath which he was passing 
 the pupil dilates in the dark and the soul dilates in misfortune and ends by finding god there 
 it was not easy to direct his course 
 the line of the sewer so to speak the line of the streets which lie above it 
 there were then in paris two thousand two hundred streets 
 let the reader imagine himself beneath that forest of gloomy branches which is called the sewer the system of sewers existing at that epoch placed end to end would have given a length of eleven leagues 
 we have said above that the actual thanks to the special activity of the last thirty years was no less than sixty leagues in extent 
 jean valjean began by committing a blunder 
 he thought that he was beneath the rue and it was a pity that it was not so under the rue there is an old stone sewer which dates from louis xiii 
 and which runs straight to the collecting sewer called the grand sewer with but a single elbow on the right on the elevation of the ancient cour des miracles and a single branch the sewer whose four arms describe a cross 
 but the gut of the the entrance to which was in the vicinity of the corinthe has never communicated with the sewer of the rue it ended at the montmartre sewer and it was in this that jean valjean was entangled 
 there opportunities of losing oneself abound 
 the montmartre sewer is one of the most labyrinthine of the ancient network 
 fortunately jean valjean had left behind him the sewer of the markets whose geometrical plan presents the appearance of a multitude of parrots roosts piled on top of each other but he had before him more than one embarrassing encounter and more than one street they are streets presenting itself in the gloom like an interrogation point first on his left the vast sewer of the platriere a sort of chinese puzzle thrusting out and entangling its chaos of ts and zs under the and under the rotunda of the wheat market as far as the seine where it terminates in a y secondly on his right the curving corridor of the rue du cadran with its three teeth which are also blind courts thirdly on his left the branch of the mail complicated almost at its inception with a sort of fork and proceeding from to until it ends in the grand crypt of the outlet of the louvre truncated and ramified in every direction and lastly the blind alley of a passage of the rue des jeuneurs without counting little ducts here and there before reaching the belt sewer which alone could conduct him to some issue sufficiently distant to be safe 
 had jean valjean had any idea of all that we have here pointed out he would speedily have perceived merely by feeling the wall that he was not in the subterranean gallery of the rue instead of the ancient stone instead of the antique architecture haughty and royal even in the sewer with pavement and string courses of granite and mortar costing eight hundred livres the fathom he would have felt under his hand contemporary cheapness economical expedients porous stone filled with mortar on a concrete foundation which costs two hundred francs the metre and the bourgeoise masonry known as a petits stuff but of all this he knew nothing 
 he advanced with anxiety but with calmness seeing nothing knowing nothing buried in chance that is to say engulfed in providence 
 by degrees we will admit a certain horror seized upon him the gloom which enveloped him penetrated his spirit 
 he walked in an enigma 
 this aqueduct of the sewer is formidable it interlaces in a dizzy fashion 
 it is a melancholy thing to be caught in this paris of shadows 
 jean valjean was obliged to find and even to invent his route without seeing it 
 in this unknown every step that he risked might be his last 
 how was he to get out should he find an issue should he find it in time would that colossal subterranean sponge with its stone cavities allow itself to be penetrated and pierced should he there encounter some unexpected knot in the darkness should he arrive at the inextricable and the impassable would marius die there of hemorrhage and he of hunger should they end by both getting lost and by furnishing two skeletons in a nook of that night 
 he did not know he put all these questions to himself without replying to them the intestines of paris form a precipice 
 like the prophet he was in the belly of the monster 
 all at once he had a surprise 
 at the most unforeseen moment and without having ceased to walk in a straight line he perceived that he was no longer ascending the water of the rivulet was beating against his heels instead of meeting him at his toes the sewer was now descending 
 why 
 was he about to arrive suddenly at the seine 
 this danger was a great one but the peril of retreating was still greater 
 he continued to advance 
 it was not towards the seine that he was proceeding 
 the ridge which the soil of paris forms on its right bank empties one of its into the seine and the other into the grand sewer the crest of this ridge which determines the division of the waters describes a very capricious line 
 the culminating point which is the point of separation of the currents is in the sewer beyond the rue in the sewer of the louvre near the boulevards and in the montmartre sewer near the halles it was this culminating point that jean valjean had reached 
 he was directing his course towards the belt sewer he was on the right path but he did not know it 
 every time that he encountered a branch he felt of its angles and if he found that the opening which presented itself was smaller than the passage in which he was he did not enter but continued his route rightly judging that every narrower way must needs terminate in a blind alley and could only lead him further from his goal that is to say the outlet 
 thus he avoided the quadruple trap which was set for him in the darkness by the four labyrinths which we have just enumerated 
 at a certain moment he perceived that he was emerging from beneath the paris which was petrified by the uprising where the barricades had suppressed circulation and that he was entering beneath the living and normal paris 
 overhead he suddenly heard a noise as of thunder distant but continuous 
 it was the rumbling of vehicles 
 he had been walking for about half an hour at least according to the calculation which he made in his own mind and he had not yet thought of rest he had merely changed the hand with which he was holding marius 
 the darkness was more profound than ever but its very depth reassured him 
 all at once he saw his shadow in front of him 
 it was outlined on a faint almost indistinct reddish glow which vaguely empurpled the flooring vault underfoot and the vault overhead and gilded to his right and to his left the two viscous walls of the passage stupefied he turned round 
 behind him in the portion of the passage which he had just passed through at a distance which appeared to him immense piercing the dense obscurity flamed a sort of horrible star which had the air of surveying him 
 it was the gloomy star of the police which was rising in the sewer 
 in the rear of that star eight or ten forms were moving about in a confused way black upright indistinct horrible 
 the sewer and its surprises

 he said to himself that he was probably in the sewer des halles that if he were to choose the path to the left and follow the slope he would arrive in less than a quarter of an hour at some mouth on the seine between the pont au change and the that is to say he would make his appearance in broad daylight on the most densely peopled spot in paris 
 perhaps he would come out on some at the intersection of streets 
 amazement of the at beholding two bleeding men emerge from the earth at their feet arrival of the police a call to arms of the neighboring post of guards 
 thus they would be seized before they had even got out it would be better to plunge into that labyrinth to confide themselves to that black gloom and to trust to providence for the outcome 
 he ascended the incline and turned to the right 
 when he had turned the angle of the gallery the distant glimmer of an disappeared the curtain of obscurity fell upon him once more and he became blind again 
 nevertheless he advanced as rapidly as possible 
 marius two arms were passed round his neck and the feet dragged behind him 
 he held both these arms with one hand and groped along the wall with the other 
 marius cheek touched his and clung there bleeding he felt a warm stream which came from marius trickling down upon him and making its way under his clothes 
 but a humid warmth near his ear which the mouth of the wounded man touched indicated respiration and consequently life 
 the passage along which jean valjean was now proceeding was not so narrow as the first jean valjean walked through it with considerable difficulty the rain of the preceding day had not as yet entirely run off and it created a little torrent in the centre of the bottom and he was forced to hug the wall in order not to have his feet in the water 
 thus he proceeded in the gloom 
 he resembled the beings of the night groping in the invisible and lost beneath the earth in veins of shadow 
 still little by little whether it was that the distant emitted a little wavering light in this opaque gloom or whether his eyes had become accustomed to the obscurity some vague vision returned to him and he began once more to gain a confused idea now of the wall which he touched now of the vault beneath which he was passing 
 the pupil dilates in the dark and the soul dilates in misfortune and ends by finding god there 
 it was not easy to direct his course 
 the line of the sewer so to speak the line of the streets which lie above it 
 there were then in paris two thousand two hundred streets 
 let the reader imagine himself beneath that forest of gloomy branches which is called the sewer the system of sewers existing at that epoch placed end to end would have given a length of eleven leagues 
 we have said above that the actual thanks to the special activity of the last thirty years was no less than sixty leagues in extent 
 jean valjean began by committing a blunder 
 he thought that he was beneath the rue and it was a pity that it was not so under the rue there is an old stone sewer which dates from louis xiii 
 and which runs straight to the collecting sewer called the grand sewer with but a single elbow on the right on the elevation of the ancient cour des miracles and a single branch the sewer whose four arms describe a cross 
 but the gut of the the entrance to which was in the vicinity of the corinthe has never communicated with the sewer of the rue it ended at the montmartre sewer and it was in this that jean valjean was entangled 
 there opportunities of losing oneself abound 
 the montmartre sewer is one of the most labyrinthine of the ancient network 
 fortunately jean valjean had left behind him the sewer of the markets whose geometrical plan presents the appearance of a multitude of parrots roosts piled on top of each other but he had before him more than one embarrassing encounter and more than one street they are streets presenting itself in the gloom like an interrogation point first on his left the vast sewer of the platriere a sort of chinese puzzle thrusting out and entangling its chaos of ts and zs under the and under the rotunda of the wheat market as far as the seine where it terminates in a y secondly on his right the curving corridor of the rue du cadran with its three teeth which are also blind courts thirdly on his left the branch of the mail complicated almost at its inception with a sort of fork and proceeding from to until it ends in the grand crypt of the outlet of the louvre truncated and ramified in every direction and lastly the blind alley of a passage of the rue des jeuneurs without counting little ducts here and there before reaching the belt sewer which alone could conduct him to some issue sufficiently distant to be safe 
 had jean valjean had any idea of all that we have here pointed out he would speedily have perceived merely by feeling the wall that he was not in the subterranean gallery of the rue instead of the ancient stone instead of the antique architecture haughty and royal even in the sewer with pavement and string courses of granite and mortar costing eight hundred livres the fathom he would have felt under his hand contemporary cheapness economical expedients porous stone filled with mortar on a concrete foundation which costs two hundred francs the metre and the bourgeoise masonry known as a petits stuff but of all this he knew nothing 
 he advanced with anxiety but with calmness seeing nothing knowing nothing buried in chance that is to say engulfed in providence 
 by degrees we will admit a certain horror seized upon him the gloom which enveloped him penetrated his spirit 
 he walked in an enigma 
 this aqueduct of the sewer is formidable it interlaces in a dizzy fashion 
 it is a melancholy thing to be caught in this paris of shadows 
 jean valjean was obliged to find and even to invent his route without seeing it 
 in this unknown every step that he risked might be his last 
 how was he to get out should he find an issue should he find it in time would that colossal subterranean sponge with its stone cavities allow itself to be penetrated and pierced should he there encounter some unexpected knot in the darkness should he arrive at the inextricable and the impassable would marius die there of hemorrhage and he of hunger should they end by both getting lost and by furnishing two skeletons in a nook of that night 
 he did not know he put all these questions to himself without replying to them the intestines of paris form a precipice 
 like the prophet he was in the belly of the monster 
 all at once he had a surprise 
 at the most unforeseen moment and without having ceased to walk in a straight line he perceived that he was no longer ascending the water of the rivulet was beating against his heels instead of meeting him at his toes the sewer was now descending 
 why 
 was he about to arrive suddenly at the seine 
 this danger was a great one but the peril of retreating was still greater 
 he continued to advance 
 it was not towards the seine that he was proceeding 
 the ridge which the soil of paris forms on its right bank empties one of its into the seine and the other into the grand sewer the crest of this ridge which determines the division of the waters describes a very capricious line 
 the culminating point which is the point of separation of the currents is in the sewer beyond the rue in the sewer of the louvre near the boulevards and in the montmartre sewer near the halles it was this culminating point that jean valjean had reached 
 he was directing his course towards the belt sewer he was on the right path but he did not know it 
 every time that he encountered a branch he felt of its angles and if he found that the opening which presented itself was smaller than the passage in which he was he did not enter but continued his route rightly judging that every narrower way must needs terminate in a blind alley and could only lead him further from his goal that is to say the outlet 
 thus he avoided the quadruple trap which was set for him in the darkness by the four labyrinths which we have just enumerated 
 at a certain moment he perceived that he was emerging from beneath the paris which was petrified by the uprising where the barricades had suppressed circulation and that he was entering beneath the living and normal paris 
 overhead he suddenly heard a noise as of thunder distant but continuous 
 it was the rumbling of vehicles 
 he had been walking for about half an hour at least according to the calculation which he made in his own mind and he had not yet thought of rest he had merely changed the hand with which he was holding marius 
 the darkness was more profound than ever but its very depth reassured him 
 all at once he saw his shadow in front of him 
 it was outlined on a faint almost indistinct reddish glow which vaguely empurpled the flooring vault underfoot and the vault overhead and gilded to his right and to his left the two viscous walls of the passage stupefied he turned round 
 behind him in the portion of the passage which he had just passed through at a distance which appeared to him immense piercing the dense obscurity flamed a sort of horrible star which had the air of surveying him 
 it was the gloomy star of the police which was rising in the sewer 
 in the rear of that star eight or ten forms were moving about in a confused way black upright indistinct horrible

 chapter xv 
 
 at the end of january pierre went to moscow and stayed in an annex of his house which had not been burned he called on count rostopchin and on some acquaintances who were back in moscow and he intended to leave for petersburg two days later everybody was celebrating the victory everything was bubbling with life in the ruined but reviving city everyone was pleased to see pierre everyone wished to meet him and everyone questioned him about what he had seen pierre felt particularly well disposed toward them all but was now instinctively on his guard for fear of binding himself in any way to all questions put to him whether important or quite trifling such as where would he live was he going to rebuild when was he going to petersburg and would he mind taking a parcel for someone he replied yes perhaps or i think so and so on 
 he had heard that the rostovs were at kostroma but the thought of natasha seldom occurred to him if it did it was only as a pleasant memory of the distant past he felt himself not only free from social obligations but also from that feeling which it seemed to him he had aroused in himself 
 on the third day after his arrival he heard from the drubetskoys that princess mary was in moscow the death sufferings and last days of prince andrew had often occupied thoughts and now recurred to him with fresh vividness having heard at dinner that princess mary was in moscow and living in her house which had not been burned in vozdvizhenka street he drove that same evening to see her 
 on his way to the house pierre kept thinking of prince andrew of their friendship of his various meetings with him and especially of the last one at borodino 
 is it possible that he died in the bitter frame of mind he was then in is it possible that the meaning of life was not disclosed to him before he died thought pierre he recalled karataev and his death and involuntarily began to compare these two men so different and yet so similar in that they had both lived and both died and in the love he felt for both of them 
 pierre drove up to the house of the old prince in a most serious mood the house had escaped the fire it showed signs of damage but its general aspect was unchanged the old footman who met pierre with a stern face as if wishing to make the visitor feel that the absence of the old prince had not disturbed the order of things in the house informed him that the princess had gone to her own apartments and that she received on sundays 
 announce me perhaps she will see me said pierre 
 yes sir said the man please step into the portrait gallery 
 a few minutes later the footman returned with dessalles who brought word from the princess that she would be very glad to see pierre if he would excuse her want of ceremony and come upstairs to her apartment 
 in a rather low room lit by one candle sat the princess and with her another person dressed in black pierre remembered that the princess always had lady companions but who they were and what they were like he never knew or remembered this must be one of her companions he thought glancing at the lady in the black dress 
 the princess rose quickly to meet him and held out her hand 
 yes she said looking at his altered face after he had kissed her hand so this is how we meet again he of spoke of you even at the very last she went on turning her eyes from pierre to her companion with a shyness that surprised him for an instant 
 i was so glad to hear of your safety it was the first piece of good news we had received for a long time 
 again the princess glanced round at her companion with even more uneasiness in her manner and was about to add something but pierre interrupted her 
 just imagine i knew nothing about him said he i thought he had been killed all i know i heard at second hand from others i only know that he fell in with the rostovs what a strange coincidence 
 pierre spoke rapidly and with animation he glanced once at the face saw her attentive and kindly gaze fixed on him and as often happens when one is talking felt somehow that this companion in the black dress was a good kind excellent creature who would not hinder his conversing freely with princess mary 
 but when he mentioned the rostovs princess face expressed still greater embarrassment she again glanced rapidly from face to that of the lady in the black dress and said 
 do you really not recognize her 
 pierre looked again at the pale delicate face with its black eyes and peculiar mouth and something near to him long forgotten and more than sweet looked at him from those attentive eyes 
 but no it be he thought this stern thin pale face that looks so much older it cannot be she it merely reminds me of her but at that moment princess mary said natasha and with difficulty effort and stress like the opening of a door grown rusty on its hinges a smile appeared on the face with the attentive eyes and from that opening door came a breath of fragrance which suffused pierre with a happiness he had long forgotten and of which he had not even been thinking especially at that moment it suffused him seized him and enveloped him completely when she smiled doubt was no longer possible it was natasha and he loved her 
 at that moment pierre involuntarily betrayed to her to princess mary and above all to himself a secret of which he himself had been unaware he flushed joyfully yet with painful distress he tried to hide his agitation but the more he tried to hide it the more clearly clearer than any words could have done did he betray to himself to her and to princess mary that he loved her 
 no only the unexpectedness of it thought pierre but as soon as he tried to continue the conversation he had begun with princess mary he again glanced at natasha and a flush suffused his face and a agitation of mingled joy and fear seized his soul he became confused in his speech and stopped in the middle of what he was saying 
 pierre had failed to notice natasha because he did not at all expect to see her there but he had failed to recognize her because the change in her since he last saw her was immense she had grown thin and pale but that was not what made her unrecognizable she was unrecognizable at the moment he entered because on that face whose eyes had always shone with a suppressed smile of the joy of life now when he first entered and glanced at her there was not the least shadow of a smile only her eyes were kindly attentive and sadly interrogative 
 confusion was not reflected by any confusion on part but only by the pleasure that just perceptibly lit up her whole face

 book but the soul 
 chapter ii 
 
 explanation 
 on the day of the sixth of june a battue of the sewers had been ordered it was feared that the vanquished might have taken to them for refuge and prefect gisquet was to search occult paris while general bugeaud swept public paris a double and connected operation which exacted a double strategy on the part of the public force represented above by the army and below by the police 
 three squads of agents and sewermen explored the subterranean drain of paris the first on the right bank the second on the left bank the third in the city 
 the agents of police were armed with carabines with bludgeons swords and poignards 
 that which was directed at jean valjean at that moment was the lantern of the patrol of the right bank 
 this patrol had just visited the curving gallery and the three blind alleys which lie beneath the rue du cadran 
 while they were passing their lantern through the depths of these blind alleys jean valjean had encountered on his path the entrance to the gallery had perceived that it was narrower than the principal passage and had not penetrated thither 
 he had passed on 
 the police on emerging from the gallery du cadran had fancied that they heard the sound of footsteps in the direction of the belt sewer they were in fact the steps of jean valjean 
 the sergeant in command of the patrol had raised his lantern and the squad had begun to gaze into the mist in the direction whence the sound proceeded 
 this was an indescribable moment for jean valjean 
 happily if he saw the lantern well the lantern saw him but ill it was light and he was shadow 
 he was very far off and mingled with the darkness of the place 
 he hugged the wall and halted moreover he did not understand what it was that was moving behind him the lack of sleep and food and his emotions had caused him also to pass into the state of a visionary 
 he beheld a gleam and around that gleam forms 
 what was it 
 he did not comprehend 
 jean valjean having paused the sound ceased 
 the men of the patrol listened and heard nothing they looked and saw nothing 
 they held a consultation 
 there existed at that epoch at this point of the montmartre sewer a sort of called de service which was afterwards suppressed on account of the little interior lake which formed there swallowing up the torrent of rain in heavy storms the patrol could form a cluster in this open space 
 jean valjean saw these spectres form a sort of circle 
 these heads approached each other closely and whispered together 
 the result of this council held by the watch dogs was that they had been mistaken that there had been no noise that it was useless to get entangled in the belt sewer that it would only be a waste of time but that they ought to hasten towards that if there was anything to do and any bousingot to track out it was in that quarter 
 from time to time parties their old insults 
 in the word bousingot formed the interim between the word jacobin which had become obsolete and the word demagogue which has since rendered such excellent service 
 the sergeant gave orders to turn to the left towards the watershed of the seine 
 if it had occurred to them to separate into two squads and to go in both directions jean valjean would have been captured all hung on that thread 
 it is probable that the instructions of the prefecture foreseeing a possibility of combat and insurgents in force had forbidden the patrol to part company the patrol resumed its march leaving jean valjean behind it of all this movement jean valjean perceived nothing except the eclipse of the lantern which suddenly wheeled round 
 before taking his departure the sergeant in order to acquit his conscience discharged his gun in the direction of jean valjean 
 the detonation rolled from echo to echo in the crypt like the rumbling of that titanic entrail 
 a bit of plaster which fell into the stream and splashed up the water a few paces away from jean valjean warned him that the ball had struck the arch over his head 
 slow and measured steps resounded for some time on the timber work gradually dying away as they retreated to a greater distance the group of black forms vanished a glimmer of light oscillated and floated communicating to the vault a reddish glow which grew fainter then disappeared the silence became profound once more the obscurity became complete blindness and deafness resumed possession of the shadows and jean valjean not daring to stir as yet remained for a long time leaning with his back against the wall with straining ears and dilated pupils watching the disappearance of that phantom patrol

 she has come to stay with me said princess mary the count and countess will be here in a few days the countess is in a dreadful state but it was necessary for natasha herself to see a doctor they insisted on her coming with me 
 yes is there a family free from sorrow now said pierre addressing natasha you know it happened the very day we were rescued i saw him what a delightful boy he was 
 natasha looked at him and by way of answer to his words her eyes widened and lit up 
 what can one say or think of as a consolation said pierre nothing why had such a splendid boy so full of life to die 
 yes in these days it would be hard to live without faith remarked princess mary 
 yes yes that is really true pierre hastily interrupted her 
 why is it true natasha asked looking attentively into eyes 
 how can you ask why said princess mary the thought alone of what awaits 
 natasha without waiting for princess mary to finish again looked inquiringly at pierre 
 and because pierre continued only one who believes that there is a god ruling us can bear a loss such as hers and yours 
 natasha had already opened her mouth to speak but suddenly stopped pierre hurriedly turned away from her and again addressed princess mary asking about his last days 
 confusion had now almost vanished but at the same time he felt that his freedom had also completely gone he felt that there was now a judge of his every word and action whose judgment mattered more to him than that of all the rest of the world as he spoke now he was considering what impression his words would make on natasha he did not purposely say things to please her but whatever he was saying he regarded from her standpoint 
 princess mary reluctantly as is usual in such cases began telling of the condition in which she had found prince andrew but face quivering with emotion his questions and his eager restless expression gradually compelled her to go into details which she feared to recall for her own sake 
 yes yes and so pierre kept saying as he leaned toward her with his whole body and eagerly listened to her story yes yes so he grew tranquil and softened with all his soul he had always sought one thing to be perfectly good so he could not be afraid of death the faults he had if he had any were not of his making so he did soften what a happy thing that he saw you again he added suddenly turning to natasha and looking at her with eyes full of tears 
 face twitched she frowned and lowered her eyes for a moment she hesitated for an instant whether to speak or not 
 yes that was happiness she then said in her quiet voice with its deep chest notes for me it certainly was happiness she paused and he he he said he was wishing for it at the very moment i entered the room 
 voice broke she blushed pressed her clasped hands on her knees and then controlling herself with an evident effort lifted her head and began to speak rapidly 
 we knew nothing of it when we started from moscow i did not dare to ask about him then suddenly sonya told me he was traveling with us i had no idea and could not imagine what state he was in all i wanted was to see him and be with him she said trembling and breathing quickly 
 and not letting them interrupt her she went on to tell what she had never yet mentioned to anyone all she had lived through during those three weeks of their journey and life at yaroslavl 
 pierre listened to her with lips parted and eyes fixed upon her full of tears as he listened he did not think of prince andrew nor of death nor of what she was telling he listened to her and felt only pity for her for what she was suffering now while she was speaking 
 princess mary frowning in her effort to hold back her tears sat beside natasha and heard for the first time the story of those last days of her and love 
 evidently natasha needed to tell that painful yet joyful tale 
 she spoke mingling most trifling details with the intimate secrets of her soul and it seemed as if she could never finish several times she repeated the same thing twice 
 dessalles voice was heard outside the door asking whether little nicholas might come in to say good night 
 well all everything said natasha 
 she got up quickly just as nicholas entered almost ran to the door which was hidden by curtains struck her head against it and rushed from the room with a moan either of pain or sorrow 
 pierre gazed at the door through which she had disappeared and did not understand why he suddenly felt all alone in the world 
 princess mary roused him from his abstraction by drawing his attention to her nephew who had entered the room 
 at that moment of emotional tenderness young nicholas face which resembled his affected pierre so much that when he had kissed the boy he got up quickly took out his handkerchief and went to the window he wished to take leave of princess mary but she would not let him go 
 no natasha and i sometimes go to sleep till after two so please go i will order supper go downstairs we will come immediately 
 before pierre left the room princess mary told him this is the first time she has talked of him like that

 chapter iii 
 
 the spun man 
 this justice must be rendered to the police of that period that even in the most serious public junctures it imperturbably fulfilled its duties connected with the sewers and surveillance a revolt was in its eyes no pretext for allowing malefactors to take the bit in their own mouths and for neglecting society for the reason that the government was in peril 
 the ordinary service was performed correctly in company with the extraordinary service and was not troubled by the latter 
 in the midst of an incalculable political event already begun under the pressure of a possible revolution a police agent spun a thief without allowing himself to be distracted by insurrection and barricades 
 it was something precisely parallel which took place on the afternoon of the th of june on the banks of the seine on the slope of the right shore a little beyond the pont des invalides 
 there is no longer any bank there now 
 the aspect of the locality has changed 
 on that bank two men separated by a certain distance seemed to be watching each other while mutually avoiding each other 
 the one who was in advance was trying to get away the one in the rear was trying to overtake the other 
 it was like a game of checkers played at a distance and in silence neither seemed to be in any hurry and both walked slowly as though each of them feared by too much haste to make his partner redouble his pace 
 one would have said that it was an appetite following its prey and purposely without wearing the air of doing so 
 the prey was crafty and on its guard 
 the proper relations between the hunted and the hunting dog were observed 
 the one who was seeking to escape had an insignificant mien and not an impressive appearance the one who was seeking to seize him was rude of aspect and must have been rude to encounter 
 the first conscious that he was the more feeble avoided the second but he avoided him in a manner which was deeply furious any one who could have observed him would have discerned in his eyes the sombre hostility of flight and all the menace that fear contains 
 the shore was deserted there were no not even a boatman nor a was in the skiffs which were moored here and there 
 it was not easy to see these two men except from the quay opposite and to any person who had scrutinized them at that distance the man who was in advance would have appeared like a bristling tattered and equivocal being who was uneasy and trembling beneath a ragged blouse and the other like a classic and official personage wearing the of authority buttoned to the chin 
 perchance the reader might recognize these two men if he were to see them closer at hand 
 what was the object of the second man 
 probably to succeed in clothing the first more warmly 
 when a man clothed by the state pursues a man in rags it is in order to make of him a man who is also clothed by the state 
 only the whole question lies in the color 
 to be dressed in blue is glorious to be dressed in red is disagreeable 
 there is a purple from below 
 it is probably some unpleasantness and some purple of this sort which the first man is desirous of shirking 
 if the other allowed him to walk on and had not seized him as yet it was judging from all appearances in the hope of seeing him lead up to some significant and to some group worth catching this delicate operation is called spinning 
 what renders this conjecture entirely probable is that the man on catching sight from the shore of a on the quay as it was passing along empty made a sign to the driver the driver understood evidently recognized the person with whom he had to deal turned about and began to follow the two men at the top of the quay at a this was not observed by the slouching and tattered personage who was in advance 
 the rolled along the trees of the the bust of the driver whip in hand could be seen moving along above the parapet 
 one of the secret instructions of the police authorities to their agents contains this article 
 always have on hand a in case of emergency 
 while these two men were manoeuvring each on his own side with irreproachable strategy they approached an inclined plane on the quay which descended to the shore and which permitted arriving from passy to come to the river and water their horses this inclined plane was suppressed later on for the sake of symmetry horses may die of thirst but the eye is gratified 
 it is probable that the man in the blouse had intended to ascend this inclined plane with a view to making his escape into the a place ornamented with trees but in return much infested with policemen and where the other could easily exercise violence 
 this point on the quay is not very far distant from the house brought to paris from moret in by colonel brack and designated as the house of francois i a guard house is situated close at hand 
 to the great surprise of his watcher the man who was being tracked did not mount by the inclined plane for watering 
 he continued to advance along the quay on the shore 
 his position was visibly becoming critical 
 what was he intending to do if not to throw himself into the seine 
 henceforth there existed no means of ascending to the quay there was no other inclined plane no staircase and they were near the spot marked by the bend in the seine towards the pont de jena where the bank growing constantly narrower ended in a slender tongue and was lost in the water 
 there he would inevitably find himself blocked between the perpendicular wall on his right the river on his left and in front of him and the authorities on his heels 
 it is true that this termination of the shore was hidden from sight by a heap of rubbish six or seven feet in height produced by some demolition or other 
 but did this man hope to conceal himself effectually behind that heap of rubbish which one need but skirt the expedient would have been puerile 
 he certainly was not dreaming of such a thing 
 the innocence of thieves does not extend to that point 
 the pile of rubbish formed a sort of projection at the edge which was prolonged in a promontory as far as the wall of the quay 
 the man who was being followed arrived at this little mound and went round it so that he ceased to be seen by the other 
 the latter as he did not see could not be seen he took advantage of this fact to abandon all dissimulation and to walk very rapidly in a few moments he had reached the rubbish heap and passed round it there he halted in sheer amazement 
 the man whom he had been pursuing was no longer there 
 total eclipse of the man in the blouse 
 the shore beginning with the rubbish heap was only about thirty paces long then it plunged into the water which beat against the wall of the quay 
 the fugitive could not have thrown himself into the seine without being seen by the man who was following him what had become of him 
 the man in the coat walked to the extremity of the shore and remained there in thought for a moment his fists clenched his eyes searching 
 all at once he smote his brow 
 he had just perceived at the point where the land came to an end and the water began a large iron grating low arched garnished with a heavy lock and with three massive hinges 
 this grating a sort of door pierced at the base of the quay opened on the river as well as on the shore 
 a blackish stream passed under it this stream discharged into the seine 
 beyond the heavy rusty iron bars a sort of dark and vaulted corridor could be descried 
 the man folded his arms and stared at the grating with an air of reproach 
 as this gaze did not suffice he tried to thrust it aside he shook it it resisted solidly 
 it is probable that it had just been opened although no sound had been heard a singular circumstance in so rusty a grating but it is certain that it had been closed again this indicated that the man before whom that door had just opened had not a hook but a key 
 this evidence suddenly burst upon the mind of the man who was trying to move the grating and evoked from him this indignant ejaculation 
 that is too much 
 a government key 
 then immediately regaining his composure he expressed a whole world of interior ideas by this outburst of monosyllables accented almost ironically 
 come 
 come 
 come 
 come 
 that said and in the hope of something or other either that he should see the man emerge or other men enter he posted himself on the watch behind a heap of rubbish with the patient rage of a pointer 
 the which regulated all its movements on his had in its turn halted on the quay above him close to the parapet the coachman foreseeing a prolonged wait encased his horses muzzles in the bag of oats which is damp at the bottom and which is so familiar to parisians to whom be it said in parenthesis the government sometimes applies it 
 the rare on the pont de jena turned their heads before they pursued their way to take a momentary glance at these two motionless items in the landscape the man on the shore the carriage on the quay

 pierre was shown into the large brightly lit dining room a few minutes later he heard footsteps and princess mary entered with natasha natasha was calm though a severe and grave expression had again settled on her face they all three of them now experienced that feeling of awkwardness which usually follows after a serious and heartfelt talk it is impossible to go back to the same conversation to talk of trifles is awkward and yet the desire to speak is there and silence seems like affectation they went silently to table the footmen drew back the chairs and pushed them up again pierre unfolded his cold table napkin and resolving to break the silence looked at natasha and at princess mary they had evidently both formed the same resolution the eyes of both shone with satisfaction and a confession that besides sorrow life also has joy 
 do you take vodka count asked princess mary and those words suddenly banished the shadows of the past now tell us about yourself said she one hears such improbable wonders about you 
 yes replied pierre with the smile of mild irony now habitual to him they even tell me wonders i myself never dreamed of mary abramovna invited me to her house and kept telling me what had happened or ought to have happened to me stepan stepanych also instructed me how i ought to tell of my experiences in general i have noticed that it is very easy to be an interesting man i am an interesting man now people invite me out and tell me all about myself 
 natasha smiled and was on the point of speaking 
 we have been told princess mary interrupted her that you lost two millions in moscow is that true 
 but i am three times as rich as before returned pierre 
 though the position was now altered by his decision to pay his debts and to rebuild his houses pierre still maintained that he had become three times as rich as before 
 what i have certainly gained is freedom he began seriously but did not continue noticing that this theme was too egotistic 
 and are you building 
 yes savelich says i must 
 tell me you did not know of the countess death when you decided to remain in moscow asked princess mary and immediately blushed noticing that her question following his mention of freedom ascribed to his words a meaning he had perhaps not intended 
 no answered pierre evidently not considering awkward the meaning princess mary had given to his words i heard of it in orel and you cannot imagine how it shocked me we were not an exemplary couple he added quickly glancing at natasha and noticing on her face curiosity as to how he would speak of his wife but her death shocked me terribly when two people quarrel they are always both in fault and own guilt suddenly becomes terribly serious when the other is no longer alive and then such a death without friends and without consolation i am very very sorry for her he concluded and was pleased to notice a look of glad approval on face 
 yes and so you are once more an eligible bachelor said princess mary 
 pierre suddenly flushed crimson and for a long time tried not to look at natasha when he ventured to glance her way again her face was cold stern and he fancied even contemptuous 
 and did you really see and speak to napoleon as we have been told said princess mary 
 pierre laughed 
 no not once everybody seems to imagine that being taken prisoner means being guest not only did i never see him but i heard nothing about him i was in much lower company 
 supper was over and pierre who at first declined to speak about his captivity was gradually led on to do so 
 but true that you remained in moscow to kill napoleon natasha asked with a slight smile i guessed it then when we met at the sukharev tower do you remember 
 pierre admitted that it was true and from that was gradually led by princess questions and especially by into giving a detailed account of his adventures 
 at first he spoke with the amused and mild irony now customary with him toward everybody and especially toward himself but when he came to describe the horrors and sufferings he had witnessed he was unconsciously carried away and began speaking with the suppressed emotion of a man in recollection strong impressions he has lived through 
 princess mary with a gentle smile looked now at pierre and now at natasha in the whole narrative she saw only pierre and his goodness natasha leaning on her elbow the expression of her face constantly changing with the narrative watched pierre with an attention that never wandered evidently herself experiencing all that he described not only her look but her exclamations and the brief questions she put showed pierre that she understood just what he wished to convey it was clear that she understood not only what he said but also what he wished to but could not express in words the account pierre gave of the incident with the child and the woman for protecting whom he was arrested was this it was an awful sight children abandoned some in the flames one was snatched out before my eyes and there were women who had their things snatched off and their earrings torn out he flushed and grew confused then a patrol arrived and all the men all those who were not looting that is were arrested and i among them 
 i am sure not telling us everything i am sure you did something said natasha and pausing added something fine 
 pierre continued when he spoke of the execution he wanted to pass over the horrible details but natasha insisted that he should not omit anything 
 pierre began to tell about karataev but paused by this time he had risen from the table and was pacing the room natasha following him with her eyes then he added 
 no you understand what i learned from that illiterate man that simple fellow 
 yes yes go on said natasha where is he 
 they killed him almost before my eyes 
 and pierre his voice trembling continually went on to tell of the last days of their retreat of illness and his death 
 he told of his adventures as he had never yet recalled them he now as it were saw a new meaning in all he had gone through now that he was telling it all to natasha he experienced that pleasure which a man has when women listen to him not clever women who when listening either try to remember what they hear to enrich their minds and when opportunity offers to retell it or who wish to adopt it to some thought of their own and promptly contribute their own clever comments prepared in their little mental workshop but the pleasure given by real women gifted with a capacity to select and absorb the very best a man shows of himself natasha without knowing it was all attention she did not lose a word no single quiver in voice no look no twitch of a muscle in his face nor a single gesture she caught the unfinished word in its flight and took it straight into her open heart divining the secret meaning of all mental travail 
 princess mary understood his story and sympathized with him but she now saw something else that absorbed all her attention she saw the possibility of love and happiness between natasha and pierre and the first thought of this filled her heart with gladness 
 it was three in the morning the footmen came in with sad and stern faces to change the candles but no one noticed them 
 pierre finished his story natasha continued to look at him intently with bright attentive and animated eyes as if trying to understand something more which he had perhaps left untold pierre in shamefaced and happy confusion glanced occasionally at her and tried to think what to say next to introduce a fresh subject princess mary was silent it occurred to none of them that it was three and time to go to bed 
 people speak of misfortunes and sufferings remarked pierre but if at this moment i were asked would you rather be what you were before you were taken prisoner or go through all this again then for sake let me again have captivity and horseflesh we imagine that when we are thrown out of our usual ruts all is lost but it is only then that what is new and good begins while there is life there is happiness there is much much before us i say this to you he added turning to natasha 
 yes yes she said answering something quite different i too should wish nothing but to relive it all from the beginning 
 pierre looked intently at her 
 yes and nothing more said natasha 
 not true not true cried pierre i am not to blame for being alive and wishing to live nor you either 
 suddenly natasha bent her head covered her face with her hands and began to cry 
 what is it natasha said princess mary 
 nothing nothing she smiled at pierre through her tears good night it is time for bed 
 pierre rose and took his leave 
 princess mary and natasha met as usual in the bedroom they talked of what pierre had told them princess mary did not express her opinion of pierre nor did natasha speak of him 
 well good night mary said natasha do you know i am often afraid that by not speaking of him she meant prince andrew for fear of not doing justice to our feelings we forget him 
 princess mary sighed deeply and thereby acknowledged the justice of remark but she did not express agreement in words 
 is it possible to forget said she 
 it did me so much good to tell all about it today it was hard and painful but good very good said natasha i am sure he really loved him that is why i told him was it all right she added suddenly blushing 
 to tell pierre oh yes what a splendid man he is said princess mary 
 do you know mary natasha suddenly said with a mischievous smile such as princess mary had not seen on her face for a long time he has somehow grown so clean smooth and fresh as if he had just come out of a russian bath do you understand out of a moral bath it true 
 yes replied princess mary he has greatly improved 
 with a short coat and his hair cropped just as if well just as if he had come straight from the bath papa used to 
 i understand why he prince andrew liked no one so much as him said princess mary 
 yes and yet he is quite different they say men are friends when they are quite different that must be true really he is quite unlike him in everything 
 yes but wonderful 
 well good night said natasha 
 and the same mischievous smile lingered for a long time on her face as if it had been forgotten there

 he also bears his cross 
 jean valjean had resumed his march and had not again paused 
 this march became more and more laborious 
 the level of these vaults varies the average height is about five feet six inches and has been calculated for the stature of a man jean valjean was forced to bend over in order not to strike marius against the vault at every step he had to bend then to rise and to feel incessantly of the wall 
 the moisture of the stones and the viscous nature of the timber framework furnished but poor supports to which to cling either for hand or foot 
 he stumbled along in the hideous of the city 
 the intermittent gleams from the only appeared at very long intervals and were so wan that the full sunlight seemed like the light of the moon all the rest was mist miasma opaqueness blackness 
 jean valjean was both hungry and thirsty especially thirsty and this like the sea was a place full of water where a man cannot drink 
 his strength which was prodigious as the reader knows and which had been but little decreased by age thanks to his chaste and sober life began to give way nevertheless 
 fatigue began to gain on him and as his strength decreased it made the weight of his burden increase 
 marius who was perhaps dead weighed him down as inert bodies weigh 
 jean valjean held him in such a manner that his chest was not oppressed and so that respiration could proceed as well as possible 
 between his legs he felt the rapid gliding of the rats one of them was frightened to such a degree that he bit him from time to time a breath of fresh air reached him through the of the mouths of the sewer and him 
 it might have been three hours past midday when he reached the 
 he was at first astonished at this sudden widening 
 he found himself all at once in a gallery where his outstretched hands could not reach the two walls and beneath a vault which his head did not touch the grand sewer is in fact eight feet wide and seven feet high 
 at the point where the montmartre sewer joins the grand sewer two other subterranean galleries that of the rue de provence and that of the abattoir form a square 
 between these four ways a less sagacious man would have remained undecided 
 jean valjean selected the broadest that is to say the but here the question again came he descend or ascend he thought that the situation required haste and that he must now gain the seine at any risk 
 in other terms he must descend he turned to the left 
 it was well that he did so for it is an error to suppose that the has two outlets the one in the direction of bercy the other towards passy and that it is as its name indicates the subterranean girdle of the paris on the right bank 
 the grand sewer which is it must be remembered nothing else than the old brook of menilmontant terminates if one ascends it in a blind sack that is to say at its ancient point of departure which was its source at the foot of the knoll of menilmontant 
 there is no direct communication with the branch which collects the waters of paris beginning with the quartier popincourt and which falls into the seine through the amelot sewer above the ancient isle louviers this branch which completes the collecting sewer is separated from it under the rue menilmontant itself by a pile which marks the dividing point of the waters between upstream and downstream if jean valjean had ascended the gallery he would have arrived after a thousand efforts and broken down with fatigue and in an expiring condition in the gloom at a wall 
 he would have been lost 
 in case of necessity by retracing his steps a little way and entering the passage of the on condition that he did not hesitate at the subterranean crossing of the carrefour boucherat and by taking the corridor then the gut on the left then turning to the right and avoiding the gallery he might have reached the amelot sewer and thence provided that he did not go astray in the sort of f which lies under the bastille he might have attained the outlet on the seine near the arsenal but in order to do this he must have been thoroughly familiar with the enormous madrepore of the sewer in all its ramifications and in all its openings 
 now we must again insist that he knew nothing of that frightful drain which he was traversing and had any one asked him in what he was he would have answered in the night 
 his instinct served him well 
 to descend was in fact possible safety 
 he left on his right the two narrow passages which branch out in the form of a claw under the rue laffitte and the rue and the long bifurcated corridor of the chaussee 
 a little beyond an affluent which was probably the madeleine branch he halted 
 he was extremely weary 
 a passably large probably the in the rue furnished a light that was almost vivid jean valjean with the gentleness of movement which a brother would exercise towards his wounded brother deposited marius on the banquette of the sewer 
 marius face appeared under the wan light of the like the ashes at the bottom of a tomb his eyes were closed his hair was plastered down on his temples like a brushes dried in red wash his hands hung limp and dead 
 a clot of blood had collected in the knot of his cravat his limbs were cold and blood was clotted at the corners of his mouth his shirt had thrust itself into his wounds the cloth of his coat was chafing the yawning gashes in the living flesh jean valjean pushing aside the garments with the tips of his fingers laid his hand upon marius breast his heart was still beating jean valjean tore up his shirt bandaged the young wounds as well as he was able and stopped the flowing blood then bending over marius who still lay unconscious and almost without breathing in that half light he gazed at him with inexpressible hatred 
 on disarranging marius garments he had found two things in his pockets the roll which had been forgotten there on the preceding evening and marius pocketbook 
 he ate the roll and opened the pocketbook on the first page he found the four lines written by marius the reader will recall them 
 my name is marius pontmercy 
 carry my body to my grandfather m gillenormand rue des no in the marais 
 jean valjean read these four lines by the light of the and remained for a moment as though absorbed in thought repeating in a low tone 
 rue des number monsieur gillenormand 
 he replaced the pocketbook in marius pocket 
 he had eaten his strength had returned to him he took marius up once more upon his back placed the head carefully on his right shoulder and resumed his descent of the sewer 
 the grand sewer directed according to the course of the valley of menilmontant is about two leagues long 
 it is paved throughout a notable portion of its extent 
 this torch of the names of the streets of paris with which we are illuminating for the reader jean subterranean march jean valjean himself did not possess 
 nothing told him what zone of the city he was traversing nor what way he had made only the growing pallor of the pools of light which he encountered from time to time indicated to him that the sun was withdrawing from the pavement and that the day would soon be over and the rolling of vehicles overhead having become intermittent instead of continuous then having almost ceased he concluded that he was no longer under central paris and that he was approaching some solitary region in the vicinity of the outer boulevards or the extreme outer quays where there are fewer houses and streets the sewer has fewer the gloom deepened around jean valjean 
 nevertheless he continued to advance groping his way in the dark 
 suddenly this darkness became terrible

 book fifteen 
 chapter xviii 
 
 it was a long time before pierre could fall asleep that night he paced up and down his room now turning his thoughts on a difficult problem and frowning now suddenly shrugging his shoulders and wincing and now smiling happily 
 he was thinking of prince andrew of natasha and of their love at one moment jealous of her past then reproaching himself for that feeling it was already six in the morning and he still paced up and down the room 
 well to be done if it cannot be avoided to be done evidently it has to be so said he to himself and hastily undressing he got into bed happy and agitated but free from hesitation or indecision 
 strange and impossible as such happiness seems i must do everything that she and i may be man and wife he told himself 
 a few days previously pierre had decided to go to petersburg on the friday when he awoke on the thursday savelich came to ask him about packing for the journey 
 what to petersburg what is petersburg who is there in petersburg he asked involuntarily though only to himself oh yes long ago before this happened i did for some reason mean to go to petersburg he reflected why but perhaps i shall go what a good fellow he is and how attentive and how he remembers everything he thought looking at old face and what a pleasant smile he has 
 well savelich do you still not wish to accept your freedom pierre asked him 
 the good of freedom to me your excellency we lived under the late count the kingdom of heaven be his and we have lived under you too without ever being wronged 
 and your children 
 the children will live just the same with such masters one can live 
 but what about my heirs said pierre supposing i suddenly marry it might happen he added with an involuntary smile 
 if i may take the liberty your excellency it would be a good thing 
 how easy he thinks it thought pierre he know how terrible it is and how dangerous too soon or too late it is terrible 
 so what are your orders are you starting tomorrow asked savelich 
 no put it off for a bit tell you later you must forgive the trouble i have put you to said pierre and seeing savelich smile he thought but how strange it is that he should not know that now there is no petersburg for me and that that must be settled first of all but probably he knows it well enough and is only pretending shall i have a talk with him and see what he thinks pierre reflected no another time 
 at breakfast pierre told the princess his cousin that he had been to see princess mary the day before and had there met whom do you think natasha rostova 
 the princess seemed to see nothing more extraordinary in that than if he had seen anna semenovna 
 do you know her asked pierre 
 i have seen the princess she replied i heard that they were arranging a match for her with young rostov it would be a very good thing for the rostovs they are said to be utterly ruined 
 no i mean do you know natasha rostova 
 i heard about that affair of hers at the time it was a great pity 
 no she either understand or is pretending thought pierre better not say anything to her either 
 the princess too had prepared provisions for journey 
 how kind they all are thought pierre what is surprising is that they should trouble about these things now when it can no longer be of interest to them and all for me 
 on the same day the chief of police came to pierre inviting him to send a representative to the faceted palace to recover things that were to be returned to their owners that day 
 and this man too thought pierre looking into the face of the chief of police what a fine officer and how kind fancy bothering about such trifies now and they actually say he is not honest and takes bribes what nonsense besides why he take bribes the way he was brought up and everybody does it but what a kind pleasant face and how he smiles as he looks at me 
 pierre went to princess to dinner 
 as he drove through the streets past the houses that had been burned down he was surprised by the beauty of those ruins the picturesqueness of the chimney stacks and walls of the quarters of the town stretching out and concealing one another reminded him of the rhine and the colosseum the cabmen he met and their passengers the carpenters cutting the timber for new houses with axes the women hawkers and the shopkeepers all looked at him with cheerful beaming eyes that seemed to say ah there he is see what will come of it 
 at the entrance to princess house pierre felt doubtful whether he had really been there the night before and really seen natasha and talked to her perhaps i imagined it perhaps i shall go in and find no one there but he had hardly entered the room before he felt her presence with his whole being by the loss of his sense of freedom she was in the same black dress with soft folds and her hair was done the same way as the day before yet she was quite different had she been like this when he entered the day before he could not for a moment have failed to recognize her 
 she was as he had known her almost as a child and later on as prince fiancee a bright questioning light shone in her eyes and on her face was a friendly and strangely roguish expression 
 pierre dined with them and would have spent the whole evening there but princess mary was going to vespers and pierre left the house with her 
 next day he came early dined and stayed the whole evening though princess mary and natasha were evidently glad to see their visitor and though all interest was now centered in that house by the evening they had talked over everything and the conversation passed from one trivial topic to another and repeatedly broke off he stayed so long that princess mary and natasha exchanged glances evidently wondering when he would go pierre noticed this but could not go he felt uneasy and embarrassed but sat on because he simply could not get up and take his leave 
 princess mary foreseeing no end to this rose first and complaining of a headache began to say good night 
 so you are going to petersburg tomorrow she asked 
 no i am not going pierre replied hastily in a surprised tone and as though offended yes no to petersburg tomorrow but i say yet i will call round in case you have any commissions for me said he standing before princess mary and turning red but not taking his departure 
 natasha gave him her hand and went out princess mary on the other hand instead of going away sank into an armchair and looked sternly and intently at him with her deep radiant eyes the weariness she had plainly shown before had now quite passed off with a deep and sigh she seemed to be prepared for a lengthy talk 
 when natasha left the room confusion and awkwardness immediately vanished and were replaced by eager excitement he quickly moved an armchair toward princess mary 
 yes i wanted to tell you said he answering her look as if she had spoken princess help me what am i to do can i hope princess my dear friend listen i know it all i know i am not worthy of her i know impossible to speak of it now but i want to be a brother to her no not that i i 
 he paused and rubbed his face and eyes with his hands 
 well he went on with an evident effort at and coherence i know when i began to love her but i have loved her and her alone all my life and i love her so that i cannot imagine life without her i cannot propose to her at present but the thought that perhaps she might someday be my wife and that i may be missing that possibility that possibility is terrible tell me can i hope tell me what i am to do dear princess he added after a pause and touched her hand as she did not reply 
 i am thinking of what you have told me answered princess mary this is what i will say you are right that to speak to her of love at present 
 princess mary stopped she was going to say that to speak of love was impossible but she stopped because she had seen by the sudden change in natasha two days before that she would not only not be hurt if pierre spoke of his love but that it was the very thing she wished for 
 to speak to her now do said the princess all the same 
 but what am i to do 
 leave it to me said princess mary i know 
 pierre was looking into princess eyes 
 well well he said 
 i know that she loves will love you princess mary corrected herself 
 before her words were out pierre had sprung up and with a frightened expression seized princess hand 
 what makes you think so you think i may hope you think 
 yes i think so said princess mary with a smile write to her parents and leave it to me i will tell her when i can i wish it to happen and my heart tells me it will 
 no it cannot be how happy i am but it be how happy i am no it be pierre kept saying as he kissed princess hands 
 go to petersburg that will be best and i will write to you she said 
 to petersburg go there very well go but i may come again tomorrow 
 next day pierre came to say natasha was less animated than she had been the day before but that day as he looked at her pierre sometimes felt as if he was vanishing and that neither he nor she existed any longer that nothing existed but happiness is it possible no it be he told himself at every look gesture and word that filled his soul with joy 
 when on saying he took her thin slender hand he could not help holding it a little longer in his own 
 is it possible that this hand that face those eyes all this treasure of feminine charm so strange to me now is it possible that it will one day be mine forever as familiar to me as i am to myself no impossible 
 count she said aloud i shall look forward very much to your return she added in a whisper 
 and these simple words her look and the expression on her face which accompanied them formed for two months the subject of inexhaustible memories interpretations and happy meditations for pierre i shall look forward very much to your return yes yes how did she say it yes i shall look forward very much to your return oh how happy i am what is happening to me how happy i am said pierre to himself

 book but the soul 
 chapter v 
 
 in the case of sand as in that of woman there is a fineness which is treacherous 
 he felt that he was entering the water and that he no longer had a pavement under his feet but only mud 
 it sometimes happens that on certain shores of bretagne or scotland a man either a traveller or a fisherman while walking at low tide on the beach far from shore suddenly notices that for several minutes past he has been walking with some difficulty the beach under foot is like pitch his soles stick fast to it it is no longer sand it is the strand is perfectly dry but at every step that he takes as soon as the foot is raised the print is filled with water 
 the eye however has perceived no change the immense beach is smooth and tranquil all the sand has the same aspect nothing distinguishes the soil that is solid from that which is not solid the joyous little cloud of continues to leap tumultuously under the feet of the 
 the man pursues his way he walks on turns towards the land endeavors to approach the shore 
 he is not uneasy 
 uneasy about what only he is conscious that the heaviness of his feet seems to be increasing at every step that he takes 
 all at once he sinks in he sinks in two or three inches 
 decidedly he is not on the right road he halts to get his bearings 
 suddenly he glances at his feet his feet have disappeared 
 the sand has covered them 
 he draws his feet out of the sand he tries to retrace his steps he turns back he sinks in more deeply than before 
 the sand is up to his ankles he tears himself free from it and flings himself to the left the sand reaches to he flings himself to the right the sand comes up to his knees 
 then with indescribable terror he recognizes the fact that he is caught in a quicksand and that he has beneath him that frightful medium in which neither man can walk nor fish can swim 
 he flings away his burden if he have one he lightens himself like a ship in distress it is too late the sand is above his knees 
 he shouts he waves his hat or his handkerchief the sand continually gains on him if the beach is deserted if the land is too far away if the bank of sand is too there is no hero in the neighborhood all is over he is condemned to be engulfed he is condemned to that terrible interment long infallible implacable which it is impossible to either retard or hasten which lasts for hours which will not come to an end which seizes you erect free in the flush of health which drags you down by the feet which at every effort that you attempt at every shout that you utter draws you a little lower which has the air of punishing you for your resistance by a redoubled grasp which forces a man to return slowly to earth while leaving him time to survey the horizon the trees the verdant country the smoke of the villages on the plain the sails of the ships on the sea the birds which fly and sing the sun and the sky 
 this engulfment is the sepulchre which assumes a tide and which mounts from the depths of the earth towards a living man 
 each minute is an inexorable of the dead the wretched man tries to sit down to lie down to climb every movement that he makes buries him deeper he straightens himself up he sinks he feels that he is being swallowed up he shrieks implores cries to the clouds wrings his hands grows desperate 
 behold him in the sand up to his belly the sand reaches to his breast he is only a bust now 
 he uplifts his hands utters furious groans clenches his nails on the beach tries to cling fast to that ashes supports himself on his elbows in order to raise himself from that soft sheath and sobs frantically the sand mounts higher 
 the sand has reached his shoulders the sand reaches to his throat only his face is visible now 
 his mouth cries aloud the sand fills it silence 
 his eyes still gaze forth the sand closes them night 
 then his brow decreases a little hair quivers above the sand a hand projects pierces the surface of the beach waves and disappears 
 sinister obliteration of a man 
 sometimes a rider is engulfed with his horse sometimes the carter is swallowed up with his cart all founders in that strand it is shipwreck elsewhere than in the water 
 it is the earth drowning a man 
 the earth permeated with the ocean becomes a pitfall it presents itself in the guise of a plain and it yawns like a wave the abyss is subject to these treacheries 
 this melancholy fate always possible on certain sea beaches was also possible thirty years ago in the sewers of paris 
 before the important works undertaken in the subterranean drain of paris was subject to these sudden slides 
 the water filtered into certain subjacent strata which were particularly friable the which was of as in the ancient sewers or of cement on concrete as in the new galleries having no longer an underpinning gave way a fold in a flooring of this sort means a crack means crumbling the framework crumbled away for a certain length 
 this crevice the hiatus of a gulf of mire was called a fontis in the special tongue what is a fontis 
 it is the quicksands of the seashore suddenly encountered under the surface of the earth it is the beach of mont in a sewer 
 the soaked soil is in a state of fusion as it were all its molecules are in suspension in soft medium it is not earth and it is not water 
 the depth is sometimes very great 
 nothing can be more formidable than such an encounter if the water predominates death is prompt the man is swallowed up if earth predominates death is slow 
 can any one picture to himself such a death 
 if being swallowed by the earth is terrible on the seashore what is it in a instead of the open air the broad daylight the clear horizon those vast sounds those free clouds whence rains life instead of those barks descried in the distance of that hope under all sorts of forms of probable of succor possible up to the very last of all this deafness blindness a black vault the inside of a tomb already prepared death in the mire beneath a cover slow suffocation by filth a stone box where asphyxia opens its claw in the mire and clutches you by the throat fetidness mingled with the slime instead of the strand sulfuretted hydrogen in place of the hurricane dung in place of the ocean 
 and to shout to gnash teeth and to writhe and to struggle and to agonize with that enormous city which knows nothing of it all over head 
 inexpressible is the horror of dying thus 
 death sometimes redeems his atrocity by a certain terrible dignity 
 on the funeral pile in shipwreck one can be great in the flames as in the foam a superb attitude is possible one there becomes transfigured as one perishes but not here 
 death is filthy 
 it is humiliating to expire the supreme floating visions are abject 
 mud is synonymous with shame it is petty ugly infamous 
 to die in a butt of malvoisie like clarence is permissible in the ditch of a scavenger like escoubleau is horrible 
 to struggle therein is hideous at the same time that one is going through the death agony one is floundering about 
 there are shadows enough for hell and mire enough to render it nothing but a slough and the dying man knows not whether he is on the point of becoming a spectre or a frog 
 everywhere else the sepulchre is sinister here it is deformed 
 the depth of the fontis varied as well as their length and their density according to the more or less bad quality of the sometimes a fontis was three or four feet deep sometimes eight or ten sometimes the bottom was unfathomable 
 here the mire was almost solid there almost liquid 
 in the luniere fontis it would have taken a man a day to disappear while he would have been devoured in five minutes by the philippeaux slough 
 the mire bears up more or less according to its density 
 a child can escape where a man will perish the first law of safety is to get rid of every sort of load every sewerman who felt the ground giving way beneath him began by flinging away his sack of tools or his or his hod 
 the fontis were due to different causes 
 the friability of the soil some landslip at a depth beyond the reach of man the violent summer rains the incessant flooding of winter long drizzling showers sometimes the weight of the surrounding houses on a marly or sandy soil forced out the vaults of the subterranean galleries and caused them to bend aside or it chanced that a flooring vault burst and split under this crushing thrust 
 in this manner the heaping up of the parthenon obliterated a century ago a portion of the vaults of hill 
 when a sewer was broken in under the pressure of the houses the mischief was sometimes betrayed in the street above by a sort of space like the teeth of a saw between the this crevice was developed in an undulating line throughout the entire length of the cracked vault and then the evil being visible the remedy could be promptly applied it also frequently happened that the interior ravages were not revealed by any external scar and in that case woe to the sewermen when they entered without precaution into the sewer they were liable to be lost 
 ancient registers make mention of several scavengers who were buried in fontis in this manner 
 they give many names among others that of the sewerman who was swallowed up in a quagmire under the of the rue a certain blaise poutrain this blaise poutrain was the brother of nicholas poutrain who was the last of the cemetery called the charnier des innocents in the epoch when that cemetery expired 
 there was also that young and charming vicomte of whom we have just spoken one of the heroes of the siege of lerida where they delivered the assault in silk stockings with violins at their head surprised one night at his the duchess de sourdis was drowned in a quagmire of the beautreillis sewer in which he had taken refuge in order to escape from the duke madame de sourdis when informed of his death demanded her and forgot to weep through sniffling at her salts in such cases there is no love which holds fast the sewer extinguishes it 
 hero refuses to wash the body of leander thisbe stops her nose in the presence of pyramus and says 
 phew

 chapter xix 
 
 there was nothing in soul now at all like what had troubled it during his courtship of helene 
 he did not repeat to himself with a sickening feeling of shame the words he had spoken or say oh why did i not say that and whatever made me say je vous aime on the contrary he now repeated in imagination every word that he or natasha had spoken and pictured every detail of her face and smile and did not wish to diminish or add anything but only to repeat it again and again there was now not a shadow of doubt in his mind as to whether what he had undertaken was right or wrong only one terrible doubt sometimes crossed his mind it all a dream princess mary mistaken am i not too conceited and i believe all this and suddenly princess mary will tell her and she will be sure to smile and say how strange he must be deluding himself he know that he is a man just a man while i i am something altogether different and higher 
 that was the only doubt often troubling pierre he did not now make any plans the happiness before him appeared so inconceivable that if only he could attain it it would be the end of all things everything ended with that 
 a joyful unexpected frenzy of which he had thought himself incapable possessed him the whole meaning of life not for him alone but for the whole world seemed to him centered in his love and the possibility of being loved by her at times everybody seemed to him to be occupied with one thing only his future happiness sometimes it seemed to him that other people were all as pleased as he was himself and merely tried to hide that pleasure by pretending to be busy with other interests in every word and gesture he saw allusions to his happiness he often surprised those he met by his significantly happy looks and smiles which seemed to express a secret understanding between him and them and when he realized that people might not be aware of his happiness he pitied them with his whole heart and felt a desire somehow to explain to them that all that occupied them was a mere frivolous trifle unworthy of attention 
 when it was suggested to him that he should enter the civil service or when the war or any general political affairs were discussed on the assumption that welfare depended on this or that issue of events he would listen with a mild and pitying smile and surprise people by his strange comments but at this time he saw everybody both those who as he imagined understood the real meaning of life that is what he was feeling and those unfortunates who evidently did not understand it in the bright light of the emotion that shone within himself and at once without any effort saw in everyone he met everything that was good and worthy of being loved 
 when dealing with the affairs and papers of his dead wife her memory aroused in him no feeling but pity that she had not known the bliss he now knew prince vasili who having obtained a new post and some fresh decorations was particularly proud at this time seemed to him a pathetic kindly old man much to be pitied 
 often in afterlife pierre recalled this period of blissful insanity all the views he formed of men and circumstances at this time remained true for him always he not only did not renounce them subsequently but when he was in doubt or inwardly at variance he referred to the views he had held at this time of his madness and they always proved correct 
 i may have appeared strange and queer then he thought but i was not so mad as i seemed on the contrary i was then wiser and had more insight than at any other time and understood all that is worth understanding in life because because i was happy 
 insanity consisted in not waiting as he used to do to discover personal attributes which he termed good qualities in people before loving them his heart was now overflowing with love and by loving people without cause he discovered indubitable causes for loving them

 the fontis 
 jean valjean found himself in the presence of a fontis 
 this sort of quagmire was common at that period in the subsoil of the difficult to handle in the hydraulic works and a bad preservative of the subterranean constructions on account of its excessive fluidity 
 this fluidity exceeds even the inconsistency of the sands of the quartier which could only be conquered by a stone construction on a concrete foundation and the clayey strata infected with gas of the quartier des martyrs which are so liquid that the only way in which a passage was effected under the gallery des martyrs was by means of a pipe 
 when in the old stone sewer beneath the faubourg in which we now see jean valjean was demolished for the purpose of reconstructing it the quicksand which forms the subsoil of the as far as the seine presented such an obstacle that the operation lasted nearly six months to the great clamor of the dwellers on the riverside particularly those who had hotels and carriages 
 the work was more than unhealthy it was dangerous 
 it is true that they had four months and a half of rain and three floods of the seine 
 the fontis which jean valjean had encountered was caused by the downpour of the preceding day 
 the pavement badly sustained by the subjacent sand had given way and had produced a stoppage of the water 
 infiltration had taken place a slip had followed the dislocated bottom had sunk into the ooze 
 to what extent impossible to say 
 the obscurity was more dense there than elsewhere it was a pit of mire in a cavern of night 
 jean valjean felt the pavement vanishing beneath his feet he entered this slime 
 there was water on the surface slime at the bottom 
 he must pass it 
 to retrace his steps was impossible marius was dying and jean valjean exhausted 
 besides where was he to go 
 jean valjean advanced 
 moreover the pit seemed for the first few steps not to be very deep 
 but in proportion as he advanced his feet plunged deeper 
 soon he had the slime up to his calves and water above his knees 
 he walked on raising marius in his arms as far above the water as he could the mire now reached to his knees and the water to his waist he could no longer retreat 
 this mud dense enough for one man could not obviously uphold two 
 marius and jean valjean would have stood a chance of extricating themselves singly 
 jean valjean continued to advance supporting the dying man who was perhaps a corpse 
 the water came up to his he felt that he was sinking it was only with difficulty that he could move in the depth of ooze which he had now reached 
 the density which was his support was also an obstacle 
 he still held marius on high and with an expenditure of force he advanced still but he was sinking he had only his head above the water now and his two arms holding up marius 
 in the old paintings of the deluge there is a mother holding her child thus 
 he sank still deeper he turned his face to the rear to escape the water and in order that he might be able to breathe anyone who had seen him in that gloom would have thought that what he beheld was a mask floating on the shadows he caught a faint glimpse above him of the drooping head and livid face of marius he made a desperate effort and launched his foot forward his foot struck something solid a point of support 
 it was high time 
 he straightened himself up and rooted himself upon that point of support with a sort of fury 
 this produced upon him the effect of the first step in a staircase leading back to life 
 the point of support thus encountered in the mire at the supreme moment was the beginning of the other of the pavement which had bent but had not given way and which had curved under the water like a plank and in a single piece 
 well built pavements form a vault and possess this sort of firmness 
 this fragment of the vaulting partly submerged but solid was a veritable inclined plane and once on this plane he was safe 
 jean valjean mounted this inclined plane and reached the other side of the quagmire 
 as he emerged from the water he came in contact with a stone and fell upon his knees 
 he reflected that this was but just and he remained there for some time with his soul absorbed in words addressed to god 
 he rose to his feet shivering chilled bowed beneath the dying man whom he was dragging after him all dripping with slime and his soul filled with a strange light

 chapter xx 
 
 after departure that first evening when natasha had said to princess mary with a gaily mocking smile he looks just yes just as if he had come out of a russian bath in a short coat and with his hair cropped something hidden and unknown to herself but irrepressible awoke in soul 
 everything her face walk look and voice was suddenly altered to her own surprise a power of life and hope of happiness rose to the surface and demanded satisfaction from that evening she seemed to have forgotten all that had happened to her she no longer complained of her position did not say a word about the past and no longer feared to make happy plans for the future she spoke little of pierre but when princess mary mentioned him a light once more kindled in her eyes and her lips curved with a strange smile 
 the change that took place in natasha at first surprised princess mary but when she understood its meaning it grieved her can she have loved my brother so little as to be able to forget him so soon she thought when she reflected on the change but when she was with natasha she was not vexed with her and did not reproach her the reawakened power of life that had seized natasha was so evidently irrepressible and unexpected by her that in her presence princess mary felt that she had no right to reproach her even in her heart 
 natasha gave herself up so fully and frankly to this new feeling that she did not try to hide the fact that she was no longer sad but bright and cheerful 
 when princess mary returned to her room after her nocturnal talk with pierre natasha met her on the threshold 
 he has spoken yes he has spoken she repeated 
 and a joyful yet pathetic expression which seemed to beg forgiveness for her joy settled on face 
 i wanted to listen at the door but i knew you would tell me 
 understandable and touching as the look with which natasha gazed at her seemed to princess mary and sorry as she was to see her agitation these words pained her for a moment she remembered her brother and his love 
 but to be done she help it thought the princess 
 and with a sad and rather stern look she told natasha all that pierre had said on hearing that he was going to petersburg natasha was astounded 
 to petersburg she repeated as if unable to understand 
 but noticing the grieved expression on princess face she guessed the reason of that sadness and suddenly began to cry 
 mary said she tell me what i should do i am afraid of being bad whatever you tell me i will do tell me 
 you love him 
 yes whispered natasha 
 then why are you crying i am happy for your sake said princess mary who because of those tears quite forgave joy 
 it be just yet someday think what fun it will be when i am his wife and you marry nicholas 
 natasha i have asked you not to speak of that let us talk about you 
 they were silent awhile 
 but why go to petersburg natasha suddenly asked and hastily replied to her own question but no no he must yes mary he must

 one sometimes runs aground when one fancies that one is disembarking 
 he set out on his way once more 
 however although he had not left his life in the fontis he seemed to have left his strength behind him there 
 that supreme effort had exhausted him 
 his lassitude was now such that he was obliged to pause for breath every three or four steps and lean against the wall 
 once he was forced to seat himself on the banquette in order to alter marius position and he thought that he should have to remain there 
 but if his vigor was dead his energy was not he rose again 
 he walked on desperately almost fast proceeded thus for a hundred paces almost without drawing breath and suddenly came in contact with the wall 
 he had reached an elbow of the sewer and arriving at the turn with head bent down he had struck the wall he raised his eyes and at the extremity of the vault far very far away in front of him he perceived a light 
 this time it was not that terrible light it was good white light 
 it was daylight jean valjean saw the outlet 
 a damned soul who in the midst of the furnace should suddenly perceive the outlet of gehenna would experience what jean valjean felt it would fly wildly with the stumps of its burned wings towards that radiant portal 
 jean valjean was no longer conscious of fatigue he no longer felt marius weight he found his legs once more of steel he ran rather than walked 
 as he approached the outlet became more and more distinctly defined 
 it was a pointed arch lower than the vault which gradually narrowed and narrower than the gallery which closed in as the vault grew lower the tunnel ended like the interior of a funnel a faulty construction imitated from the wickets of penitentiaries logical in a prison illogical in a sewer and which has since been corrected 
 jean valjean reached the outlet 
 there he halted 
 it certainly was the outlet but he could not get out 
 the arch was closed by a heavy grating and the grating which to all appearance rarely swung on its rusty hinges was clamped to its stone jamb by a thick lock which red with rust seemed like an enormous brick 
 the keyhole could be seen and the robust latch deeply sunk in the iron staple 
 the door was plainly it was one of those prison locks which old paris was so fond of lavishing 
 beyond the grating was the open air the river the daylight the shore very narrow but sufficient for escape 
 the distant quays paris that gulf in which one so easily hides oneself the broad horizon liberty 
 on the right down stream the bridge of jena was discernible on the left upstream the bridge of the invalides the place would have been a propitious one in which to await the night and to escape 
 it was one of the most solitary points in paris the shore which faces the flies were entering and emerging through the bars of the grating 
 it might have been eight in the evening the day was declining 
 jean valjean laid marius down along the wall on the dry portion of the vaulting then he went to the grating and clenched both fists round the bars the shock which he gave it was frenzied but it did not move 
 the grating did not stir 
 jean valjean seized the bars one after the other in the hope that he might be able to tear away the least solid and to make of it a lever wherewith to raise the door or to break the lock 
 not a bar stirred the teeth of a tiger are not more firmly fixed in their sockets no lever no prying possible 
 the obstacle was invincible there was no means of opening the gate 
 must he then stop there 
 what was he to do 
 what was to become of him 
 he had not the strength to retrace his steps to recommence the journey which he had already taken 
 besides how was he to again traverse that quagmire whence he had only extricated himself as by a miracle 
 and after the quagmire was there not the police patrol which assuredly could not be twice avoided and then whither was he to go 
 what direction should he pursue to follow the incline would not conduct him to his goal 
 if he were to reach another outlet he would find it obstructed by a plug or a grating 
 every outlet was undoubtedly closed in that manner chance had unsealed the grating through which he had entered but it was evident that all the other sewer mouths were barred he had only succeeded in escaping into a prison 
 all was over 
 everything that jean valjean had done was useless exhaustion had ended in failure 
 they were both caught in the immense and gloomy web of death and jean valjean felt the terrible spider running along those black strands and quivering in the shadows 
 he turned his back to the grating and fell upon the pavement hurled to earth rather than seated close to marius who still made no movement and with his head bent between his knees 
 this was the last drop of anguish 
 of what was he thinking during this profound depression neither of himself nor of marius 
 he was thinking of cosette

 first epilogue 
 chapter i 
 
 seven years had passed the sea of european history had subsided within its shores and seemed to have become calm but the mysterious forces that move humanity mysterious because the laws of their motion are unknown to us continued to operate 
 though the surface of the sea of history seemed motionless the movement of humanity went on as unceasingly as the flow of time various groups of people formed and dissolved the coming formation and dissolution of kingdoms and displacement of peoples was in course of preparation 
 the sea of history was not driven spasmodically from shore to shore as previously it was seething in its depths historic figures were not borne by the waves from one shore to another as before they now seemed to rotate on one spot the historical figures at the head of armies who formerly reflected the movement of the masses by ordering wars campaigns and battles now reflected the restless movement by political and diplomatic combinations laws and treaties 
 the historians call this activity of the historical figures the reaction 
 in dealing with this period they sternly condemn the historical personages who in their opinion caused what they describe as the reaction all the people of that period from alexander and napoleon to madame de stael photius schelling fichte chateaubriand and the rest pass before their stern judgment seat and are acquitted or condemned according to whether they conduced to progress or to reaction 
 according to their accounts a reaction took place at that time in russia also and the chief culprit was alexander i the same man who according to them was the chief cause of the liberal movement at the commencement of his reign being the savior of russia 
 there is no one in russian literature now from schoolboy essayist to learned historian who does not throw his little stone at alexander for things he did wrong at this period of his reign 
 he ought to have acted in this way and in that way in this case he did well and in that case badly he behaved admirably at the beginning of his reign and during but acted badly by giving a constitution to poland forming the holy alliance entrusting power to arakcheev favoring golitsyn and mysticism and afterwards shishkov and photius he also acted badly by concerning himself with the active army and disbanding the semenov regiment 
 it would take a dozen pages to enumerate all the reproaches the historians address to him based on their knowledge of what is good for humanity 
 what do these reproaches mean 
 do not the very actions for which the historians praise alexander i the liberal attempts at the beginning of his reign his struggle with napoleon the firmness he displayed in and the campaign of flow from the same sources the circumstances of his birth education and life that made his personality what it was and from which the actions for which they blame him the holy alliance the restoration of poland and the reaction of and later also flowed 
 in what does the substance of those reproaches lie 
 it lies in the fact that an historic character like alexander i standing on the highest possible pinnacle of human power with the blinding light of history focused upon him a character exposed to those strongest of all influences the intrigues flattery and inseparable from power a character who at every moment of his life felt a responsibility for all that was happening in europe and not a fictitious but a live character who like every man had his personal habits passions and impulses toward goodness beauty and truth that this character though not lacking in virtue the historians do not accuse him of that had not the same conception of the welfare of humanity fifty years ago as a professor who from his youth upwards has been occupied with learning that is with books and lectures and with taking notes from them 
 but even if we assume that fifty years ago alexander i was mistaken in his view of what was good for the people we must inevitably assume that the historian who judges alexander will also after the lapse of some time turn out to be mistaken in his view of what is good for humanity this assumption is all the more natural and inevitable because watching the movement of history we see that every year and with each new writer opinion as to what is good for mankind changes so that what once seemed good ten years later seems bad and vice versa and what is more we find at one and the same time quite contradictory views as to what is bad and what is good in history some people regard giving a constitution to poland and forming the holy alliance as praiseworthy in alexander while others regard it as blameworthy 
 the activity of alexander or of napoleon cannot be called useful or harmful for it is impossible to say for what it was useful or harmful if that activity displeases somebody this is only because it does not agree with his limited understanding of what is good whether the preservation of my house in moscow or the glory of the russian arms or the prosperity of the petersburg and other universities or the freedom of poland or the greatness of russia or the balance of power in europe or a certain kind of european culture called progress appear to me to be good or bad i must admit that besides these things the action of every historic character has other more general purposes inaccessible to me 
 but let us assume that what is called science can harmonize all contradictions and possesses an unchanging standard of good and bad by which to try historic characters and events let us say that alexander could have done everything differently let us say that with guidance from those who blame him and who profess to know the ultimate aim of the movement of humanity he might have arranged matters according to the program his present accusers would have given him of nationality freedom equality and progress these i think cover the ground let us assume that this program was possible and had then been formulated and that alexander had acted on it what would then have become of the activity of all those who opposed the tendency that then prevailed in the government an activity that in the opinion of the historians was good and beneficent their activity would not have existed there would have been no life there would have been nothing 
 if we admit that human life can be ruled by reason the possibility of life is destroyed

 book but the soul 
 chapter viii 
 
 the torn 
 in the midst of this prostration a hand was laid on his shoulder and a low voice said to him 
 half shares 
 some person in that gloom 
 nothing so closely resembles a dream as despair 
 jean valjean thought that he was dreaming he had heard no footsteps 
 was it possible 
 he raised his eyes 
 a man stood before him 
 this man was clad in a blouse his feet were bare he held his shoes in his left hand he had evidently removed them in order to reach jean valjean without allowing his steps to be heard 
 jean valjean did not hesitate for an instant 
 unexpected as was this encounter this man was known to him 
 the man was thenardier 
 although awakened so to speak with a start jean valjean accustomed to alarms and steeled to unforeseen shocks that must be promptly parried instantly regained possession of his presence of mind 
 moreover the situation could not be made worse a certain degree of distress is no longer capable of a crescendo and thenardier himself could add nothing to this blackness of this night 
 a momentary pause ensued 
 thenardier raising his right hand to a level with his forehead formed with it a shade then he brought his eyelashes together by screwing up his eyes a motion which in connection with a slight contraction of the mouth characterizes the sagacious attention of a man who is endeavoring to recognize another man 
 he did not succeed jean valjean as we have just stated had his back turned to the light and he was moreover so disfigured so bemired so bleeding that he would have been unrecognizable in full noonday 
 on the contrary illuminated by the light from the grating a cellar light it is true livid yet precise in its lividness thenardier as the energetic popular metaphor expresses it immediately leaped into jean eyes 
 this inequality of conditions sufficed to assure some advantage to jean valjean in that mysterious duel 
 which was on the point of beginning between the two situations and the two men 
 the encounter took place between jean valjean veiled and thenardier unmasked 
 jean valjean immediately perceived that thenardier did not recognize him 
 they surveyed each other for a moment in that as though taking each measure 
 thenardier was the first to break the silence 
 how are you going to manage to get out 
 jean valjean made no reply 
 thenardier continued 
 impossible to pick the lock of that gate 
 but still you must get out of this 
 that is true said jean valjean 
 well half shares then 
 what do you mean by that 
 you have killed that man all right 
 i have the key 
 thenardier pointed to marius 
 he went on 
 i know you but i want to help you 
 you must be a friend 
 jean valjean began to comprehend 
 thenardier took him for an assassin 
 thenardier resumed 
 listen comrade 
 you kill that man without looking to see what he had in his pockets 
 give me my half 
 open the door for you 
 and half drawing from beneath his tattered blouse a huge key he added 
 do you want to see how a key to liberty is made 
 look here 
 jean valjean remained expression belongs to the elder such a degree that he doubted whether what he beheld was real 
 it was providence appearing in horrible guise and his good angel springing from the earth in the form of thenardier 
 thenardier thrust his fist into a large pocket concealed under his blouse drew out a rope and offered it to jean valjean 
 hold on said he give you the rope to boot 
 what is the rope for 
 you will need a stone also but you can find one outside a heap of rubbish 
 what am i to do with a stone 
 idiot want to sling that stiff into the river need a stone and a rope otherwise it would float on the water 
 jean valjean took the rope 
 there is no one who does not occasionally accept in this mechanical way 
 thenardier snapped his fingers as though an idea had suddenly occurred to him 
 ah see here comrade how did you contrive to get out of that slough yonder 
 i dared to risk myself in it 
 phew you smell good 
 after a pause he added 
 asking you questions but perfectly right not to answer an apprenticeship against that cursed quarter of an hour before the examining magistrate 
 and then when you talk at all you run no risk of talking too loud 
 no matter as i see your face and as i know your name you are wrong in supposing that i know who you are and what you want 
 i twig broken up that gentleman a bit now you want to tuck him away somewhere 
 the river that great hider of folly is what you want get you out of your scrape 
 helping a good fellow in a pinch is what suits me to a hair 
 while expressing his approval of jean silence he endeavored to force him to talk 
 he jostled his shoulder in an attempt to catch a sight of his profile and he exclaimed without however raising his tone 
 apropos of that quagmire a hearty animal 
 why you toss the man in there 
 jean valjean preserved silence 
 thenardier resumed pushing the rag which served him as a cravat to the level of his apple a gesture which completes the capable air of a serious man 
 after all you acted wisely 
 the workmen when they come to stop up that hole would certainly have found the stiff abandoned there and it might have been possible thread by thread straw by straw to pick up the scent and reach you 
 some one has passed through the sewer 
 who 
 where did he get out 
 was he seen to come out the police are full of cleverness 
 the sewer is treacherous and tells tales of you 
 such a find is a rarity it attracts attention very few people make use of the sewers for their affairs while the river belongs to everybody 
 the river is the true grave at the end of a month they fish up your man in the nets at well what does one care for that 
 carrion who killed that man 
 paris 
 and justice makes no inquiries you have done well 
 the more loquacious thenardier became the more mute was jean valjean 
 again thenardier shook him by the shoulder 
 now settle this business 
 go shares 
 you have seen my key show me your money 
 thenardier was haggard fierce suspicious rather menacing yet amicable 
 there was one singular circumstance manners were not simple he had not the air of being wholly at his ease while affecting an air of mystery he spoke low from time to time he laid his finger on his mouth and muttered hush 
 it was difficult to divine why 
 there was no one there except themselves jean valjean thought that other ruffians might possibly be concealed in some nook not very far off and that thenardier did not care to share with them 
 thenardier resumed 
 settle up 
 how much did the stiff have in his bags 
 jean valjean searched his pockets 
 it was his habit as the reader will remember to always have some money about him 
 the mournful life of expedients to which he had been condemned imposed this as a law upon him 
 on this occasion however he had been caught unprepared 
 when donning his uniform of a national guardsman on the preceding evening he had forgotten dolefully absorbed as he was to take his he had only some small change in his fob 
 he turned out his pocket all soaked with ooze and spread out on the banquette of the vault one louis two pieces and five or six large sous 
 thenardier thrust out his lower lip with a significant twist of the neck 
 you knocked him over cheap said he 
 he set to feeling the pockets of jean valjean and marius with the greatest familiarity 
 jean valjean who was chiefly concerned in keeping his back to the light let him have his way 
 while handling marius coat thenardier with the skill of a pickpocket and without being noticed by jean valjean tore off a strip which he concealed under his blouse probably thinking that this morsel of stuff might serve later on to identify the assassinated man and the assassin 
 however he found no more than the thirty francs 
 true said he both of you together have no more than that 
 and forgetting his motto 
 half shares he took all 
 he hesitated a little over the large sous 
 after due reflection he took them also muttering 
 never mind 
 you cut folks throats too cheap altogether 
 that done he once more drew the big key from under his blouse 
 now my friend you must leave 
 like the fair here you pay when you go out 
 you have paid now clear out 
 and he began to laugh 
 had he in lending to this stranger the aid of his key and in making some other man than himself emerge from that portal the pure and disinterested intention of rescuing an assassin we may be permitted to doubt this 
 thenardier helped jean valjean to replace marius on his shoulders then he betook himself to the grating on tiptoe and barefooted making jean valjean a sign to follow him looked out laid his finger on his mouth and remained for several seconds as though in suspense his inspection finished he placed the key in the lock 
 the bolt slipped back and the gate swung open 
 it neither grated nor squeaked it moved very softly 
 it was obvious that this gate and those hinges carefully oiled were in the habit of opening more frequently than was supposed this softness was suspicious it hinted at furtive goings and comings silent entrances and exits of nocturnal men and the tread of crime 
 the sewer was evidently an accomplice of some mysterious band this taciturn grating was a receiver of stolen goods 
 thenardier opened the gate a little way allowing just sufficient space for jean valjean to pass out closed the grating again gave the key a double turn in the lock and plunged back into the darkness without making any more noise than a breath he seemed to walk with the velvet paws of a tiger 
 a moment later that hideous providence had retreated into the invisibility 
 jean valjean found himself in the open air

 first epilogue 
 chapter ii 
 
 if we assume as the historians do that great men lead humanity to the attainment of certain ends the greatness of russia or of france the balance of power in europe the diffusion of the ideas of the revolution general progress or anything else then it is impossible to explain the facts of history without introducing the conceptions of chance and genius 
 if the aim of the european wars at the beginning of the nineteenth century had been the aggrandizement of russia that aim might have been accomplished without all the preceding wars and without the invasion if the aim wag the aggrandizement of france that might have been attained without the revolution and without the empire if the aim was the dissemination of ideas the printing press could have accomplished that much better than warfare if the aim was the progress of civilization it is easy to see that there are other ways of diffusing civilization more expedient than by the destruction of wealth and of human lives 
 why did it happen in this and not in some other way 
 because it happened so chance created the situation genius utilized it says history 
 but what is chance what is genius 
 the words chance and genius do not denote any really existing thing and therefore cannot be defined those words only denote a certain stage of understanding of phenomena i do not know why a certain event occurs i think that i cannot know it so i do not try to know it and i talk about chance i see a force producing effects beyond the scope of ordinary human agencies i do not understand why this occurs and i talk of genius 
 to a herd of rams the ram the herdsman drives each evening into a special enclosure to feed and that becomes twice as fat as the others must seem to be a genius and it must appear an astonishing conjunction of genius with a whole series of extraordinary chances that this ram who instead of getting into the general fold every evening goes into a special enclosure where there are oats that this very ram swelling with fat is killed for meat 
 but the rams need only cease to suppose that all that happens to them happens solely for the attainment of their sheepish aims they need only admit that what happens to them may also have purposes beyond their ken and they will at once perceive a unity and coherence in what happened to the ram that was fattened even if they do not know for what purpose they are fattened they will at least know that all that happened to the ram did not happen accidentally and will no longer need the conceptions of chance or genius 
 only by renouncing our claim to discern a purpose immediately intelligible to us and admitting the ultimate purpose to be beyond our ken may we discern the sequence of experiences in the lives of historic characters and perceive the cause of the effect they produce incommensurable with ordinary human capabilities and then the words chance and genius become superfluous 
 we need only confess that we do not know the purpose of the european convulsions and that we know only the facts that is the murders first in france then in italy in africa in prussia in austria in spain and in russia and that the movements from the west to the east and from the east to the west form the essence and purpose of these events and not only shall we have no need to see exceptional ability and genius in napoleon and alexander but we shall be unable to consider them to be anything but like other men and we shall not be obliged to have recourse to chance for an explanation of those small events which made these people what they were but it will be clear that all those small events were inevitable 
 by discarding a claim to knowledge of the ultimate purpose we shall clearly perceive that just as one cannot imagine a blossom or seed for any single plant better suited to it than those it produces so it is impossible to imagine any two people more completely adapted down to the smallest detail for the purpose they had to fulfill than napoleon and alexander with all their antecedents

 of plantations 
 plantations are amongst ancient primitive and heroical works when the world was young it begat more children but now it is old it begets fewer for i may jusuy account new plantations to be the children of former kingdoms i like a plantation in a pure soil that is where people are not displanted to the end to plant in others 
 for else it is rather an extirpation then a plantation planting of countries is like 
 planting of woeds for you must make account to lose almost twenty years profit 
 and expect your recompense in the end for the principal thing that hath been the 
 destruction of most plantations hath been the base and hasty drawing of profit in 
 the first years it is true speedy profit is not to be neglected as far as may stand 
 with the good of the plantation but no further it is a shameful and unblessed thing 
 to take the scum of people and wicked condemned men to be the people with whom you plant and not only so but it spoileth the plantation for they will ever live like rogues and not fall to work but be and do mischief and spend victuals and be quickly weary and then certify over to their country to the discredit of the plantation 
 the people wherewith you plant ought to be gardeners ploughmen 
 labourers smiths carpenters joiners fishermen fowlers with some few 
 apothecaries surgeons cooks and bakers in a country of plantation first look 
 about what kind of victual the country yields of itself to hand as chestnuts 
 walnuts pineapples olives dates plums cherries wild honey and the like and 
 make use of them then consider what victual or esculent things there are which 
 grow speedily and within the year as parsnips carrots turnips onions radish 
 artichokes of jerusalem maize and the like for wheat barley and oats they ask 
 too much labour but with peas and beans you may begin both because they ask less labour and because they serve for meat as well as for bread and of rice likewise cometh a great increase and it is a kind of meat above all there ought to be brought store of biscuit flower meal and the like in the beginning till bread may be had 
 for beasts or birds take chiefly such as are least subject to diseases 
 and multiply fastest as swine goats cocks hens turkeys geese and the like the victual in plantations ought to be expended almost as in a besieged town that is with certain allowance and let the main part of the ground employed to gardens or corn be to a common stock and to be laid in and stored up and then delivered out in proportion besides some spots of ground that any particular person will manure for his own private 
 consider likewise what commodities the soil where the plantation is doth naturally yield that they may some way help to defray the charge of the plantation so it be not as was said to the untimely prejudice of the main business as it hath fared with tobacco in virginia wood commonly aboundeth but too much and therefore timber is fit to be one if there be iron ore and streams whereupon to set the mills iron is a brave commodity where wood aboundeth making a bay salt if the climate be proper for it would be put in experience growing silk likewise if any be is a likely commodity pitch and tar where store of firs and pines are will not fail so drugs and sweet woods where they are cannot but yield great profit soap ashes likewise and other things that may be thought of but moil not too much under ground for the hope of mines is very uncertain and useth to make the planters lazy in other things for government let it be in the hands of one assisted with some counsel and let them have commission to exercise martial laws with some limitation 
 and above all let men make that profit of being in the wilderness as they have god always and his service before their eyes let not the government of the plantation depend upon too many counsellors and undertakers in the country that planteth but upon a temperate number and let those be rather noblemen and gentlemen than merchants for they look ever to the present gain let there be freedoms from custom till the plantation be of strength and not only freedom from custom but freedom to carry their commodities where they may make their best of them except there be some special cause of caution cram not in people by sending too fast company after company but rather hearken how they waste and send supplies proportionably but so as the number may live well in the plantation and not by surcharge be in penury it hath been a great endangering to the health of some plantations that they have built along the sea and rivers in marsh and unwholesome grounds 
 therefore though you begin there to avoid carriage and other like discommodities yet build still rather upwards from the streams than along it concerneth likewise the health of the plantation that they have good store of salt with them that they may use it in their victuals when it shall be necessary if you plant where savages are do not only entertain them with trifles and gingles but use them justly and graciously with sufficient guard nevertheless and do not win their favour by helping them to invade their enemies but for their defence it is not amiss and send oft of them over to the country that plants that they may see a better condition then their own and commend it when they return 
 when the plantation grows to strength then it is time to plant with women as well as with men that the plantation may spread into generations and not be ever pieced from without it is the sinfullest thing in the world to forsake or destitute a plantation once in forwardness for besides the dishonour it is the guiltiness of blood of many commiserable persons

 at 
 the russian mountains having been exhausted they began to think about dinner and the radiant party of eight somewhat weary at last became stranded in public house a branch establishment which had been set up in the by that famous bombarda whose sign could then be seen in the rue de rivoli near delorme alley 
 a large but ugly room with an alcove and a bed at the end they had been obliged to put up with this accommodation in view of the sunday crowd two windows whence they could survey beyond the elms the quay and the river a magnificent august sunlight lightly touching the panes two tables upon one of them a triumphant mountain of bouquets mingled with the hats of men and women at the other the four couples seated round a merry confusion of platters dishes glasses and bottles jugs of beer mingled with flasks of wine very little order on the table some disorder beneath it 
 they made beneath the table a noise a clatter of the feet that was abominable 
 says moliere 
 this was the state which the shepherd idyl begun at five in the morning had reached at four in the sun was setting their appetites were satisfied 
 the filled with sunshine and with people were nothing but light and dust the two things of which glory is horses of marly those neighing marbles were prancing in a cloud of gold 
 carriages were going and coming 
 a squadron of magnificent with their clarions at their head were descending the avenue de neuilly the white flag showing faintly rosy in the setting sun floated over the dome of the place de la concorde which had become the place louis more was choked with happy promenaders 
 many wore the silver suspended from the ribbon which had not yet wholly disappeared from in the year here and there choruses of little girls threw to the winds amid the passersby who formed into circles and applauded the then celebrated bourbon air which was destined to strike the hundred days with lightning and which had for its refrain notre pere de gand notre pere give us back our father from ghent give us back our father 
 groups of dwellers in the suburbs in sunday array sometimes even decorated with the like the bourgeois scattered over the large square and the marigny square were playing at rings and revolving on the wooden horses others were engaged in drinking some journeyman printers had on paper caps their laughter was thing was radiant 
 it was a time of undisputed peace and profound royalist security it was the epoch when a special and private report of chief of police angeles to the king on the subject of the suburbs of paris terminated with these lines 
 taking all things into consideration sire there is nothing to be feared from these people 
 they are as heedless and as indolent as populace is restless in the provinces it is not in are very pretty men sire 
 it would take all of two of them to make one of your grenadiers 
 there is nothing to be feared on the part of the populace of paris the capital 
 it is remarkable that the stature of this population should have diminished in the last fifty years and the populace of the suburbs is still more puny than at the time of the revolution 
 it is not short it is an amiable rabble 
 prefects of the police do not deem it possible that a cat can transform itself into a lion that does happen however and in that lies the miracle wrought by the populace of paris 
 moreover the cat so despised by count angles possessed the esteem of the republics of their eyes it was liberty incarnate and as though to serve as pendant to the minerva aptera of the piraeus there stood on the public square in corinth the colossal bronze figure of a ingenuous police of the restoration beheld the populace of paris in too a light it is not so much of an amiable rabble as it is thought 
 the parisian is to the frenchman what the athenian was to the greek 
 no one sleeps more soundly than he no one is more frankly frivolous and lazy than he no one can better assume the air of forgetfulness let him not be trusted nevertheless he is ready for any sort of cool deed but when there is glory at the end of it he is worthy of admiration in every sort of him a pike he will produce the th of august give him a gun you will have austerlitz 
 he is stay and it a question of country he enlists is it a question of liberty he tears up the pavements 
 beware his hair filled with wrath is epic his blouse drapes itself like the folds of a chlamys 
 take care he will make of the first rue grenetat which comes to hand caudine the hour strikes this man of the faubourgs will grow in stature this little man will arise and his gaze will be terrible and his breath will become a tempest and there will issue forth from that slender chest enough wind to disarrange the folds of the is thanks to the suburban man of paris that the revolution mixed with arms conquers europe 
 he sings it is his his song to his nature and you will see 
 as long as he has for refrain nothing but la carmagnole he only overthrows louis xvi make him sing the marseillaise and he will free the world 
 this note jotted down on the margin of angles report we will return to our four couples

 return of the jedi 
 iv 
 
 darth vader stepped out of the long cylindrical elevator into what had been the deathstar control room and now was the throne room two royal guards stoodeither side of the door red robes from neck to toe red helmets covering all buteyeslits that were actually electrically modified their weapons werealways drawn 
 the room was dim except for the light cables running either side of the elevatorshaft carrying power and information through the space station vader walkedacross the sleek black steel floor past the humming giant converter engines up theshort flight of steps to the platform level upon which sat the this platform off to the right was the mouth of the shaft that delved deeplyinto the pit of the battle station down to the very core of the power unit the chasmwas black and reeked of ozone and echoed continuously in a low hollow rumble 
 at the end of the overhanging platform was a wall in the wall a huge circularobservation window sitting in an elaborate before the window staringout into space was the emperor 
 the uncompleted half of the death star could be seen immediately beyond thewindow shuttles and transports buzzing around it men with doing exterior construction or surface work in the all this activity was the jade green moon endor resting like a jewel on theblack velvet of scattered to infinity the gleaming diamonds that were thestars 
 the emperor sat regarding this view as vader approached from behind thelord of sith kneeled and waited the emperor let him wait he perused the vistabefore him with a sense of glory beyond all reckoning this was all his and moreglorious still all his by his own hand 
 for it always so back in the days when he was merely senatorpalpatine the galaxy had been a knighthood that had watched it over it for inevitably it had grown too massive a bureaucracy had been too many years in order to maintain the republic corruption had set in 
 a few greedy senators had started the chain reaction of malaise some said butwho could know a few suddenly a fever was in the stars governor turned ongovernor values eroded trusts were had spread like an epidemic inthose early years rapidly and without visible cause and no one knew what washappening or why 
 and so senator palpatine had seized the moment through fraud cleverpromises and astute political maneuvering managed to get himself elected headof the council and then through subterfuge bribery and terror named himselfemperor 
 emperor it had a certain ring to it the republic had crumbled the empirewas resplendent with its own fires and would always be the emperor knewwhat others refused to believe the dark forces were the strongest 
 known this all along in his heart of relearned it every traitorous lieutenants who betrayed their superiors for favors functionaries who gave him the secrets of lords and sadisticgangsters and politicians no one was immune they all craved thedark energy at their core the emperor had simply recognized this truth andutilized his own aggrandizement of course 
 for his soul was the black center of the empire 
 he contemplated the dense impenetrability of the deep space beyond the black as his if he were in some real way this blackness as if hisinner spirit was itself this void over which he reigned he smiled at the thought hewas the empire he was the universe 
 behind him he sensed vader still waiting in genuflection how long had thedark lord been there five minutes ten the emperor was uncertain nomatter the emperor had not quite finished his meditation 
 lord vader did not mind waiting though nor was he even aware of it for itwas an honor and a noble activity to kneel at his feet he kept his eyesinward seeking reflection in his own bottomless core his power was great than it had ever been it shimmered from within and resonated with thewaves of darkness that flowed from the emperor he felt engorged with this surged like black fire demon electrons looking for groundbut he would his emperor was not ready and his son was not ready and the time was not he waited 
 finally the chair slowly rotated until the emperor faced vader 
 vader spoke first what is thy bidding my master 
 send the fleet to the far side of endor there it will stay until called for 
 and what of the reports of the rebel fleet massing near sullust 
 it is of no concern soon the rebellion will be crushed and the youngskywalker will be one of us your work here is finished my friend go out to thecommand ship and await my order 
 yes my master he hoped he would be given command over the destructionof the rebel alliance he hoped it would be soon 
 he rose and exited as the emperor turned back to the galactic panorama beyondthe window to view his domain 
 in a remote and midnight vacuum beyond the edge of the galaxy the vast rebelfleet stretched from its vanguard to its rear echelon past the range of human battle ships cruisers destroyers carriers bombers sullustain cargofreighter calamarian tankers alderaanian gunships kesselian blockade skyhoppers and fighters shuttles transportvehicles manowars every rebel in the galaxy soldier and civilian alike waitedtensely in these ships for instructions they were led by the largest of the rebel starcruisers the headquarters frigate 
 hundreds of rebel commanders of all species and lifeforms assembled in thewar room of the giant star cruiser awaiting orders from the high were everywhere and an air of excitement spread from squadron to squadron 
 at the center of the briefing room was a large circular projectedabove which a holographic image of the unfinished imperial death star hoveredbeside the moon of endor whose scintillating protective deflector shieldencompassed them both 
 mon mothma entered the room a stately beautiful woman of middle age sheseemed to walk above the murmurs of the crowd she wore white robes with goldbraiding and her severity was not without she was the elected leader ofthe rebel alliance 
 like adopted palpatine the emperor mothmahad been a senior senator of the republic a member of the high council when therepublic had begun to crumble mon mothma had remained a senator until the dissent stabilizing the increasingly ineffectual government 
 she had organized cells too toward the end pockets of resistance each ofwhich was unaware of the identity of the of which was responsible forinciting revolt against the empire when it finally made itself manifest 
 there had been other leaders but many were killed when the firstdeath star annihilated the planet alderaan adopted father died in thatcalamity 
 mon mothma went underground she joined her political cells with thethousands of guerrillas and insurgents the cruel dictatorship had more joined this rebel alliance mon mothma became theacknowledged leader of all the creatures who had been left homeless by theemperor homeless but not without hope 
 she traversed the room now to the holographic display where she conferredwith her two chief advisors general madine and admiral ackbar madine resourceful if a bit of martinet ackbar was pure creature with huge sad eyes set in a head andwebbed hands that made him more at home in water or free space than on board aship but if the humans were the arm of the rebellion the calamarians were to say they fight with the best when pushed to the the evil empire had reached that limit 
 lando calrissian made his way through the crowd now scanning faces hesaw wedge who was to be his wing nodded at each other gave sign but then lando moved on wedge the one he was lookingfor he made it to a clearing near the center peered around finally saw his friendsstanding by a side door he smiled and wandered over 
 han chewie leia and the two droids greeted appearance with acacophony of cheers laughs beeps and barks 
 well look at you solo chided straightening the lapel of newuniform and pulling on the insignias a general 
 lando laughed affectionately a man of many faces and many must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of from norulac his stint as governor of cloud out the bandits against all odds using legendary flying and unheard ofstrategies and done it on a bet 
 han opened his eyes wide with sarcasm hey look at me i just toldthem you were a fair pilot i had no idea they were looking for someone to leadthis crazy attack 
 all right i asked for it i want to lead this attack for one thing heliked dressing up like a general people gave him the respect he deserved and have to give up flying circles around some pompous imperial militarypoliceman and that was the other was finally going to stick it to thisimperial navy stick it so it hurt for all the times been stuck stick it and leavehis signature on it general calrissian thank you 
 solo looked at his old friend admiration combined with disbelief have youever seen one of those death stars in for a very short generalship oldbuddy 
 surprised they ask you to do it lando smiled 
 maybe they did han intimated but not crazy the respectableone remember of the bespin cloud city 
 leia moved closer to solo and took his arm protectively han is going to stayon the command ship with both very grateful for what and proud 
 suddenly at the center of the room mon mothma signaled for attention theroom fell silent anticipation was keen 
 the data brought to us by the bothan spies have been confirmed the supremeleader announced the empire has made a critical error and the time for our attackhas come 
 this caused a great stir in the room as if her message had been a valve lettingoff pressure the air hissed with comment she turned to the hologram of the deathstar and went on we now have the exact location of the new battlestation the weapon systems on this death star are not yet operational with theimperial fleet spread throughout the galaxy in a vain effort to engage us it isrelatively unprotected she paused here to let her next statement register its fulleffect most important we have learned the emperor himself is personallyoverseeing the construction 
 a volley of spirited chatter erupted from the assembly this was it thechance the hope no one could hope to hope for a shot at the emperor 
 mon mothma continued when the hubbub died down slightly his trip wasundertaken in the utmost secrecy but he underestimated our spy network manybothans died to bring us this information her voice turned suddenly stern again toremind them of the price of this enterprise 
 admiral ackbar stepped forward his specialty was imperial defenseprocedures he raised his fin and pointed at the holographic model of the force fieldemanating from endor although uncompleted the death star is not entirelywithout a defense mechanism he instructed in soothing calamarian tones it isprotected by an energy shield which is generated by the nearby moon of endor ship can fly through it no weapon can penetrate it he stopped for a longmoment he wanted the information to sink in when he thought it had he spokemore slowly the shield must be deactivated if any attack is to be the shield is down the cruisers will create a perimeter while the fighters fly intothe superstructure hereand attempt to hit the main reactor he pointed to theunfinished portion of the death star somewhere in here 
 another murmur swept over the room of commanders like a swell in a heavysea 
 ackbar concluded general calrissian will lead the fighter attack 
 han turned to lando his doubts gilded with respect good luck buddy 
 thanks said lando simply 
 gonna need it 
 admiral ackbar yielded the floor to general madine who was in charge ofcovert operations we have acquired a small imperial shuttle madine declaredsmugly under this guise a strike team will land on the moon and deactivate theshield generator the control bunker is well guarded but a small squad should beable to penetrate its security 
 this news stimulated another round of general mumbling 
 leia turned to han and said under her breath i wonder who they found to pullthat one off 
 madine called out general solo is your strike team assembled 
 leia looked up at han shock quickly melting to joyous admiration she knewthere was a reason she loved spite of his usual crass insensitivity and oafishbravado beneath it all he had heart 
 moreover a change had come over him since he emerged from just a loner selfish edge and had somehow subtly become part of thewhole he was actually doing something for someone else now and that factmoved leia greatly madine had called him general that meant han had let himselfofficially become a member of the army a part of the whole 
 solo responded to madine my squad is ready sir but i need a command crewfor the shuttle he looked questioningly at chewbacca and spoke in a lower gonna be rough old pal i want to speak for you 
 roo roowfl chewbacca shook his head with gruff love and raised his hairypaw 
 one han called 
 two leia shouted sticking her arm in the air then softly to not letting you out of my sight again your generalship 
 and with you too a voice was raised from the back of the room 
 they all turned their heads to see luke standing at the top of the stairs 
 cheers went up for the last of the jedi 
 and though it his style han was unable to conceal his joy he smiled 
 leia ran up to luke and hugged him warmly she felt a special closeness tohim all of a sudden which she attributed to the gravity of the moment the import oftheir mission but then she sensed a change in him too a difference of substancethat seemed to radiate from his very that she alone could see 
 what is it luke she whispered she suddenly wanted to hold him shecould not have said why 
 nothing tell you someday he murmured quietly it was distinctly notnothing though 
 all right she answered not pushing wait she wondered maybehe was just dressed was probably it suited up all in black him look older older that was it 
 han chewie lando wedge and several others crowded around luke all atonce with greetings and diverse sorts of hubbub the assembly as a whole broke upinto multiple such small groups it was a time for last farewells and good graces 
 artoo beeped a singsong little observation to a somewhat less sanguine threepio 
 i think exciting is the right word the golden droid answered being atranslator in his master program of course threepio was most concerned withlocating the right word to describe the present situation 
 the millennium falcon rested in the main docking bay of the rebel star loaded and serviced just beyond it sat the stolen imperial shuttle lookinganomalous in the midst of all the rebel fighters 
 chewie supervised the final transfer of weapons and supplies to the shuttle andoversaw the placement of the strike team han stood with lando between the twoships saying all they knew forever 
 i mean it take her solo insisted indicating the falcon bring youluck you know the fastest ship in the whole fleet now han had reallysouped her up after winning her from lando always been fast but now shewas much faster and the modifications solo added had really made the falcon apart of put his love and sweat into it his spirit so giving her to landonow was truly final selfless a gift as ever given 
 and lando understood thanks old buddy take good care of her youknow i always flew her better than you did anyway she get a scratch on me at the stick 
 solo looked warmly at the endearing rogue got your ascratch 
 take off you thing have me putting down a securitydeposit 
 see you soon pal 
 they parted without their true feelings expressed aloud as was the way betweenmen of deeds in those times each walked up the ramp into a different ship 
 han entered the cockpit of the imperial shuttle as luke was doing some finetuning on a rear navigator panel chewbacca in the seat was trying tofigure out the imperial controls han took the chair and chewbacca growledgrumpily about the design 
 yeah yeah solo answered i think the empire designed it with awookiee in mind 
 leia walked in from the hold taking her seat near luke all set backthere 
 rrrwfr said chewie hitting the first sequence of switches he looked over atsolo but han was motionless staring out the window at something chewie andleia both followed his gaze to the object of his unyielding millenniumfalcon 
 leia gently nudged the pilot hey you awake up there 
 i just got a funny feeling han mused like not going to see her thought of the times saved him with her speed of the times saved withhis cunning or his touch he thought of the universe seen together of theshelter given him of the way he knew her inside and out of the times in each embrace floating still as a quiet dream in the black silence ofdeep space 
 chewbacca hearing this took his own longing look at the falcon leia put herhand on shoulder she knew he had special love for his ship and wasreluctant to interrupt this last communion but time was dear and becoming on captain she whispered move 
 han snapped back to the moment right okay chewie find out whatthis baby can do 
 they fired up the engines in the stolen shuttle eased out of the docking bay andbanked off into the endless night 
 construction on the death star proceeded traffic in the area was thick withtransport ships tie fighters and equipment shuttles periodically the super stardestroyer orbited the area surveying progress on the space station from every angle 
 the bridge of the star destroyer was a hive of activity messengers ran backand forth along a string of controllers studying their tracking screens monitoringingress and egress of vehicles through the deflector shield codes were sent andreceived orders given diagrams plotted it was an operation involving a thousandscurrying ships and everything was proceeding with maximum efficiency untilcontroller jhoff made the shield from sector seven 
 shuttle to control please come in the voice broke into headset withthe normal amount of static 
 we have you on our screen now the controller replied into his identify 
 this is shuttle tydirium requesting deactivation of the deflector shield 
 shuttle tydirium transmit the clearance code for shield passage 
 up in the shuttle han threw a worried look at the others and said into hiscomlink transmission commencing 
 chewie flipped a bank of switches producing a syncopated series transmission noises 
 leia bit her lip bracing herself for fight or flight now we find out if thatcode was worth the price we paid 
 chewie whined nervously 
 luke stared at the huge super star destroyer that loomed everywhere in front ofthem it fixed his eye with its glittering darkness filled his vision like a it made more than his vision opaque it filled his mind with and his heart black fear and a special knowing vader is on that ship hewhispered 
 jittery luke han reassured them all there are lots of commandships but chewie he cautioned keep our distance without looking keeping our distance 
 awroff rwrgh rrfrough 
 i casual han barked back 
 taking a long time with that code clearance leia said tightly whatif it work the alliance could do nothing if the deflector shieldremained functioning leia tried to clear her mind tried to focus on the shieldgenerator she wanted to reach tried to weed away all feelings of doubt or fear shemay have been giving off 
 endangering the mission luke spoke now in a kind of emotionalresonance with his secret sister his thoughts were of vader though their have come 
 han tried to buoy things up hey why we try to be optimistic aboutthis he felt beleaguered by negativity 
 he knows here luke avowed he kept staring at the command ship outthe it seemed to taunt him it awaited 
 come on kid imagining things 
 ararh gragh chewie mumbled even he was grim 
 lord vader stood quite still staring out a large at the death thrilled to the sight of this monument to the dark side of the force icily hecaressed it with his gaze 
 like a floating ornament it sparkled for him a magic globe tiny specks oflight raced across its surface mesmerizing the dark lord as if he were a small childentranced by a special toy it was a transcendant state he was inn a moment ofheightened perceptions 
 and then all at once in the midst of the stillness of his contemplation he grewabsolutely motionless not a breath not even a heartbeat stirred to mar hisconcentration he strained his every sense into the ether what had he felt hisspirit tilted its head to listen some echo some vibration apprehended only by had not passed had swirled the moment and altered the very shapeof things things were no longer the same 
 he walked down the row of controllers until he came to the spot where admiralpiett was leaning over the tracking screen of controller jhoff piett straightened approach then bowed stiffly at the neck 
 where is that shuttle going vader demanded quietly without preliminary 
 piett turned back to the and spoke into the comlink shuttletydirium what is your cargo and destination 
 the filtered voice of the shuttle pilot came back over the receiver parts andtechnical personnel for the sanctuary moon 
 the bridge commander looked to vader for a reaction he hoped nothing wasamiss lord vader did not take mistakes lightly 
 do they have a code clearance vader questioned 
 an older code but it checks out piett replied immediately i was aboutto clear them there was no point in lying to the lord of the sith he alwaysknew if you lied lies sang out to the dark lord 
 i have a strange feeling about that ship vader said more to himself than toanyone else 
 should i hold them piett hurried anxious to please his master 
 no let them pass i will deal with this myself 
 as you wish my lord piett bowed partly to hide his surprise he nodded atcontroller jhoff who spoke into the comlink to shuttle tydirium 
 in the shuttle tydirium the group waited tensely the more questions theywere asked about things like cargo and destination the more likely it seemed theywere going to blow their cover 
 han looked fondly at his old wookiee partner chewie if they go forthis gonna have to beat it quick it was a speech really they allknew this pokey shuttle about to outrun anything in the neighborhood 
 the static voice of the controller broke up and then came in clearly over thecomlink shuttle tydirium deactivation of the shield will commence your present course 
 everyone but luke exhaled in simultaneous relief as if the trouble were all overnow instead of just beginning luke continued to stare at the command ship as ifengaged in some silent complex dialogue 
 chewie barked loudly 
 hey what did i tell you han grinned no sweat 
 leia smiled affectionately is that what you told us 
 solo pushed the throttle forward and the stolen shuttle moved smoothly towardthe green sanctuary moon 
 vader piett and jhoff watched the in the control room as theweblike deflector grid readout parted to admit the shuttle tydirium which movedslowly toward the center of the endor 
 vader turned to the deck officer and spoke with more urgency in his voice thanwas usually heard ready my shuttle i must go to the emperor 
 without waiting for response the dark lord strode off clearly in the thrall of adark thought

 book two 
 chapter v 
 
 that same evening there was an animated discussion among the officers in quarters 
 and i tell you rostov that you must apologize to the colonel said a tall staff captain with enormous mustaches and many wrinkles on his large features to rostov who was crimson with excitement 
 the staff captain kirsten had twice been reduced to the ranks for affairs of honor and had twice regained his commission 
 i will allow no one to call me a liar cried rostov he told me i lied and i told him he lied and there it rests he may keep me on duty every day or may place me under arrest but no one can make me apologize because if he as commander of this regiment thinks it beneath his dignity to give me satisfaction then 
 you just wait a moment my dear fellow and listen interrupted the staff captain in his deep bass calmly stroking his long mustache you tell the colonel in the presence of other officers that an officer has stolen 
 not to blame that the conversation began in the presence of other officers perhaps i ought not to have spoken before them but i am not a diplomatist why i joined the hussars thinking that here one would not need finesse and he tells me that i am lying so let him give me satisfaction 
 all right no one thinks you a coward but not the point ask denisov whether it is not out of the question for a cadet to demand satisfaction of his regimental commander 
 denisov sat gloomily biting his mustache and listening to the conversation evidently with no wish to take part in it he answered the staff question by a disapproving shake of his head 
 you speak to the colonel about this nasty business before other officers continued the staff captain and bogdanich the colonel was called bogdanich shuts you up 
 he did not shut me up he said i was telling an untruth 
 well have it so and you talked a lot of nonsense to him and must apologize 
 not on any account exclaimed rostov 
 i did not expect this of you said the staff captain seriously and severely you wish to apologize but man not only to him but to the whole regiment all of us to blame all round the case is this you ought to have thought the matter over and taken advice but no you go and blurt it all straight out before the officers now what was the colonel to do have the officer tried and disgrace the whole regiment disgrace the whole regiment because of one scoundrel is that how you look at it we see it like that and bogdanich was a brick he told you you were saying what was not true not pleasant but to be done my dear fellow you landed yourself in it and now when one wants to smooth the thing over some conceit prevents your apologizing and you wish to make the whole affair public you are offended at being put on duty a bit but why not apologize to an old and honorable officer whatever bogdanich may be anyway he is an honorable and brave old colonel quick at taking offense but you mind disgracing the whole regiment the staff voice began to tremble you have been in the regiment next to no time my lad here today and tomorrow be appointed adjutant somewhere and can snap your fingers when it is said there are thieves among the pavlograd officers but not all the same to us am i not right denisov not the same 
 denisov remained silent and did not move but occasionally looked with his glittering black eyes at rostov 
 you value your own pride and wish to apologize continued the staff captain but we old fellows who have grown up in and god willing are going to die in the regiment we prize the honor of the regiment and bogdanich knows it oh we do prize it old fellow and all this is not right not right you may take offense or not but i always stick to mother truth not right 
 and the staff captain rose and turned away from rostov 
 twue devil take it shouted denisov jumping up now then wostov now then 
 rostov growing red and pale alternately looked first at one officer and then at the other 
 no gentlemen no you think i quite understand wrong to think that of me i for me for the honor of the regiment ah well show that in action and for me the honor of the flag well never mind true to blame to blame all round well what else do you want 
 come right count cried the staff captain turning round and clapping rostov on the shoulder with his big hand 
 i tell you shouted denisov a fine fellow 
 better count said the staff captain beginning to address rostov by his title as if in recognition of his confession go and apologize your excellency yes go 
 gentlemen do anything no one shall hear a word from me said rostov in an imploring voice but i apologize by god i do what you will how can i go and apologize like a little boy asking forgiveness 
 denisov began to laugh 
 be worse for you bogdanich is vindictive and pay for your obstinacy said kirsten 
 no on my word not obstinacy i describe the feeling i 
 well as you like said the staff captain and what has become of that scoundrel he asked denisov 
 he has weported himself sick to be stwuck off the list tomowwow muttered denisov 
 it is an illness no other way of explaining it said the staff captain 
 illness or not better not cwoss my path kill him shouted denisov in a bloodthirsty tone 
 just then zherkov entered the room 
 what brings you here cried the officers turning to the newcomer 
 to go into action gentlemen mack has surrendered with his whole army 
 not true 
 seen him myself 
 what saw the real mack with hands and feet 
 into action into action bring him a bottle for such news but how did you come here 
 been sent back to the regiment all on account of that devil mack an austrian general complained of me i congratulated him on arrival the matter rostov you look as if just come out of a hot bath 
 oh my dear fellow in such a stew here these last two days

 chapter 
 
 on the morrow of that monday earnshaw being still unable to follow his ordinary employments and therefore remaining about the house i speedily found it would be impracticable to retain my charge beside me as heretofore she got downstairs before me and out into the garden where she had seen her cousin performing some easy work and when i went to bid them come to breakfast i saw she had persuaded him to clear a large space of ground from currant and gooseberry bushes and they were busy planning together an importation of plants from the grange 
 i was terrified at the devastation which had been accomplished in a brief the trees were the apple of eye and she had just fixed her choice of a flower bed in the midst of them 
 there that will be all shown to the master i exclaimed the minute it is discovered and what excuse have you to offer for taking such liberties with the garden we shall have a fine explosion on the head of it see if we mr hareton i wonder you should have no more wit than to go and make that mess at her bidding 
 forgotten they were answered earnshaw rather puzzled but tell him i did it 
 we always ate our meals with mr heathcliff i held the post in making tea and carving so i was indispensable at table catherine usually sat by me but today she stole nearer to hareton and i presently saw she would have no more discretion in her friendship than she had in her hostility 
 now mind you talk with and notice your cousin too much were my whispered instructions as we entered the room it will certainly annoy mr heathcliff and be mad at you both 
 not going to she answered 
 the minute after she had sidled to him and was sticking primroses in his plate of porridge 
 he dared not speak to her there he dared hardly look and yet she went on teasing till he was twice on the point of being provoked to laugh and i frowned and then she glanced towards the master whose mind was occupied on other subjects than his company as his countenance evinced and she grew serious for an instant scrutinizing him with deep gravity afterwards she turned and recommenced her nonsense at last hareton uttered a smothered laugh mr heathcliff started his eye rapidly surveyed our faces catherine met it with her accustomed look of nervousness and yet defiance which he abhorred 
 it is well you are out of my reach he exclaimed what fiend possesses you to stare back at me continually with those infernal eyes down with them and remind me of your existence again i thought i had cured you of laughing 
 it was me muttered hareton what do you say demanded the master 
 hareton looked at his plate and did not repeat the confession mr heathcliff looked at him a bit and then silently resumed his breakfast and his interrupted musing we had nearly finished and the two young people prudently shifted wider asunder so i anticipated no further disturbance during that sitting when joseph appeared at the door revealing by his quivering lip and furious eyes that the outrage committed on his precious shrubs was detected he must have seen cathy and her cousin about the spot before he examined it for while his jaws worked like those of a cow chewing its cud and rendered his speech difficult to understand he began 
 aw mun hev my wage and aw mun goa aw bed aimed tuh dee wheare sarved fur sixty year un aw thowt lug my books up intuh t garret un all my bits uh stuff un they sud hev t kitchen tuh theirseln fur t sake uh quietness it wur hard tuh gie up my awn hearthstun bud aw thowt aw could do that bud nah taan my garden frough me un by th heart maister aw cannot stand it yah muh bend tuh th yoak an ye will aw noan used to t and an man sooin get used tuh new barthens rayther arn my bite an my sup wi a hammer in th road 
 now now idiot interrupted heathcliff cut it short your grievance interfere in no quarrels between you and nelly she may thrust you into the for anything i care 
 noan nelly answered joseph aw shift fur ill nowt as shoo is thank god shoo cannot stale t sowl o shoo wer niver soa handsome bud whet a body mud look at her baht winking yon flaysome graceless quean ut s witched ahr lad wi her bold een un her forrard it fair brusts my heart forgetten all ee done for him un made on him un goan un riven up a whole row ut t grandest currant trees i t garden and here he lamented outright unmanned by a sense of his bitter injuries and ingratitude and dangerous condition 
 is the fool drunk asked mr heathcliff hareton is it you finding fault with 
 pulled up two or three bushes replied the young man but going to set em again 
 and why have you pulled them up said the master catherine unwisely put in her tongue 
 we wanted to plant some flowers there she cried the only person to blame for i wished him to do it 
 and who the devil gave you leave to touch a stick about the place demanded her much surprised and who ordered you to obey her he added turning to hareton 
 the latter was speechless his cousin replied 
 you grudge a few yards of earth for me to ornament when you have taken all my land 
 your land insolent slut you never had any said heathcliff 
 and my money she continued returning his angry glare and meantime biting a piece of crust the remnant of her breakfast 
 silence he exclaimed get done and begone 
 and land and his money pursued the reckless thing hareton and i are friends now and i shall tell him all about you 
 the master seemed confounded a moment he grew pale and rose up eyeing her all the while with an expression of mortal hate 
 if you strike me hareton will strike you she said so you may as well sit down 
 if hareton does not turn you out of the room strike him to hell thundered heathcliff damnable witch dare you pretend to rouse him against me off with her do you hear fling her into the kitchen kill her ellen dean if you let her come into my sight again 
 hareton tried under his breath to persuade her to go 
 drag her away he cried savagely are you staying to talk and he approached to execute his own command 
 not obey you wicked man any more said catherine and soon detest you as much as i do 
 wisht wisht muttered the young man reproachfully i will not hear you speak so to him have done 
 but you let him strike me she cried come then he whispered earnestly it was too late heathcliff had caught hold of her 
 now you go he said to earnshaw accursed witch this time she has provoked me when i could not bear it and make her repent it for ever 
 he had his hand in her hair hareton attempted to release the locks entreating him not to hurt her that once black eyes flashed he seemed ready to tear catherine in pieces and i was just worked up to risk coming to the rescue when of a sudden his fingers relaxed he shifted his grasp from her head to her arm and gazed intently in her face then he drew his hand over his eyes stood a moment to collect himself apparently and turning anew to catherine said with assumed calmness you must learn to avoid putting me in a passion or i shall really murder you some time go with mrs dean and keep with her and confine your insolence to her ears as to hareton earnshaw if i see him listen to you send him seeking his bread where he can get it your love will make him an outcast and a beggar nelly take her and leave me all of you leave me 
 i led my young lady out she was too glad of her escape to resist the other followed and mr heathcliff had the room to himself till dinner i had counselled catherine to get hers upstairs but as soon as he perceived her vacant seat he sent me to call her he spoke to none of us ate very little and went out directly afterwards intimating that he should not return before evening 
 the two new friends established themselves in the house during his absence when i heard hareton sternly check his cousin on her offering a revelation of her conduct to his father he said he suffer a word to be uttered to him in his disparagement if he were the devil it signify he would stand by him and rather she would abuse himself as she used to than begin on mr heathcliff catherine was waxing cross at this but he found means to make her hold her tongue by asking how she would like him to speak ill of her father and then she comprehended that earnshaw took the reputation home to himself and was attached by ties stronger than reason could forged by habit which it would be cruel to attempt to loosen she showed a good heart thenceforth in avoiding both complaints and expressions of antipathy concerning heathcliff and confessed to me her sorrow that she had endeavoured to raise a bad spirit between him and hareton indeed i believe she has ever breathed a syllable in the hearing against her oppressor since 
 when this slight disagreement was over they were thick again and as busy as possible in their several occupations of pupil and teacher i came in to sit with them after i had done my work and i felt so soothed and comforted to watch them that i did not notice how time got on you know they both appeared in a measure my children i had long been proud of one and now i was sure the other would be a source of equal satisfaction his honest warm and intelligent nature shook off rapidly the clouds of ignorance and degradation in which it had been bred and sincere commendations acted as a spur to his industry his brightening mind brightened his features and added spirit and nobility to their aspect i could hardly fancy it the same individual i had beheld on the day i discovered my little lady at wuthering heights after her expedition to the crags while i admired and they laboured dusk grew on and with it returned the master he came upon us quite unexpectedly entering by the front way and had a full view of the whole three ere we could raise our heads to glance at him well i reflected there was never a pleasanter or more harmless sight and it will be a burning shame to scold them the red firelight glowed on their two bonny heads and revealed their faces animated with the eager interest of children he was and she eighteen each had so much of novelty to feel and learn that neither experienced nor evinced the sentiments of sober disenchanted maturity 
 they lifted their eyes together to encounter mr heathcliff perhaps you have never remarked that their eyes are precisely similar and they are those of catherine earnshaw the present catherine has no other likeness to her except a breadth of forehead and a certain arch of the nostril that makes her appear rather haughty whether she will or not with hareton the resemblance is carried further it is singular at all times then it was particularly striking because his senses were alert and his mental faculties wakened to unwonted activity i suppose this resemblance disarmed mr heathcliff he walked to the hearth in evident agitation but it quickly subsided as he looked at the young man or i should say altered its character for it was there yet he took the book from his hand and glanced at the open page then returned it without any observation merely signing catherine away her companion lingered very little behind her and i was about to depart also but he bid me sit still 
 it is a poor conclusion is it not he observed having brooded a while on the scene he had just witnessed an absurd termination to my violent exertions i get levers and mattocks to demolish the two houses and train myself to be capable of working like hercules and when everything is ready and in my power i find the will to lift a slate off either roof has vanished my old enemies have not beaten me now would be the precise time to revenge myself on their representatives i could do it and none could hinder me but where is the use i care for striking i take the trouble to raise my hand that sounds as if i had been labouring the whole time only to exhibit a fine trait of magnanimity it is far from being the case i have lost the faculty of enjoying their destruction and i am too idle to destroy for nothing 
 nelly there is a strange change approaching in its shadow at present i take so little interest in my daily life that i hardly remember to eat and drink those two who have left the room are the only objects which retain a distinct material appearance to me and that appearance causes me pain amounting to agony about her i speak and i desire to think but i earnestly wish she were invisible her presence invokes only maddening sensations he moves me differently and yet if i could do it without seeming insane never see him again perhaps think me rather inclined to become so he added making an effort to smile if i try to describe the thousand forms of past associations and ideas he awakens or embodies but not talk of what i tell you and my mind is so eternally secluded in itself it is tempting at last to turn it out to another 
 five minutes ago hareton seemed a personification of my youth not a human being i felt to him in such a variety of ways that it would have been impossible to have accosted him rationally in the first place his startling likeness to catherine connected him fearfully with her that however which you may suppose the most potent to arrest my imagination is actually the least for what is not connected with her to me and what does not recall her i cannot look down to this floor but her features are shaped in the flags in every cloud in every the air at night and caught by glimpses in every object by am surrounded with her image the most ordinary faces of men and own me with a resemblance the entire world is a dreadful collection of memoranda that she did exist and that i have lost her well aspect was the ghost of my immortal love of my wild endeavours to hold my right my degradation my pride my happiness and my anguish 
 but it is frenzy to repeat these thoughts to you only it will let you know why with a reluctance to be always alone his society is no benefit rather an aggravation of the constant torment i suffer and it partly contributes to render me regardless how he and his cousin go on together i can give them no attention any more 
 but what do you mean by a change mr heathcliff i said alarmed at his manner though he was neither in danger of losing his senses nor dying according to my judgment he was quite strong and healthy and as to his reason from childhood he had a delight in dwelling on dark things and entertaining odd fancies he might have had a monomania on the subject of his departed idol but on every other point his wits were as sound as mine 
 i shall not know that till it comes he said only half conscious of it now 
 you have no feelings of illness have you i asked 
 no nelly i have not he answered 
 then you are not afraid of death i pursued 
 afraid no he replied i have neither a fear nor a presentiment nor a hope of death why should i with my hard constitution and temperate mode of living and unperilous occupations i ought to and probably shall remain above ground till there is scarcely a black hair on my head and yet i cannot continue in this condition i have to remind myself to to remind my heart to beat and it is like bending back a stiff spring it is by compulsion that i do the slightest act not prompted by one thought and by compulsion that i notice anything alive or dead which is not associated with one universal idea i have a single wish and my whole being and faculties are yearning to attain it they have yearned towards it so long and so unwaveringly that convinced it will be it has devoured my existence i am swallowed up in the anticipation of its fulfilment my confessions have not relieved me but they may account for some otherwise unaccountable phases of humour which i show o god it is a long fight i wish it were over 
 he began to pace the room muttering terrible things to himself till i was inclined to believe as he said joseph did that conscience had turned his heart to an earthly hell i wondered greatly how it would end though he seldom before had revealed this state of mind even by looks it was his habitual mood i had no doubt he asserted it himself but not a soul from his general bearing would have conjectured the fact you did not when you saw him mr lockwood and at the period of which i speak he was just the same as then only fonder of continued solitude and perhaps still more laconic in company

 chapter 
 
 new york november 
 dear marmee and beth 
 going to write you a regular volume for got heaps to tell though not a fine young lady traveling on the continent when i lost sight of dear old face i felt a trifle blue and might have shed a briny drop or two if an irish lady with four small children all crying more or less diverted my mind for i amused myself by dropping gingerbread nuts over the seat every time they opened their mouths to roar 
 soon the sun came out and taking it as a good omen i cleared up likewise and enjoyed my journey with all my heart 
 mrs kirke welcomed me so kindly i felt at home at once even in that big house full of strangers she gave me a funny little sky she had but there is a stove in it and a nice table in a sunny window so i can sit here and write whenever i like a fine view and a church tower opposite atone for the many stairs and i took a fancy to my den on the spot the nursery where i am to teach and sew is a pleasant room next mrs private parlor and the two little girls are pretty children rather spoiled i fancy but they took to me after telling them the seven bad pigs and no doubt i shall make a model governess 
 i am to have my meals with the children if i prefer it to the great table and for the present i do for i am bashful though no one will believe it 
 now my dear make yourself at home said mrs k in her motherly way on the drive from morning to night as you may suppose with such a family but a great anxiety will be off my mind if i know the children are safe with you my rooms are always open to you and your own shall be as comfortable as i can make it there are some pleasant people in the house if you feel sociable and your evenings are always free come to me if anything goes wrong and be as happy as you can the tea bell i must run and change my cap and off she bustled leaving me to settle myself in my new nest 
 as i went downstairs soon after i saw something i liked the flights are very long in this tall house and as i stood waiting at the head of the third one for a little servant girl to lumber up i saw a gentleman come along behind her take theheavy hod of coal out of her hand carry it all the way up put it down at a door near by and walk away saying with a kind nod and a foreign accent it goes better so the little back is too young to haf such heaviness 
 it good of him i like such things for as father says trifles show character when i mentioned it to mrs k that evening she laughed and said that must have been professor bhaer always doing things of that sort 
 mrs k told me he was from berlin very learned and good but poor as a church mouse and gives lessons to support himself and two little orphan nephews whom he is educating here according to the wishes of his sister who married an american not a very romantic story but it interested me and i was glad to hear that mrs k lends him her parlor for some of his scholars there is a glass door between it and the nursery and i mean to peep at him and then tell you how he looks almost forty so no harm marmee 
 after tea and a romp with the little girls i attacked the big workbasket and had a quiet evening chatting with my new friend i shall keep a and send it once a week so goodnight and more tomorrow 
 
 tuesday eve 
 
 
 had a lively time in my seminary this morning for the children acted like sancho and at one time i really thought i should shake them all round some good angel inspired me to try gymnastics and i kept it up till they were glad to sit down and keep still after luncheon the girl took them out for a walk and i went to my needlework like little mabel with a willing mind i was thanking my stars that learned to make nice buttonholes when the parlor door opened and shut and someone began to hum kennst du das land like a big bumblebee it was dreadfully improper i know but i resist the temptation and lifting one end of the curtain before the glass door i peeped in professor bhaer was there and while he arranged his books i took a good look at him a regular stout with brown hair tumbled all over his head a bushy beard good nose the kindest eyes i ever saw and a splendid big voice that does ears good after our sharp or slipshod american gabble his clothes were rusty his hands were large and he a really handsome feature in his face except his beautiful teeth yet i liked him for he had a fine head his linen was very nice and he looked like a gentleman though two buttons were off his coat and there was a patch on one shoe he looked sober in spite of his humming till he went to the window to turn the hyacinth bulbs toward the sun and stroke the cat who received him like an old friend then he smiled and when a tap came at the door called out in a loud brisk tone herein 
 i was just going to run when i caught sight of a morsel of a child carrying a big book and stopped to see what was going on 
 me wants me bhaer said the mite slamming down her book and running to meet him 
 thou shalt haf thy bhaer come then and take a goot hug from him my tina said the professor catching her up with a laugh and holding her so high over his head that she had to stoop her little face to kiss him 
 now me mus tuddy my lessin went on the funny little thing so he put her up at the table opened the great dictionary she had brought and gave her a paper and pencil and she scribbled away turning a leaf now and then and passing her little fat finger down the page as if finding a word so soberly that i nearly betrayed myself by a laugh while mr bhaer stood stroking her pretty hair with a fatherly look that made me think she must be his own though she looked more french than german 
 another knock and the appearance of two young ladies sent me back to my work and there i virtuously remained through all the noise and gabbling that went on next door one of the girls kept laughing affectedly and saying now professor in a coquettish tone and the other pronounced her german with an accent that must have made it hard for him to keep sober 
 both seemed to try his patience sorely for more than once i heard him say emphatically no no it is not so you haf not attend to what i say and once there was a loud rap as if he struck the table with his book followed by the despairing exclamation prut it all goes bad this day 
 poor man i pitied him and when the girls were gone took just one more peep to see if he survived it he seemed to have thrown himself back in his chair tired out and sat there with his eyes shut till the clock struck two when he jumped up put his books in his pocket as if ready for another lesson and taking little tina who had fallen asleep on the sofa in his arms he carried her quietly away i fancy he has a hard life of it mrs kirke asked me if i go down to the five dinner and feeling a little bit homesick i thought i would just to see what sort of people are under the same roof with me so i made myself respectable and tried to slip in behind mrs kirke but as she is short and tall my efforts at concealment were rather a failure she gave me a seat by her and after my face cooled off i plucked up courage and looked about me the long table was full and every one intent on getting their dinner the gentlemen especially who seemed to be eating on time for they bolted in every sense of the word vanishing as soon as they were done there was the usual assortment of young men absorbed in themselves young couples absorbed in each other married ladies in their babies and old gentlemen in politics i think i shall care to have much to do with any of them except one sweetfaced maiden lady who looks as if she had something in her 
 cast away at the very bottom of the table was the professor shouting answers to the questions of a very inquisitive deaf old gentleman on one side and talking philosophy with a frenchman on the other if amy had been here have turned her back on him forever because sad to relate he had a great appetite and shoveled in his dinner in a manner which would have horrified her ladyship i mind for i like to see folks eat with a relish as hannah says and the poor man must have needed a deal of food after teaching idiots all day 
 as i went upstairs after dinner two of the young men were settling their hats before the hall mirror and i heard one say low to the other the new party 
 governess or something of that sort 
 what the deuce is she at our table for 
 friend of the old 
 handsome head but no style 
 not a bit of it give us a light and come on 
 i felt angry at first and then i care for a governess is as good as a clerk and got sense if i style which is more than some people have judging from the remarks of the elegant beings who clattered away smoking like bad chimneys i hate ordinary people 
 
 thursday 
 
 yesterday was a quiet day spent in teaching sewing and writing in my little room which is very cozy with a light and fire i picked up a few bits of news and was introduced to the professor it seems that tina is the child of the frenchwoman who does the fine ironing in the laundry here the little thing has lost her heart to mr bhaer and follows him about the house like a dog whenever he is at home which delights him as he is very fond of children though a bacheldore kitty and minnie kirk likewise regard him with affection and tell all sorts of stories about the plays he invents the presents he brings and the splendid tales he tells the younger men quiz him it seems call him old fritz lager beer ursa major and make all manner of jokes on his name but he enjoys it like a boy mrs kirke says and takes it so that they all like him in spite of his foreign ways 
 the maiden lady is a miss norton rich cultivated and kind she spoke to me at dinner today for i went to table again such fun to watch people and asked me to come and see her at her room she has fine books and pictures knows interesting persons and seems friendly so i shall make myself agreeable for i do want to get into good society only it the same sort that amy likes 
 i was in our parlor last evening when mr bhaer came in with some newspapers for mrs kirke she there but minnie who is a little old woman introduced me very prettily this is friend miss march 
 yes and jolly and we like her lots added kitty who is and enfant terrible 
 we both bowed and then we laughed for the prim introduction and the blunt addition were rather a comical contrast 
 ah yes i hear these naughty ones go to vex you mees marsch if so again call at me and i come he said with a threatening frown that delighted the little wretches 
 i promised i would and he departed but it seems as if i was doomed to see a good deal of him for today as i passed his door on my way out by accident i knocked against it with my umbrella it flew open and there he stood in his dressing gown with a big blue sock on one hand and a darning needle in the other he seem at all ashamed of it for when i explained and hurried on he waved his hand sock and all saying in his loud cheerful way 
 you haf a fine day to make your walk bon voyage mademoiselle 
 i laughed all the way downstairs but it was a little pathetic also to think of the poor man having to mend his own clothes the german gentlemen embroider i know but darning hose is another thing and not so pretty 
 nothing has happened to write about except a call on miss norton who has a room full of pretty things and who was very charming for she showed me all her treasures and asked me if i would sometimes go with her to lectures and concerts as her escort if i enjoyed them she put it as a favor but sure mrs kirke has told her about us and she does it out of kindness to me as proud as lucifer but such favors from such people burden me and i accepted gratefully when i got back to the nursery there was such an uproar in the parlor that i looked in and there was mr bhaer down on his hands and knees with tina on his back kitty leading him with a jump rope and minnie feeding two small boys with seedcakes as they roared and ramped in cages built of chairs 
 we are playing nargerie explained kitty 
 dis is mine effalunt added tina holding on by the hair 
 mamma always allows us to do what we like saturday afternoon when franz and emil come she mr bhaer said minnie 
 the effalunt sat up looking as much in earnest as any of them and said soberly to me i gif you my wort it is so if we make too large a noise you shall say hush to us and we go more softly 
 i promised to do so but left the door open and enjoyed the fun as much as they did for a more glorious frolic i never witnessed they played tag and soldiers danced and sang and when it began to grow dark they all piled onto the sofa about the professor while he told charming fairy stories of the storks on the chimney tops and the little koblods who ride the snowflakes as they fall i wish americans were as simple and natural as germans you 
 so fond of writing i should go spinning on forever if motives of economy stop me for though used thin paper and written fine i tremble to think of the stamps this long letter will need pray forward as soon as you can spare them my small news will sound very flat after her splendors but you will like them i know is teddy studying so hard that he find time to write to his friends take good care of him for me beth and tell me all about the babies and give heaps of love to everyone from your faithful jo 
 on reading over my letter it strikes me as rather bhaery but i am always interested in odd people and i really had nothing else to write about bless you 
 
 december 
 
 my precious betsey 
 as this is to be a letter i direct it to you for it may amuse you and give you some idea of my goings on for though quiet they are rather amusing for which oh be joyful after what amy would call herculaneum efforts in the way of mental and moral agriculture my young ideas begin to shoot and my little twigs to bend as i could wish they are not so interesting tome as tina and the boys but i do my duty by them and they are fond of me franz and emil are jolly little lads quite after my own heart for the mixture of german and american spirit in the produces a constant state of effervescence saturday afternoons are riotous times whether spent in the house or out for on pleasant days they all go to walk like a seminary with the professor and myself to keep order and then such fun 
 we are very good friends now and begun to take lessons i really help it and it all came about in such a droll way that i must tell you to begin at the beginning mrs kirke called to me one day as i passed mr room where she was rummaging 
 did you ever see such a den my dear just come and help me put these books to rights for turned everything upside down trying to discover what he has done with the six new handkerchiefs i gave him not long ago 
 i went in and while we worked i looked about me for it was a den to be sure books and papers everywhere a broken meerschaum and an old flute over the mantlepiece as if done with a ragged bird without any tail chirped on one window seat and a box of white mice adorned the other boats and bits of string lay among the manuscripts dirty little boots stood drying before the fire and traces of the dearly beloved boys for whom he makes a slave of himself were to be seen all over the room after a grand rummage three of the missing articles were found one over the bird cage one covered with ink and a third burned brown having been used as a holder 
 such a man laughed mrs k as she put the relics in the rag bay i suppose the others are torn up to rig ships bandage cut fingers or make kite tails dreadful but i scold him so and goodnatured he lets those boys ride over him roughshod i agreed to do his washing and mending but he forgets to give out his things and i forget to look them over so he comes to a sad pass sometimes 
 let me mend them said i i mind it and he know like to so kind to me about bringing my letters and lending books 
 so i have got his things in order and knit heels into two pairs of the socks for they were boggled out of shape with his queer darns nothing was said and i hoped he find it out but one day last week he caught me at it hearing the lessons he gives to others has interested and amused me so much that i took a fancy to lear for tina runs in and out leaving the door open and i can hear i had been sitting near this door finishing off the last sock and trying to understand what he said to a new scholar who is as stupid as i am the girl had gone and i thought he had also it was so still and i was busily gabbling over a verb and rocking to and fro in a most absurd way when a little crow made me look up and there was mr bhaer looking and laughing quietly while he made signs to tina not to betray him 
 so he said as i stopped and stared like a goose you peep at me i peep at you and this is not bad but see i am not pleasanting when i say haf you a wish for german 
 yes but you are too busy i am too stupid to learn i blundered out as red as a peony 
 prut we will make the time and we fail not to find the sense at efening i shall gif a little lesson with much gladness for look you mees marsch i haf this debt to pay and he pointed to my work yes they say to one another these so kind ladies he is a stupid old fellow he will see not what we do he will never observe that his sock heels go not in holes any more he will think his buttons grow out new when they fall and believe that strings make theirselves ah but i haf an eye and i see much i haf a heart and i feel thanks for this come a little lesson then and now or no more good fairy works for me and mine 
 of course i say anything after that and as it really is a splendid opportunity i made the bargain and we began i took four lessons and then i stuck fast in a grammatical bog the professor was very patient with me but it must have been torment to him and now and then look at me with such an expression of mild despair that it was a with me whether to laugh or cry i tried both ways and when it came to a sniff or utter mortification and woe he just threw the grammar on to the floor and marched out of the room i felt myself disgraced and deserted forever but blame him a particle and was scrambling my papers together meaning to rush upstairs and shake myself hard when in he came as brisk and beaming as if covered myself in glory 
 now we shall try a new way you and i will read these pleasant little marchen together and dig no more in that dry book that goes in the corner for making us trouble 
 he spoke so kindly and opened hans fairy tales so invitingly before me that i was more ashamed than ever and went at my lesson in a style that seemed to amuse him immensely i forgot my bashfulness and pegged away no other word will express it with all my might tumbling over long words pronouncing according to inspiration of the minute and doing my very best when i finished reading my first page and stopped for breath he clapped his hands and cried out in his hearty way das ist gut now we go well my turn i do him in german gif me your ear and away he went rumbling out the words with his strong voice and a relish which was good to see as well as hear fortunately the story was the constant tin soldier which is droll you know so i could laugh and i did though i understand half he read for i help it he was so earnest i so excited and the whole thing so comical 
 after that we got on better and now i read my lessons pretty well for this way of studying suits me and i can see that the grammar gets tucked into the tales and poetry as one gives pills in jelly i like it very much and he seem tired of it yet which is very good of him it i mean to give him something on christmas for i dare not offer money tell me something nice marmee 
 glad laurie seems so happy and busy that he has given up smoking and lets his hair grow you see beth manages him better than i did not jealous dear do your best only make a saint of him afraid i like him without a spice of human naughtiness read him bits of my letters i time to write much and that will do just as well thank heaven beth continues so comfortable

 a happy new year to you all my dearest family which of course includes mr l and a young man by the name of teddy i tell you how much i enjoyed your christmas bundle for i get it till night and had given up hoping your letter came in the morning but you said nothing about a parcel meaning it for a surprise so i was disappointed for had a kind of feeling that you forget me i felt a little low in my mind as i sat up in my room after tea and when the big muddy bundle was brought to me i just hugged it and pranced it was so homey and refreshing that i sat down on the floor and read and looked and ate and laughed and cried in my usual absurd way the things were just what i wanted and all the better for being made instead of bought new ink bib was capital and box of hard gingerbread will be a treasure be sure and wear the nice flannels you sent marmee and read carefully the books father has marked thank you all heaps and heaps 
 speaking of books reminds me that getting rich in that line for on new day mr bhaer gave me a fine shakespeare it is one he values much and often admired it set up in the place of honor with his german bible plato homer and milton so you may imagine how i felt when he brought it down without its cover and showed me my own name in it from my friend friedrich bhaer 
 you say often you wish a library here i gif you one for between these lids he meant covers is many books in one read him well and he will help you much for the study of character in this book will help you to read it in the world and paint it with your pen 
 i thanked him as well as i could and talk now about my library as if i had a hundred books i never knew how much there was in shakespeare before but then i never had a bhaer to explain it to me now laugh at his horrid name it pronounced either bear or beer as people will say it but something between the two as only germans can give it glad you both like what i tell you about him and hope you will know him some day mother would admire his warm heart father his wise head i admire both and feel rich in my new friend friedrich bhaer 
 not having much money or knowing what like i got several little things and put them about the room where he would find them unexpectedly they were useful pretty or funny a new standish on his table a little vase for his flower he always has one or a bit of green in a glass to keep him fresh he says and a holder for his blower so that he burn up what amy calls mouchoirs i made it like those beth invented a big butterfly with a fat body and black and yellow wings worsted feelers and bead eyes it took his fancy immensely and he put it on his mantlepiece as an article of virtue so it was rather a failure after all poor as he is he forget a servant or a child in the house and not a soul here from the french laundrywoman to miss norton forgot him i was so glad of that 
 they got up a masquerade and had a gay time new eve i mean to go down having no dress but at the last minute mrs kirke remembered some old brocades and miss norton lent me lace and feathers so i dressed up as mrs malaprop and sailed in with a mask on no one knew me for i disguised my voice and no one dreamed of the silent haughty miss march for they think i am very stiff and cool most of them and so i am to whippersnappers could dance and dress and burst out into a nice derangement of epitaphs like an allegory on the banks of the nile i enjoyed it very much and when we unmasked it was fun to see them stare at me i heard one of the young men tell another that he knew been an actress in fact he thought he remembered seeing me at one of the minor theaters meg will relish that joke mr bhaer was nick bottom and tina was titania a perfect little fairy in his arms to see them dance was quite a landscape to use a teddyism 
 i had a very happy new year after all and when i thought it over in my room i felt as if i was getting on a little in spite of my many failures for cheerful all the time now work with a will and take more interest in other people than i used to which is satisfactory bless you all ever your loving jo

lionfish nov chapter the death eaterscontents prev chapter next chapter 
 voldemort looked away from harry and began examining his own body his hands were like large pale spiders his long white fingers caressed his own chest his arms his face the red eyes whose pupils were slits like a cats gleamed still more brightly through the darkness he held up his hands and flexed the fingers his expression rapt and exultant he took not the slightest notice of wormtail who lay twitching and bleeding on the ground nor of the great snake which had slithered back into sight and was circling harry again hissing voldemort slipped one of those unnaturally hands into a deep pocket and drew out a wand he caressed it gently too and then he raised it and pointed it at wormtail who was lifted off the ground and thrown against the headstone where harry was tied he fell to the foot of it and lay there crumpled up and crying voldemort turned his scarlet eyes upon harry laughing a high cold mirthless laugh 
 
 robes were shining with blood now he had wrapped the stump of his arm in them 
 
 my lord he choked my lordyou promisedyou did promise 
 
 hold out your arm said voldemort lazily 
 
 oh masterthank you master 
 
 he extended the bleeding stump but voldemort laughed again 
 
 the other arm wormtail 
 
 master pleaseplease 
 
 voldemort bent down and pulled out left arm he forced the sleeve of robes up past his elbow and harry saw something upon the skin there something like a vivid red tattoo a skull with a snake protruding from its mouth the image that had appeared in the sky at the quidditch world cup the dark mark voldemort examined it carefully ignoring uncontrollable weeping 
 
 it is back he said softly they will all have noticed itand now we shall seenow we shall know 
 
 he pressed his long white forefinger to the brand on arm 
 
 the scar on forehead seared with a sharp pain again and wormtail let out a fresh howl voldemort removed his fingers from mark and harry saw that it had turned jet black 
 
 a look of cruel satisfaction on his face voldemort straightened up threw back his head and stared around at the dark graveyard 
 
 how many will be brave enough to return when they feel it he whispered his gleaming red eyes fixed upon the stars and how many will be foolish enough to stay away 
 
 he began to pace up and down before harry and wormtail eyes sweeping the graveyard all the while after a minute or so he looked down at harry again a cruel smile twisting his snakelike face 
 
 you stand harry potter upon the remains of my late father he hissed softly a muggle and a foolvery like your dear mother but they both had their uses did they not your mother died to defend you as a childand i killed my father and see how useful he has proved himself in death 
 
 voldemort laughed again up and down he paced looking all around him as he walked and the snake continued to circle in the grass 
 
 you see that house upon the hillside potter my father lived there my mother a witch who lived here in this village fell in love with him but he abandoned her when she told him what she like magic my father 
 
 he left her and returned to his muggle parents before i was even born potter and she died giving birth to me leaving me to be raised in a muggle orphanagebut i vowed to find himi revenged myself upon him that fool who gave me his nametom riddle 
 
 still he paced his red eyes darting from grave to grave 
 
 listen to me reliving family history he said quietly why i am growing quite look harry my true family returns 
 
 the air was suddenly full of the swishing of cloaks between graves behind the yew tree in every shadowy space wizards were apparating all of them were hooded and masked and one by one they moved forwardslowly cautiously as though they could hardly believe their eyes voldemort stood in silence waiting for them then one of the death eaters fell to his knees crawled toward voldemort and kissed the hem of his black robes 
 
 mastermaster he murmured 
 
 the death eaters behind him did the same each of them approaching voldemort on his knees and kissing his robes before backing away and standing up forming a silent circle which enclosed tom grave harry voldemort and the sobbing and twitching heap that was wormtail yet they left gaps in the circle as though waiting for more people voldemort however did not seem to expect more he looked around at the hooded faces and though there was no wind rustling seemed to run around the circle as though it had shivered 
 
 welcome death eaters said voldemort quietly thirteen yearsthirteen years since last we met yet you answer my call as though it were yesterday we are still united under the dark mark then or are we 
 
 he put back his terrible face and sniffed his nostrils widening 
 
 i smell guilt he said there is a stench or guilt upon the air 
 
 a second shiver ran around the circle as though each member of it longed but did not dare to step back from him 
 
 i see you all whole and healthy with your powers intact such prompt appearances and i ask myselfwhy did this band of wizards never come to the aid of their master to whom they swore eternal loyalty 
 
 no one spoke no one moved except wormtail who was upon the ground still sobbing over his bleeding arm 
 
 and i answer myself whispered voldemort they must have believed me broken they thought i was gone they slipped back among my enemies and they pleaded innocence and ignorance and bewitchment 
 
 and then i ask myself but how could they have believed i would not rise again they who knew the steps i took long ago to guard myself against mortal death they who had seen proofs of the immensity of my power in the times when i was mightier than any wizard living 
 
 and i answer myself perhaps they believed a still greater power could exist one that could vanquish even lord voldemortperhaps they now pay allegiance to anotherperhaps that champion of commoners of mudbloods and muggles albus dumbledore 
 
 at the mention of name the members of the circle stirred and some muttered and shook their heads voldemort ignored them 
 
 it is a disappointment to mei confess myself disappointed 
 
 one of the men suddenly flung himself forward breaking the circle trembling from head to foot he collapsed at feet 
 
 master he shrieked master forgive me forgive us all 
 
 voldemort began to laugh he raised his wand 
 
 crucio 
 
 the death eater on the ground writhed and shrieked harry was sure the sound must carry to the houses the police come he thought desperatelyanyoneanything 
 
 voldemort raised his wand the tortured death eater lay flat upon the ground gasping 
 
 get up avery said voldemort softly stand up you ask for forgiveness i do not forgive i do not forget thirteen long yearsi want thirteen years repayment before i forgive you wormtail here has paid some of his debt already have you not wormtail 
 
 he looked down at wormtail who continued to sob 
 
 you returned to me not out of loyalty but out of fear of your old friends you deserve this pain wormtail you know that you 
 
 yes master moaned wormtail please masterplease 
 
 yet you helped return me to my body said voldemort coolly watching wormtail sob on the ground worthless and traitorous as you are you helped meand lord voldemort rewards his helpers 
 
 voldemort raised his wand again and whirled it through the air a streak of what looked like molten silver hung shining in the wake momentarily shapeless it writhed and then formed itself into a gleaming replica of a human hand bright as moonlight which soared downward and fixed itself upon bleeding wrist 
 
 sobbing stopped abruptly his breathing harsh and ragged he raised his head and stared in disbelief at the silver hand now attached seamlessly to his arm as though he were wearing a dazzling glove he flexed the shining fingers then trembling picked up a small twig on the ground and crushed it into powder 
 
 my lord he whispered masterit is beautifulthank youthank you 
 
 he scrambled forward on his knees and kissed the hem of robes 
 
 may your loyalty never waver again wormtail said voldemort 
 
 no my lordnever my lord 
 
 wormtail stood up and took his place in the circle staring at his powerful new hand his face still shining with tears voldemort now approached the man on right 
 
 lucius my slippery friend he whispered halting before him i am told that you have not renounced the old ways though to the world you present a respectable face you are still ready to take the lead in a spot of i believe yet you never tried to find me exploits at the quidditch world cup were fun i daresaybut might not your energies have been better directed toward finding and aiding your master 
 
 my lord i was constantly on the alert came lucius voice swiftly from beneath the hood had there been any sign from you any whisper of your whereabouts i would have been at your side immediately nothing could have prevented me 
 
 and yet you ran from my mark when a faithful death eater sent it into the sky last summer said voldemort lazily and mr malfoy stopped talking abruptly yes i know all about that have disappointed expect more faithful service in the future 
 
 of course my lord of are merciful thank you 
 
 voldemort moved on and stopped staring at the space large enough for two people that separated malfoy and the next man 
 
 the lestranges should stand here said voldemort quietly but they are entombed in azkaban they were faithful they went to azkaban rather than renounce azkaban is broken open the lestranges will be honored beyond their dreams the dementors will join usthey are our natural allieswe will recall the banished giantsi shall have all my devoted servants returned to me and an army of creatures whom all fear 
 
 he walked on some of the death eaters he passed in silence but he paused before others and spoke to them 
 
 macnairdestroying dangerous beasts for the ministry of magic now wormtail tells me you shall have better victims than that soon macnair lord voldemort will provide 
 
 thank you masterthank you murmured macnair 
 
 and here voldemort moved on to the two largest hooded figures we have crabbeyou will do better this time will you not crabbe and you goyle 
 
 they bowed clumsily muttering dully 
 
 yes master 
 
 we will master 
 
 the same goes for you nott said voldemort quietly as he walked past a stooped figure in mr goyles shadow 
 
 my lord i prostrate myself before you i am your most faithful 
 
 that will do said voldemort 
 
 he had reached the largest gap of all and he stood surveying it with his blank red eyes as though he could see people standing there 
 
 and here we have six missing death eatersthree dead in my service one too cowardly to returnhe will pay one who i believe has left me foreverhe will be killed of courseand one who remains my most faithful servant and who has already reentered my service 
 
 the death eaters stirred and harry saw their eyes dart sideways at one another through their masks 
 
 he is at hogwarts that faithful servant and it was through his efforts that our young friend arrived here tonight 
 
 yes said voldemort a grin curling his lipless mouth as the eyes of the circle flashed in direction harry potter has kindly joined us for my rebirthing party one might go so far as to call him my guest of honor 
 
 there was a silence then the death eater to the right of wormtail stepped forward and lucius voice spoke from under the mask 
 
 master we crave to knowwe beg you to tell ushow you have achieved thisthis miraclehow you managed to return to us 
 
 ah what a story it is lucius said voldemort and it begins and ends with my young friend here 
 
 he walked lazily over to stand next to harry so that the eyes of the whole circle were upon the two of them the snake continued to circle 
 
 you know of course that they have called this boy my downfall voldemort said softly his red eyes upon harry whose scar began to burn so fiercely that he almost screamed in agony you all know that on the night i lost my powers and my body i tried to kill him his mother died in the attempt to save him and unwittingly provided him with a protection i admit i had not could not touch the boy 
 
 voldemort raised one of his long white fingers and put it very close to cheek 
 
 his mother left upon him the traces other is old magic i should have remembered it i was foolish to overlook itbut no matter i can touch him now 
 
 harry felt the cold tip of the long white finger touch him and thought his head would burst with the pain voldemort laughed softly in his ear then took the finger away and continued addressing the death eaters 
 
 i miscalculated my friends i admit it my curse was deflected by the foolish sacrifice and it rebounded upon myself aaahpain beyond pain my friends nothing could have prepared me for it i was ripped from my body i was less than spirit less than the meanest ghostbut still i was alive what i was even i do not knowi who have gone further than anybody along the path that leads to immortality you know my goal to conquer death and now i was tested and it appeared that one or more of my experiments had workedfor i had not been killed though the curse should have done it nevertheless i was as powerless as the weakest creature alive and without the means to help myselffor i had no body and every spell that might have helped me required the use of a wand 
 
 i remember only forcing myself sleeplessly endlessly second by second to settled in a faraway place in a forest and i one of my faithful death eaters would try and find meone of them would come and perform the magic i could not to restore me to a body but i waited in vain 
 
 the shiver ran once more around the circle of listening death eaters voldemort let the silence spiral horribly before continuing 
 
 only one power remained to me i could possess the bodies of others but i dared not go where other humans were plentiful for i knew that the aurors were still abroad and searching for me 
 
 i sometimes inhabited animals snakes of course being my preference but i was little better off inside them than as pure spirit for their bodies were ill adapted to perform magicand my possession of them shortened their lives none of them lasted long 
 
 thenfour years agothe means for my return seemed assured a wizard young foolish and gullible wandered across my path in the forest i had made my home oh he seemed the very chance i had been dreaming offor he was a teacher at schoolhe was easy to bend to my willhe brought me back to this country and after a while i took possession of his body to supervise him closely as he carried out my orders but my plan failed i did not manage to steal the stone i was not to be assured immortal life i was thwartedthwarted once again by harry potter 
 
 silence once more nothing was stirring not even the leaves on the yew tree the death eaters were quite motionless the glittering eyes in their masks fixed upon voldemort and upon harry 
 
 the servant died when i left his body and i was left as weak as ever i had been voldemort continued i returned to my hiding place far away and i will not pretend to you that i then fear that i might never regain my that was perhaps my darkest houri could not hope that i would be sent another wizard to possessand i had given up hope now that any of my death eaters cared what had become of me 
 
 one or two of the masked wizards in the circle moved uncomfortably but voldemort took no notice 
 
 and then not even a year ago when i had almost abandoned hope it happened at lasta servant returned to me wormtail here who had faked his own death to escape justice was driven out of hiding by those he had once counted friends and decided to return to his master he sought me in the country where it had long been rumored i was hidinghelped of course by the rats he met along the way wormtail has a curious affinity with rats do you not wormtail his filthy little friends told him there was a place deep in an albanian forest that they avoided where small animals like themselves had met their deaths by a dark shadow that possessed them 
 
 but his journey back to me was not smooth was it wormtail for hungry one night on the edge of the very forest where he had hoped to find me he foolishly stopped at an inn for some foodand who should he meet there but one bertha jorkins a witch from the ministry of magic 
 
 now see the way that fate favors lord voldemort this might have been the end of wormtail and of my last hope for regeneration but wormtail displaying a presence of mind i would never have expected from him convinced bertha jorkins to accompany him on a nighttime stroll he overpowered herhe brought her to me and bertha jorkins who might have ruined all proved instead to be a gift beyond my wildest dreamsfor with a little persuasion she became a veritable mine of information 
 
 she told me that the triwizard tournament would be played at hogwarts this year she told me that she knew of a faithful death eater who would be only too willing to help me if i could only contact him she told me many thingsbut the means i used to break the memory charm upon her were powerful and when i had extracted all useful information from her her mind and body were both damaged beyond repair she had now served her purpose i could not possess her i disposed of her 
 
 voldemort smiled his terrible smile his red eyes blank and pitiless 
 
 body of course was ill adapted for possession as all assumed him dead and would attract far too much attention if noticed however he was the servant i needed and poor wizard though he is wormtail was able to follow the instructions i gave him which would return me to a rudimentary weak body of my own a body i would be able to inhabit while awaiting the essential ingredients for true rebirtha spell or two of my own inventiona little help from my dear nagini red eyes fell upon the continually circling snake a potion concocted from unicorn blood and the snake venom nagini providedi was soon returned to an almost human form and strong enough to travel 
 
 there was no hope of stealing the stone anymore for i knew that dumbledore would have seen to it that it was destroyed but i was willing to embrace mortal life again before chasing immortality i set my sights loweri would settle for my old body back again and my old strength 
 
 i knew that to achieve this it is an old piece of dark magic the potion that revived me tonight i would need three powerful ingredients well one of them was already at hand was it not wormtail flesh given by a servant 
 
 my bone naturally meant that we would have to come here where he was buried but the blood of a foewormtail would have had me use any wizard would you not wormtail any wizard who had hated meas so many of them still do but i knew the one i must use if i was to rise again more powerful than i had been when i had fallen i wanted harry potters blood i wanted the blood of the one who had stripped me of power thirteen years agofor the lingering protection his mother once gave him would then reside in my veins too 
 
 but how to get at harry potter for he has been better protected than i think even he knows protected in ways devised by dumbledore long ago when it fell to him to arrange the future dumbledore invoked an ancient magic to ensure the protection as long as he is in his relations care not even i can touch him of course there was the quidditch world thought his protection might be weaker there away from his relations and dumbledore but i was not yet strong enough to attempt kidnap in the midst of a horde of ministry wizards and then the boy would return to hogwarts where he is under the crooked nose of that fool from morning until night so how could i take him 
 
 whyby using bertha information of course use my one faithful death eater stationed at hogwarts to ensure that the name was entered into the goblet of fire use my death eater to ensure that the boy won the tournament that he touched the triwizard cup first the cup which my death eater had turned into a portkey which would bring him here beyond the reach of help and protection and into my waiting arms and here he isthe boy you all believed had been my downfall 
 
 voldemort moved slowly forward and turned to face harry he raised his wand 
 
 crucio 
 
 it was pain beyond anything harry had ever experienced his very bones were on fire his head was surely splitting along his scar his eyes were rolling madly in his head he wanted it to endto black outto die 
 
 and then it was gone he was hanging limply in the ropes binding him to the headstone of father looking up into those bright red eyes through a kind of mist the night was ringing with the sound of the death eaters laughter 
 
 you see i think how foolish it was to suppose that this boy could ever have been stronger than me said voldemort but i want there to be no mistake in mind harry potter escaped me by a lucky chance and i am now going to prove my power by killing him here and now in front of you all when there is no dumbledore to help him and no mother to die for him i will give him his chance he will be allowed to fight and you will be left in no doubt which of us is the stronger just a little longer nagini he whispered and the snake glided away through the grass to where the death eaters stood watching 
 
 now untie him wormtail and give him back his wand 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the goblet of fire
