 november is the most disagreeable month in the whole year said margaret standing at the window one dull afternoon looking out at the frostbitten garden 
 the reason i was born in it observed jo pensively quite unconscious of the blot on her nose 
 if something very pleasant should happen now we should think it a delightful month said beth who took a hopeful view of everything even november 
 i dare say but nothing pleasant ever does happen in this family said meg who was out of sorts we go grubbing along day after day without a bit of change and very little fun we might as well be in a treadmill 
 my patience how blue we are cried jo i much wonder poor dear for you see other girls having splendid times while you grind grind year in and year out oh i wish i could manage things for you as i do for my heroines pretty enough and good enough already so have some rich relation leave you a fortune unexpectedly then dash out as an heiress scorn everyone who has slighted you go abroad and come home my lady something in a blaze of splendor and elegance 
 people have fortunes left them in that style nowadays men have to work and women marry for money a dreadfully unjust world said meg bitterly 
 jo and i are going to make fortunes for you all just wait ten years and see if we said amy who sat in a corner making mud pies as hannah called her little clay models of birds fruit and faces 
 wait and afraid i much faith in ink and dirt though grateful for your good intentions 
 meg sighed and turned to the frostbitten garden again jo groaned and leaned both elbows on the table in a despondent attitude but amy spatted away energetically and beth who sat at the other window said smiling two pleasant things are going to happen right away marmee is coming down the street and laurie is tramping through the garden as if he had something nice to tell 
 in they both came mrs march with her usual question any letter from father girls and laurie to say in his persuasive way some of you come for a drive been working away at mathematics till my head is in a muddle and going to freshen my wits by a brisk turn a dull day but the air bad and going to take brooke home so it will be gay inside if it out come jo you and beth will go you 
 of course we will 
 much obliged but busy and meg whisked out her workbasket for she had agreed with her mother that it was best for her at least not to drive too often with the young gentleman 
 we three will be ready in a minute cried amy running away to wash her hands 
 can i do anything for you madam mother asked laurie leaning over mrs chair with the affectionate look and tone he always gave her 
 no thank you except call at the office if be so kind dear our day for a letter and the postman been father is as regular as the sun but some delay on the way perhaps 
 a sharp ring interrupted her and a minute after hannah came in with a letter 
 one of them horrid telegraph things mum she said handling it as if she was afraid it would explode and do some damage 
 at the word telegraph mrs march snatched it read the two lines it contained and dropped back into her chair as white as if the little paper had sent a bullet to her heart laurie dashed downstairs for water while meg and hannah supported her and jo read aloud in a frightened voice 
 
 
 mrs march 
 your husband is very ill come at once 
 
 s hale 
 blank hospital washington 
 
 how still the room was as they listened breathlessly how strangely the day darkened outside and how suddenly the whole world seemed to change as the girls gathered about their mother feeling as if all the happiness and support of their lives was about to be taken from them 
 mrs march was herself again directly read the message over and stretched out her arms to her daughters saying in a tone they never forgot i shall go at once but it may be too late oh children children help me to bear it 
 for several minutes there was nothing but the sound of sobbing in the room mingled with broken words of comfort tender assurances of help and hopeful whispers that died away in tears poor hannah was the first to recover and with unconscious wisdom she set all the rest a good example for with her work was panacea for most afflictions 
 the lord keep the dear man i waste no time but git your things ready right away mum she said heartily as she wiped her face on her apron gave her mistress a warm shake of the hand with her own hard one and went away to work like three women in one 
 right no time for tears now be calm girls and let me think 
 they tried to be calm poor things as their mother sat up looking pale but steady and put away her grief to think and plan for them 
 laurie she asked presently when she had collected her thoughts and decided on the first duties to be done 
 here oh let me do something cried the boy hurrying from the next room whither he had withdrawn feeling that their first sorrow was too sacred for even his friendly eyes to see 
 send a telegram saying i will come at once the next train goes early in the morning take that 
 what else the horses are ready i can go anywhere do anything he said looking ready to fly to the ends of the earth 
 leave a note at aunt jo give me that pen and paper 
 tearing off the blank side of one of her newly copied pages jo drew the table before her mother well knowing that money for the long sad journey must be borrowed and feeling as if she could do anything to add to a little to the sum for her father 
 now go dear but kill yourself driving at a desperate pace there is no need of that 
 mrs warning was evidently thrown away for five minutes later laurie tore by the window on his own fleet horse riding as if for his life 
 jo run to the rooms and tell mrs king that i come on the way get these things put them down be needed and i must go prepared for nursing hospital stores are not always good beth go and ask mr laurence for a couple of bottles of old wine not too proud to beg for father he shall have the best of everything amy tell hannah to get down the black trunk and meg come and help me find my things for half bewildered 
 writing thinking and directing all at once might well bewilder the poor lady and meg begged her to sit quietly in her room for a little while and let them work everyone scattered like leaves before a gust of wind and the quiet happy household was broken up as suddenly as if the paper had been an evil spell 
 mr laurence came hurrying back with beth bringing every comfort the kind old gentleman could think of for the invalid and friendliest promises of protection for the girls during the absence which comforted her very much there was nothing he offer from his own dressing gown to himself as escort but the last was impossible mrs march would not hear of the old undertaking the long journey yet an expression of relief was visible when he spoke of it for anxiety ill fits one for traveling he saw the look knit his heavy eyebrows rubbed his hands and marched abruptly away saying be back directly no one had time to think of him again till as meg ran through the entry with a pair of rubbers in one hand and a cup of tea in the other she came suddenly upon mr brooke 
 very sorry to hear of this miss march he said in the kind quiet tone which sounded very pleasantly to her perturbed spirit i came to offer myself as escort to your mother mr laurence has commissions for me in washington and it will give me real satisfaction to be of service to her there 
 down dropped the rubbers and the tea was very near following as meg put out her hand with a face so full of gratitude that mr brooke would have felt repaid for a much greater sacrifice than the trifling one of time and comfort which he was about to take 
 how kind you all are mother will accept sure and it will be such a relief to know that she has someone to take care of her thank you very very much 
 meg spoke earnestly and forgot herself entirely till something in the brown eyes looking down at her made her remember the cooling tea and lead the way into the parlor saying she would call her mother 
 everything was arranged by the time laurie returned with a note from aunt march enclosing the desired sum and a few lines repeating what she had often said before that she had always told them it was absurd for march to go into the army always predicted that no good would come of it and she hoped they would take her advice the next time mrs march put the note in the fire the money in her purse and went on with her preparations with her lips folded tightly in a way which jo would have understood if she had been there 
 the short afternoon wore away all other errands were done and meg and her mother busy at some necessary needlework while beth and amy goth tea and hannah finished her ironing with what she called a slap and a bang but still jo did not come they began to get anxious and laurie went off to find her for no one knew what freak jo might take into her head he missed her however and she came walking in with a very queer expression of countenance for there was a mixture of fun and fear satisfaction and regret in it which puzzled the family as much as did the roll of bills she laid before her mother saying with a little choke in her voice my contribution toward making father comfortable and bringing him home 
 my dear where did you get it dollars jo i hope you done anything rash 
 no mine honestly i beg borrow or steal it i earned it and i think blame me for i only sold what was my own 
 as she spoke jo took off her bonnet and a general outcry arose for all her abundant hair was cut short 
 your hair your beautiful hair oh jo how could you your one beauty my dear girl there was no need of this she look like my jo any more but i love her dearly for it 
 as everyone exclaimed and beth hugged the cropped head tenderly jo assumed an indifferent air which did not deceive anyone a particle and said rumpling up the brown bush and trying to look as if she liked it it affect the fate of the nation so wail beth it will be good for my vanity i getting too proud of my wig it will do my brains good to have that mop taken off my head feels deliciously light and cool and the barber said i could soon have a curly crop which will be boyish becoming and easy to keep in order satisfied so please take the money and have supper 
 tell me all about it jo i am not quite satisfied but i blame you for i know how willingly you sacrificed your vanity as you call it to your love but my dear it was not necessary and afraid you will regret it one of these days said mrs march 
 no i returned jo stoutly feeling much relieved that her prank was not entirely condemned 
 what made you do it asked amy who would as soon have thought of cutting off her head as her pretty hair 
 well i was wild to to something for father replied jo as they gathered about the table for healthy young people can eat even in the midst of trouble i hate to borrow as much as mother does and i knew aunt march would croak she always does if you ask for a ninepence meg gave all her quarterly salary toward the rent and i only got some clothes with mine so i felt wicked and was bound to have some money if i sold the nose off my face to get it 
 you feel wicked my child you had no winter things and got the simplest with your own hard earnings said mrs march with a look that warmed heart 
 i the least idea of selling my hair at first but as i went along i kept thinking what i could do and feeling as if like to dive into some of the rich stores and help myself in a window i saw tails of hair with the prices marked and one black tail not so thick as mine was forty dollars it came to me all of a sudden that i had one thing to make money out of and without stopping to think i walked in asked if they bought hair and what they would give for mine 
 i see how you dared to do it said beth in a tone of awe 
 oh he was a little man who looked as if he merely lived to oil his hair he rather stared at first as if he used to having girls bounce into his shop and ask him to buy their hair he said he care about mine it the fashionable color and he never paid much for it in the first place the work he put it into it made it dear and so on it was getting late and i was afraid if it done right away that i have it done at all and you know when i start to do a thing i hate to give it up so i begged him to take it and told him why i was in such a hurry it was silly i dare say but it changed his mind for i got rather excited and told the story in my way and his wife heard and said so kindly take it thomas and oblige the young lady do as much for our jimmy any day if i had a spire of hair worth selling 
 who was jimmy asked amy who liked to have things explained as they went along 
 her son she said who was in the army how friendly such things make strangers feel they she talked away all the time the man clipped and diverted my mind nicely 
 you feel dreadfully when the first cut came asked meg with a shiver 
 i took a last look at my hair while the man got his things and that was the end of it i never snivel over trifles like that i will confess though i felt queer when i saw the dear old hair laid out on the table and felt only the short rough ends of my head it almost seemed as if an arm or leg off the woman saw me look at it and picked out a long lock for me to keep give it to you marmee just to remember past glories by for a crop is so comfortable i think i shall ever have a mane again 
 mrs march folded the wavy chestnut lock and laid it away with a short gray one in her desk she only said thank you deary but something in her face made the girls change the subject and talk as cheerfully as they could about mr kindness the prospect of a fine day tomorrow and the happy times they would have when father came home to be nursed 
 no one wanted to go to bed when at ten mrs march put by the last finished job and said come girls beth went to the piano and played the favorite hymn all began bravely but broke down one by one till beth was left alone singing with all her heart for to her music was always a sweet consoler 
 go to bed and talk for we must be up early and shall need all the sleep we can get good night my darlings said mrs march as the hymn ended for no one cared to try another 
 they kissed her quietly and went to bed as silently as if the dear invalid lay in the next room beth and amy soon fell asleep in spite of the great trouble but meg lay awake thinking the most serious thoughts she had ever known in her short life jo lay motionless and her sister fancied that she was asleep till a stifled sob made her exclaim as she touched a wet cheek 
 jo dear what is it are you crying about father 
 no not now 
 what then 
 hair burst out poor jo trying vainly to smother her emotion in the pillow 
 it did not seem at all comical to meg who kissed and caressed the afflicted heroine in the tenderest manner 
 not sorry protested jo with a choke do it again tomorrow if i could only the vain part of me that goes and cries in this silly way tell anyone all over now i thought you were asleep so i just made a little private moan for my one beauty how came you to be awake 
 i sleep so anxious said meg 
 think about something pleasant and soon drop off 
 i tried it but felt wider awake than ever 
 what did you think of 
 handsome particularly answered meg smiling to herself in the dark 
 what color do you like best 
 brown that is sometimes blue are lovely 
 jo laughed and meg sharply ordered her not to talk then amiably promised to make her hair curl and fell asleep to dream of living in her castle in the air 
 the clocks were striking midnight and the rooms were very still as a figure glided quietly from bed to bed smoothing a coverlet here settling a pillow there and pausing to look long and tenderly at eachunconscious face to kiss each with lips that mutely blessed and to pray the fervent prayers which only mothers utter as she lifted the curtain to look out into the dreary night the moon broke suddenly from behind the clouds and shone upon her like a bright benignant face which seemed to whisper in the silence be comforted dear soul there is always light behind the clouds

 int wall matrix day 
 neo pulls cypher free just as the cop opens fire 
 bullets punching shafts of light like swords into the box 
 of space 
 
 int room matrix day 
 the cop keeps firing his flashlight strapped to his gun 
 barrel lighting up the wall until 
 a bullet spits out his forehead agent smith watches the 
 body fall with a thud 
 agent smith 
 are orders that hard to follow 
 say it again morpheus must 
 be taken alive understand 
 
 int wall matrix day 
 almost falling climbing so fast 
 above them plaster is smashed open as crunbling bits 
 shower down on them filling the crawlway with dust 
 
 int room matrix day 
 agent smith looks into the open wall at the exposed 
 intestines of the building and realizes where they are 
 going 
 agent smith 
 how like a rodent 
 
 int wall matrix day 
 just below a smashes open the wall light 
 raking across the lathe 
 cop 
 i got him i got him 
 trinity finds her gun first pop out the 
 wall as she strafes the room sending cops diving for 
 cover 
 they continue trinity exposed for a roment when a 
 creeping cop smashes a fist through and grabs a fistful 
 of her hair 
 he starts to yank her out when neo kicks his boot 
 bursting through plaster and splintering lathe knocking 
 the cop out 
 they then quickly sink out of sight 
 
 int basement matrix day 
 this part of the basement a dark concrete cavern was 
 the main mechanical room there are four enormous 
 boilers technology that once pumped hot 
 water like arteries 
 black and bloody they squeeze out from the ceiling into 
 the tangled web of pipes 
 their enemies are waiting for them 
 blinding lights cut open the darkness as 
 figures fire grenade launchers 
 smoke blossoms from the canisters 
 morpheus never stops moving searching the floor he 
 finds needs the cover of the catch basin 
 cypher watches him pry open the grate when a gas can 
 bounces near him 
 morpheus 
 come on 
 cypher seems to trip as the cloud envelops him 
 
 int main deck 
 body begins to shiver uncontrollably 
 tank 
 nerve gas 
 
 int basement matrix day 
 morpheus watches cypher disappear into the smoke then 
 follows the others down the hole 
 
 int catch basin matrix day 
 they crawl through greasy black water in a three foot 
 diameter pipe that feeds into the sewer main 
 
 int basement matrix day 
 apparitions find the open hole 
 
 ext hotel lafayette matrix day 
 cypher is carried out his body still 
 shaking mucus bubbling out his nose as he is led past 
 agent smith it almost seems that both men smile 
 agent smith 
 we have them now 
 
 int sewer main matrix day 
 neo punches out the screen and then spills down into the 
 main water trough 
 oily water forms around them as they wade across the man 
 made underground river towards the service catwalk 
 neo is about to pull himself out when he sees them coming 
 flashlights and laser sites sweep at them as cops in 
 helmets and heavy armor looking more nachine than human 
 fill both ends of the tunnel 
 there is a single manhole cover above them 
 morpheus whispers to trinity 
 morpheus 
 you have to get neo out understand all that 
 matters now 
 trinity 
 morpheus 
 morpheus 
 he must get out do you understand me 
 she nods 
 a font of water erupts as morpheus leaps for the manhole 
 ladder his coat flying open like the wings of a manta ray 
 cops 
 there he is him 
 pools of light wash over him as he hauls himself to the 
 surface 
 cop 
 heading for the street 
 trinity urges the others to follow her grabbing neo 
 they wade quietly away from the chaos 
 
 ext street matrix day 
 morpheus shoots out of the sewer but the police are 
 waiting for him the closest cop is armed with a 
 tranquilized gun he fires 
 but morpheus is too fast using the manhole cover as a 
 shield blocking the darts then 
 it into the armored chest knocking him 
 off his feet 
 the cops lunge at him but every part of his body is a 
 deadly weapon moving with impossible speed 
 it seems he might fight his way out when he throws a 
 spinning back fist that is caught by 
 agent smith 
 agent smith 
 so we meet at last 
 morpheus 
 and you are 
 agent smith 
 smith i am agent smith 
 morpheus 
 you all look the same to me 
 agent smith 
 been waiting for this noment 
 faster than a snake spits morpheus cracks smith with a 
 right 
 morpheus 
 oh so have i 
 agent smith smiles 
 
 int sewer main matrix day 
 trinity leads the others fading into the darkness of the 
 tunnel lit only with shafts of lights streaming through 
 the street drains as we rise towards them 
 through a grate into the fight 
 
 ext street matrix day 
 smith and morpheus exchange a furious serious of blows 
 that is witnessed but not believed by the surrounding 
 police 
 agent smith delivers a punishing kick that staggers 
 morpheus 
 agent smith 
 you win 
 morpheus smiles 
 morpheus 
 i already have 
 he stands up and drops his fists a steely resolve in his 
 eyes 
 agent smith 
 take him 
 cops swarm over morpheus 
 
 int main deck 
 tank reaches out to the screen as if reaching for 
 morpheus

lionfish nov chapter fifteen aragogcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 summer was creeping over the grounds around the castle sky and lake alike turned periwinkle blue and flowers large as cabbages burst into bloom in the greenhouses but with no hagrid visible from the castle windows striding the grounds with fang at his heels the scene look right to harry no better in fact than the inside of the castle where things were so horribly wrong 
 
 harry and ron had tried to visit hermione but visitors were now barred from the hospital wing 
 
 taking no more chances madam pomfrey told them severely through a crack in the infirmary door no sorry every chance the attacker might come back to finish these people off 
 
 with dumbledore gone fear had spread as never before so that the sun warming the castle walls outside seemed to stop at the mullioned windows there was barely a face to be seen in the school that look worried and tense and any laughter that rang through the corridors sounded shrill and unnatural and was quickly stifled 
 
 harry constantly repeated final words to himself i will only truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me help will always be given at hogwarts to those who ask for it but what good were these words who exactly were they supposed to ask for help when everyone was just as confused and scared as they were 
 
 hint about the spiders was far easier to understand the trouble was there seem to be a single spider left in the castle to follow harry looked everywhere he went helped rather reluctantly by ron they were hampered of course by the fact that they allowed to wander off on their own but had to move around the castle in a pack with the other gryffindors most of their fellow students seemed glad that they were being shepherded from class to class by teachers but harry found it very irksome 
 
 one person however seemed to be thoroughly enjoying the atmosphere of terror and suspicion draco malfoy was strutting around the school as though he had just been appointed head boy harry realize what he was so pleased about until the potions lesson about two weeks after dumbledore and hagrid had left when sitting right behind malfoy harry overheard him gloating to crabbe and goyle 
 
 i always thought father might be the one who got rid of dumbledore he said not troubling to keep his voice down i told you he thinks the worst headmaster the ever had maybe get a decent headmaster now someone who want the chamber of secrets closed mcgonagall last long only filling in 
 
 snape swept past harry making no comment about empty seat and cauldron 
 
 sir said malfoy loudly sir why you apply for the job 
 
 now now malfoy said snape though he suppress a smile professor dumbledore has only been suspended by the governors i daresay be back with us soon enough 
 
 yeah right said malfoy smirking i expect have vote sir if you wanted to apply for the job tell father the best teacher here sir 
 
 snape smirked as he swept off around the dungeon fortunately not spotting seamus finnigan who was pretending to vomit into his cauldron 
 
 quite surprised the mudbloods all packed their bags by now malfoy went on bet you five galleons the next one dies pity it granger 
 
 the bell rang at that moment which was lucky at last words ron had leapt off his stool and in the scramble to collect bags and books his attempts to reach malfoy went unnoticed 
 
 let me at him ron growled as harry and dean hung onto his arms i care i need my wand going to kill him with my bare hands 
 
 hurry up got to take you all to herbology barked snape over the heads and off they marched with harry ron and dean bringing up the rear ron still trying to get loose it was only safe to let go of him when snape had seen them out of the castle and they were making their way across the vegetable patch toward the greenhouses 
 
 the herbology class was very subdued there were now two missing from their number justin and hermione 
 
 professor sprout set them all to work pruning the abyssinian shrivelfigs harry went to tip an armful of withered stalks onto the compost heap and found himself with ernie macmillan ernie took a deep breath and said very formally i just want to say harry that sorry i ever suspected you i know never attack hermione granger and i apologize for all the stuff i said all in the same boat now and well 
 
 he held out a pudgy hand and harry shook it 
 
 ernie and his friend hannah came to work at the same shrivelfig as harry and ron 
 
 that draco malfoy character said ernie breaking off dead twigs he seems very pleased about all this he know i think he might be heir 
 
 clever of you said ron who seem to have forgiven ernie as readily as harry 
 
 do you think malfoy harry ernie asked 
 
 no said harry so firmly that ernie and hannah stared 
 
 a second later harry spotted something 
 
 several large spiders were scuttling over the ground on the other side of the glass moving in an unnaturally straight line as though taking the shortest route to a prearranged meeting harry hit ron over the hand with his pruning shears 
 
 ouch you 
 
 harry pointed out the spiders following their progress with his eyes screwed up against the sun 
 
 oh yeah said ron trying and failing to look pleased but we follow them now 
 
 ernie and hannah were listening curiously 
 
 eyes narrowed as he focused on the spiders if they pursued their fixed course there could be no doubt about where they would end up 
 
 looks like heading for the forbidden forest 
 
 and ron looked even unhappier about that 
 
 at the end of the lesson professor sprout escorted the class to their defense against the dark arts lesson harry and ron lagged behind the others so they could talk out of earshot 
 
 have to use the invisibility cloak again harry told ron we can take fang with us used to going into the forest with hagrid he might be some help 
 
 right said ron who was twirling his wand nervously in his fingers er there there supposed to be werewolves in the forest he added as they took their usual places at the back of classroom 
 
 preferring not to answer that question harry said there are good things in there too the centaurs are all right and the unicorns 
 
 ron had never been into the forbidden forest before harry had entered it only once and had hoped never to do so again 
 
 lockhart bounded into the room and the class stared at him every other teacher in the place was looking grimmer than usual but lockhart appeared nothing short of buoyant 
 
 come now he cried beaming around him why all these long faces 
 
 people swapped exasperated looks but nobody answered 
 
 you people realize said lockhart speaking slowly as though they were all a bit dim the danger has passed the culprit has been taken away 
 
 says who said dean thomas loudly 
 
 my dear young man the minister of magic have taken hagrid if he been one hundred percent sure that he was guilty said lockhart in the tone of someone explaining that one and one made two 
 
 oh yes he would said ron even more loudly than dean 
 
 i flatter myself i know a touch more about arrest than you do mr weasley said lockhart in a tone 
 
 ron started to say that he think so somehow but stopped in midsentence when harry kicked him hard under the desk 
 
 we there remember harry muttered 
 
 but disgusting cheeriness his hints that he had always thought hagrid was no good his confidence that the whole business was now at an end irritated harry so much that he yearned to throw gadding with ghouls right in stupid face instead he contented himself with scrawling a note to ron do it tonight 
 
 ron read the message swallowed hard and looked sideways at the empty seat usually filled by hermione the sight seemed to stiffen his resolve and he nodded 
 
 the gryffindor common room was always very crowded these days because from six onward the gryffindors had nowhere else to go they also had plenty to talk about with the result that the common room often empty until past midnight 
 
 harry went to get the invisibility cloak out of his trunk right after dinner and spent the evening sitting on it waiting for the room to clear fred and george challenged harry and ron to a few games of exploding snap and ginny sat watching them very subdued in usual chair harry and ron kept losing on purpose trying to finish the games quickly but even so it was well past midnight when fred george and ginny finally went to bed 
 
 harry and ron waited for the distant sounds of two dormitory doors closing before seizing the cloak throwing it over themselves and climbing through the portrait hole 
 
 it was another difficult journey through the castle dodging all the teachers at last they reached the entrance hall slid back the lock on the oak front doors squeezed between them trying to stop any creaking and stepped out into the moonlit grounds 
 
 course said ron abruptly as they strode across the black grass we might get to the forest and find nothing to follow those spiders might been going there at all i know it looked like they were moving in that sort of general direction but 
 
 his voice trailed away hopefully 
 
 they reached house sad and with its blank windows when harry pushed the door open fang went mad with joy at the sight of them worried he might wake everyone at the castle with his deep booming barks they hastily fed him treacle fudge from a tin on the mantelpiece which glued his teeth together 
 
 harry left the invisibility cloak on table there would be no need for it in the forest 
 
 fang going for a walk said harry patting his leg and fang bounded happily out of the house behind them dashed to the edge of the forest and lifted his leg against a large sycamore tree 
 
 harry took out his wand murmured lumos and a tiny light appeared at the end of it just enough to let them watch the path for signs of spiders 
 
 good thinking said ron light mine too but you know probably blow up or something 
 
 harry tapped ron on the shoulder pointing at the grass two solitary spiders were hurrying away from the wandlight into the shade of the trees 
 
 okay ron sighed as though resigned to the worst ready go 
 
 so with fang scampering around them sniffing tree roots and leaves they entered the forest by the glow of wand they followed the steady trickle of spiders moving along the path they walked behind them for about twenty minutes not speaking listening hard for noises other than breaking twigs and rustling leaves then when the trees had become thicker than ever so that the stars overhead were no longer visible and wand shone alone in the sea of dark they saw their spider guides leaving the path 
 
 harry paused trying to see where the spiders were going but everything outside his little sphere of light was he had never been this deep into the forest before he could vividly remember hagrid advising him not to leave the forest path last time been in here but hagrid was miles away now probably sitting in a cell in azkaban and he had also said to follow the spiders 
 
 something wet touched hand and he jumped backward crushing foot but it was only nose 
 
 what reckon harry said to ron whose eyes he could just make out reflecting the light from his wand 
 
 come this far said ron 
 
 so they followed the darting shadows of the spiders into the trees they move very quickly now there were tree roots and stumps in their way barely visible in the near blackness harry could feel hot breath on his hand more than once they had to stop so that harry could crouch down and find the spiders in the wandlight 
 
 they walked for what seemed like at least half an hour their robes snagging on branches and brambles after a while they noticed that the ground seemed to be sloping downward though the trees were as thick as ever 
 
 then fang suddenly let loose a great echoing bark making both harry and ron jump out of their skins 
 
 what said ron loudly looking around into the and gripping elbow very hard 
 
 something moving over there harry breathed listen sounds like something big 
 
 they listened some distance to their right the something big was snapping branches as it carved a path through the trees 
 
 oh no said ron oh no oh no oh 
 
 shut up said harry frantically hear you 
 
 hear me said ron in an unnaturally high voice already heard fang 
 
 the darkness seemed to be pressing on their eyeballs as they stood terrified waiting there was a strange rumbling noise and then silence 
 
 what think doing said harry 
 
 probably getting ready to pounce said ron 
 
 they waited shivering hardly daring to move 
 
 think gone harry whispered 
 
 dunno 
 
 then to their right came a sudden blaze of light so bright in the darkness that both of them flung up their hands to shield their eyes fang yelped and tried to run but got lodged in a tangle of thorns and yelped even louder 
 
 harry ron shouted his voice breaking with relief harry our car 
 
 what 
 
 come on 
 
 harry blundered after ron toward the light stumbling and tripping and a moment later they had emerged into a clearing 
 
 mr car was standing empty in the middle of a circle of thick trees under a roof of dense branches its headlights ablaze as ron walked toward it it moved slowly toward him exactly like a large turquoise dog greeting its owner 
 
 been here all the time said ron delightedly walking around the car look at it the turned it wild 
 
 the sides of the car were scratched and smeared with mud apparently it had taken to trundling around the forest on its own fang seem at all keen on it he kept close to harry who could feel him quivering his breathing slowing down again harry stuffed his wand back into his robes 
 
 and we thought it was going to attack us said ron leaning against the car and patting it i wondered where it had gone 
 
 harry squinted around on the floodlit ground for signs of more spiders but they had all scuttled away from the glare of the headlights 
 
 lost the trail he said go and find them 
 
 ron speak he move his eyes were fixed on a point some ten feet above the forest floor right behind harry his face was livid with terror 
 
 harry even have time to turn around there was a loud clicking noise and suddenly he felt something long and hairy seize him around the middle and lift him off the ground so that he was hanging facedown struggling terrified he heard more clicking and saw legs leave the ground too heard fang whimpering and howling next moment he was being swept away into the dark trees 
 
 head hanging harry saw that what had hold of him was marching on six immensely long hairy legs the front two clutching him tightly below a pair of shining black pincers behind him he could hear another of the creatures no doubt carrying ron they were moving into the very heart of the forest harry could hear fang fighting to free himself from a third monster whining loudly but harry have yelled even if he had wanted to he seemed to have left his voice back with the car in the clearing 
 
 he never knew how long he was in the clutches he only knew that the darkness suddenly lifted enough for him to see that the ground was now swarming with spiders craning his neck sideways he realized that they had reached the ridge of a vast hollow a hollow that had been cleared of trees so that the stars shone brightly onto the worst scene he had ever laid eyes on 
 
 spiders not tiny spiders like those surging over the leaves below spiders the size of carthorses black hairy gigantic the massive specimen that was carrying harry made its way down the steep slope toward a misty domed web in the very center of the hollow while its fellows closed in all around it clicking their pincers excitedly at the sight of its load 
 
 harry fell to the ground on all fours as the spider released him ron and fang thudded down next to him fang howling anymore but cowering silently on the spot ron looked exactly like harry felt his mouth was stretched wide in a kind of silent scream and his eyes were popping 
 
 harry suddenly realized that the spider that had dropped him was saying something it had been hard to tell because he clicked his pincers with every word he spoke 
 
 aragog it called aragog 
 
 and from the middle of the misty domed web a spider the size of a small elephant emerged very slowly there was gray in the black of his body and legs and each of the eyes on his ugly pincered head was milky white he was blind 
 
 what is it he said clicking his pincers rapidly 
 
 men clicked the spider who had caught harry 
 
 is it hagrid said aragog moving closer his eight milky eyes wandering vaguely 
 
 strangers clicked the spider who had brought ron 
 
 kill them clicked aragog fretfully i was sleeping 
 
 friends of harry shouted his heart seemed to have left his chest to pound in his throat 
 
 click click click went the pincers of the spiders all around the hollow 
 
 aragog paused 
 
 hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before he said slowly 
 
 in trouble said harry breathing very fast why come 
 
 in trouble said the aged spider and harry thought he heard concern beneath the clicking pincers but why has he sent you 
 
 harry thought of getting to his feet but decided against it he think his legs would support him so he spoke from the ground as calmly as he could 
 
 they think up at the school that been setting a a something on students taken him to azkaban 
 
 aragog clicked his pincers furiously and all around the hollow the sound was echoed by the crowd of spiders it was like applause except applause usually make harry feel sick with fear 
 
 but that was years ago said aragog fretfully years and years ago i remember it well why they made him leave the school they believed that i was the monster that dwells in what they call the chamber of secrets they thought that hagrid had opened the chamber and set me free 
 
 and you you come from the chamber of secrets said harry who could feel cold sweat on his forehead 
 
 i said aragog clicking angrily i was not born in the castle i come from a distant land a traveler gave me to hagrid when i was an egg hagrid was only a boy but he cared for me hidden in a cupboard in the castle feeding me on scraps from the table hagrid is my good friend and a good man when i was discovered and blamed for the death of a girl he protected me i have lived here in the forest ever since where hagrid still visits me he even found me a wife mosag and you see how our family has grown all through goodness 
 
 harry summoned what remained of his courage 
 
 so you never never attacked anyone 
 
 never croaked the old spider it would have been my instinct but out of respect for hagrid i never harmed a human the body of the girl who was killed was discovered in a bathroom i never saw any part of the castle but the cupboard in which i grew up our kind like the dark and the quiet 
 
 but then do you know what did kill that girl said harry because whatever it is back and attacking people again 
 
 his words were drowned by a loud outbreak of clicking and the rustling of many long legs shifting angrily large black shapes shifted all around him 
 
 the thing that lives in the castle said aragog is an ancient creature we spiders fear above all others well do i remember how i pleaded with hagrid to let me go when i sensed the beast moving about the school 
 
 what is it said harry urgently 
 
 more loud clicking more rustling the spiders seemed to be closing in 
 
 we do not speak of it said aragog fiercely we do not name it i never even told hagrid the name of that dread creature though he asked me many times 
 
 harry want to press the subject not with the spiders pressing closer on all sides aragog seemed to be tired of talking he was backing slowly into his domed web but his fellow spiders continued to inch slowly toward harry and ron 
 
 just go then harry called desperately to aragog hearing leaves rustling behind him 
 
 go said aragog slowly i think not 
 
 but but 
 
 my sons and daughters do not harm hagrid on my command but i cannot deny them fresh meat when it wanders so willingly into our midst friend of hagrid 
 
 harry spun around feet away towering above him was a solid wall of spiders clicking their many eyes gleaming in their ugly black heads 
 
 even as he reached for his wand harry knew it was no good there were too many of them but as he tried to stand ready to die fighting a loud long note sounded and a blaze of light flamed through the hollow 
 
 mr car was thundering down the slope headlights glaring its horn screeching knocking spiders aside several were thrown onto their backs their endless legs waving in the air the car screeched to a halt in front of harry and ron and the doors flew open 
 
 get fang harry yelled diving into the front seat ron seized the boarhound around the middle and threw him yelping into the back of the car the doors slammed shut ron touch the accelerator but the car need him the engine roared and they were off hitting more spiders they sped up the slope out of the hollow and they were soon crashing through the forest branches whipping the windows as the car wound its way cleverly through the widest gaps following a path it obviously knew 
 
 harry looked sideways at ron his mouth was still open in the silent scream but his eyes popping anymore 
 
 are you okay 
 
 ron stared straight ahead unable to speak 
 
 they smashed their way through the undergrowth fang howling loudly in the back seat and harry saw the side mirror snap off as they squeezed past a large oak after ten noisy rocky minutes the trees thinned and harry could again see patches of sky 
 
 the car stopped so suddenly that they were nearly thrown into the windshield they had reached the edge of the forest fang flung himself at the window in his anxiety to get out and when harry opened the door he shot off through the trees to house tail between his legs harry got out too and after a minute or so ron seemed to regain the feeling in his limbs and followed still and staring harry gave the car a grateful pat as it reversed back into the forest and disappeared from view 
 
 harry went back into cabin to get the invisibility cloak fang was trembling under a blanket in his basket when harry got outside again he found ron being violent sick in the pumpkin patch 
 
 follow the spiders said ron weakly wiping his mouth on his sleeve never forgive hagrid lucky to be alive 
 
 i bet he thought aragog hurt friends of his said harry 
 
 exactly problem said ron thumping the wall of the cabin he always thinks monsters as bad as made out and look where got him a cell in azkaban he was shivering uncontrollably now what was the point of sending us in there what have we found out like to know 
 
 that hagrid never opened the chamber of secrets said harry throwing the cloak over ron and prodding him in the arm to make him walk he was innocent 
 
 ron gave a loud snort evidently hatching aragog in a cupboard his idea of being innocent 
 
 as the castle loomed nearer harry twitched the cloak to make sure their feet were hidden then pushed the creaking front doors ajar they walked carefully back across the entrance hall and up the marble staircase holding their breath as they passed corridors where watchful sentries were walking at last they reached the safety of the gryffindor common room where the fire had burned itself into glowing ash they took off the cloak and climbed the winding stair to their dormitory 
 
 ron fell onto his bed without bothering to get undressed harry however feel very sleepy he sat on the edge of his fourposter thinking hard about everything aragog had said 
 
 the creature that was lurking somewhere in the castle he thought sounded like a sort of monster voldemort even other monsters want to name it but he and ron were no closer to finding out what it was or how it petrified its victims even hagrid had never known what was in the chamber of secrets 
 
 harry swung his legs up onto his bed and leaned back against his pillows watching the moon glinting at him through the tower window 
 
 he see what else they could do they had hit dead ends everywhere riddle had caught the wrong person the heir of slytherin had got off and no one could tell whether it was the same person or a different one who had opened the chamber this time there was nobody else to ask harry lay down still thinking about what aragog had said 
 
 he was becoming drowsy when what seemed like their very last hope occurred to him and he suddenly sat bolt upright 
 
 ron he hissed through the dark ron 
 
 ron woke with a yelp like stared wildly around and saw harry 
 
 ron that girl who died aragog said she was found in a bathroom said harry ignoring snuffling snores from the corner what if she never left the bathroom what if still there 
 
 ron rubbed his eyes frowning through the moonlight and then he understood too 
 
 you think not moaning myrtle 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the chamber of secrets 
 

lionfish nov chapter fourteen grudgecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 no one in gryffindor tower slept that night they knew that the castle was being searched again and the whole house stayed awake in the common room waiting to hear whether black had been caught professor mcgonagall came back at dawn to tell them that he had again escaped 
 
 throughout the day everywhere they went they saw signs of tighter security professor flitwick could be seen teaching the front doors to recognize a large picture of sirius black filch was suddenly bustling up and down the corridors boarding up everything from tiny cracks in the walls to mouse holes sir cadogan had been fired his portrait had been taken back to its lonely landing on the seventh floor and the fat lady was back she had been expertly restored but was still extremely nervous and had agreed to return to her job only on condition that she was given extra protection a bunch of surly security trolls had been hired to guard her they paced the corridor in a menacing group talking in grunts and comparing the size of their clubs 
 
 harry help noticing that the statue of the witch on the third floor remained unguarded and unblocked it seemed that fred and george had been right in thinking that they and now harry ron and hermione were the only ones who knew about the hidden passageway within it 
 
 reckon we should tell someone harry asked ron 
 
 we know not coming in through said ron dismissively heard if the shop had been broken into 
 
 harry was glad ron took this view if the witch was boarded up too he would never be able to go into hogsmeade again 
 
 ron had become an instant celebrity for the first time in his life people were paying more attention to him than to harry and it was clear that ron was rather enjoying the experience though still severely shaken by the events he was happy to tell anyone who asked what had happened with a wealth of detail 
 
 i was asleep and i heard this ripping noise and i thought it was in my dream you know but then there was this drafti woke up and one side of the hangings on my bed had been pulled downi rolled overand i saw him standing over melike a skeleton with loads of filthy hairholding this great long knife been twelve inchesand he looked at me and i looked at him and then i yelled and he scampered 
 
 why though ron added to harry as the group of second year girls who had been listening to his chilling tale departed why did he run 
 
 harry had been wondering the same thing why had black having got the wrong bed not silenced ron and proceeded to harry black had proved twelve years ago that he mind murdering innocent people and this time he had been facing five unarmed boys four of whom were asleep 
 
 he known have a job getting back out of the castle once yelled and woken people up said harry thoughtfully had to kill the whole house to get back through the portrait holethen he met the teachers 
 
 neville was in total disgrace professor mcgonagall was so furious with him she had banned him from all future hogsmeade visits given him a detention and forbidden anyone to give him the password into the tower poor neville was forced to wait outside the common room every night for somebody to let him in while the security trolls leered unpleasantly at him none of these punishments however came close to matching the one his grandmother had in store for him two days after she sent neville the very worst thing a hogwarts student could receive over breakfast a howler 
 
 the school owls swooped into the great hall carrying the mail as usual and neville choked as a huge barn owl landed in front of him a scarlet envelope clutched in its beak harry and ron who were sitting opposite him recognized the letter as a howler at once ron had got one from his mother the year before 
 
 run for it neville ron advised 
 
 neville need telling twice he seized the envelope and holding it before him like a bomb sprinted out of the hall while the slytherin table exploded with laughter at the sight of him they heard the howler go off in the entrance hall voice magically magnified to a hundred times its usual volume shrieking about how he had brought shame on the whole family 
 
 harry was too busy feeling sorry for neville to notice immediately that he had a letter too hedwig got his attention by nipping him sharply on the wrist 
 
 ouch oh thanks hedwig 
 
 harry tore open the envelope while hedwig helped herself to some of cornflakes the note inside said 
 
 dear harry and ron 
 how about having tea with me this afternoon round six come collect you from the castle wait for me in the entrance hall not allowed out on your own 
 cheers 
 hagrid 
 he probably wants to hear all about black said ron 
 
 so at six that afternoon harry and ron left gryffindor tower passed the security trolls at a run and headed down to the entrance hall 
 
 hagrid was already waiting for them 
 
 all right hagrid said ron you want to hear about saturday night do you 
 
 already heard all abou it said hagrid opening the front doors and leading them outside 
 
 oh said ron looking slightly put out 
 
 the first thing they saw on entering cabin was buckbeak who was stretched out on top of patchwork quilt his enormous wings folded tight to his body enjoying a large plate of dead ferrets averting his eyes from this unpleasant sight harry saw a gigantic hairy brown suit and a very horrible tie hanging from the top of wardrobe door 
 
 what are they for hagrid said harry 
 
 case against the committee fer the disposal o dangerous creatures said hagrid this friday him an be goin down ter london together booked two beds on the knight bus 
 
 harry felt a nasty pang of guilt he had completely forgotten that trial was so near and judging by the uneasy look on face he had too they had also forgotten their promise about helping him prepare defense the arrival of the firebolt had driven it clean out of their minds 
 
 hagrid poured them tea and offered them a plate of bath buns but they knew better than to accept they had had too much experience with cooking 
 
 i got somethin ter discuss with you two said hagrid sitting himself between them and looking uncharacteristically serious 
 
 what said harry 
 
 hermione said hagrid 
 
 what about her said ron 
 
 in a righ state what bin comin down ter visit me a lot since bin feelin lonely firs yeh weren talking to her because o the firebolt now yer not talkin to her because her cat 
 
 c ate scabbers ron interjected angrily

 hagrid we helped as well sorry harry began awkwardly 
 
 not blamin yeh said hagrid waving apology aside gawd knows had enough ter be getting on with seen yeh practicin quidditch hour o the day an night but i gotta tell yeh i thought you value yer friend broomsticks or rats all 
 
 harry and ron exchanged uncomfortable looks 
 
 really upset she was when black nearly stabbed yeh ron got her heart in the right place hermione has an you two not talkin to her 
 
 if just get rid of that cat speak to her again ron said angrily but still sticking up for it a maniac and she hear a word against it 
 
 ah well people can be a bit stupid abou their pets said hagrid wisely behind him buckbeak spat a few ferret bones onto pillow 
 
 they spent the rest of their visit discussing improved chances for the quidditch cup at nine hagrid walked them back up to the castle 
 
 a large group of people was bunched around the bulletin board when they returned to the common room 
 
 hogsmeade next weekend said ron craning over the heads to read the new notice what reckon he added quietly to harry as they went to sit down 
 
 well filch done anything about the passage into honeydukes harry said even more quietly 
 
 harry said a voice in his right ear harry started and looked around at hermione who was sitting at the table right behind them and clearing a space in the wall of books that had been hiding her 
 
 harry if you go into hogsmeade tell professor mcgonagall about that map said hermione 
 
 can you hear someone talking harry growled ron not looking at hermione 
 
 ron how can you let him go with you after what sirius black nearly did to you i mean it tell 
 
 so now trying to get harry expelled said ron furiously you done enough damage this year 
 
 hermione opened her mouth to respond but with a soft hiss crookshanks leapt onto her lap hermione took one frightened look at the expression on face gathered up crookshanks and hurried away toward the girls dormitories 
 
 so how about it ron said to harry as though there had been no interruption come on last time we went you see anything you even been inside yet 
 
 harry looked around to check that hermione was well out of earshot 
 
 okay he said but taking the invisibility cloak this time 
 
 
 
 on saturday morning harry packed his invisibility cloak in his bag slipped the map into his pocket and went down to breakfast with everyone else hermione kept shooting suspicious looks down the table at him but he avoided her eye and was careful to let her see him walking back up the marble staircase in the entrance hall as everybody else proceeded to the front doors 
 
 bye harry called to ron see you when you get back 
 
 ron grinned and winked 
 
 harry hurried up to the third floor slipping the map out of his pocket as he went crouching behind the witch he smoothed it out a tiny dot was moving in his direction harry squinted at it the minuscule writing next to it read neville longbottom 
 
 harry quickly pulled out his wand muttered dissendium and shoved his bag into the statue but before he could climb in himself neville came around the corner 
 
 harry i forgot you going to hogsmeade either 
 
 hi neville said harry moving swiftly away from the statue and pushing the map back into his pocket what are you up to 
 
 nothing shrugged neville want a game of exploding snap 
 
 er not now i was going to go to the library and do that vampire essay for lupin 
 
 come with you said neville brightly i done it either 
 
 er hang on yeah i forgot i finished it last night 
 
 great you can help me said neville his round face anxious i understand that thing about the garlic at all do they have to eat it or 
 
 he broke off with a small gasp looking over shoulder 
 
 it was snape neville took a quick step behind harry 
 
 and what are you two doing here said snape coming to a halt and looking from one to the other an odd place to meet 
 
 to immense disquiet black eyes flicked to the doorways on either side of them and then to the witch 
 
 not meeting here said harry we just met here 
 
 indeed said snape you have a habit of turning up in unexpected places potter and you are very rarely there for no good reasoni suggest the pair of you return to gryffindor tower where you belong 
 
 harry and neville set off without another word as they turned the corner harry looked back snape was running one of his hands over the head examining it closely 
 
 harry managed to shake neville off at the fat lady by telling him the password then pretending left his vampire essay in the library and doubling back once out of sight of the security trolls he pulled out the map again and held it close to his nose 
 
 the third floor corridor seemed to be deserted harry scanned the map carefully and saw with a leap of relief that the tiny dot labeled severus snape was now back in its office 
 
 he sprinted back to the witch opened her hump heaved himself inside and slid down to meet his bag at the bottom of the stone chute he wiped the map blank again then set off at a run 
 
 
 
 harry completely hidden beneath the invisibility cloak emerged into the sunlight outside honeydukes and prodded ron in the back 
 
 me he muttered 
 
 what kept you ron hissed 
 
 snape was hanging around 
 
 they set off up the high street 
 
 where are you ron kept muttering out of the corner of his mouth are you still there this feels weird 
 
 they went to the post office ron pretended to be checking the price of an owl to bill in egypt so that harry could have a good look around the owls sat hooting softly down at him at least three hundred of them from great grays right down to tiny little scops owls local deliveries only which were so small they could have sat in the palm of hand 
 
 then they visited which was so packed with students harry had to exercise great care not to tread on anyone and cause a panic there were jokes and tricks to fulfill even and wildest dreams harry gave ron whispered orders and passed him some gold from under the cloak they left with their money bags considerably lighter than they had been on entering but their pockets bulging with dungbombs hiccup sweets frog spawn soap and a teacup apiece 
 
 the day was fine and breezy and neither of them felt like staying indoors so they walked past the three broomsticks and climbed a slope to visit the shrieking shack the most haunted dwelling in britain it stood a little way above the rest of the village and even in daylight was slightly creepy with its boarded windows and dank overgrown garden 
 
 even the hogwarts ghosts avoid it said ron as they leaned on the fence looking up at it i asked nearly headless nickhe says heard a very rough crowd lives here no one can get in fred and george tried obviously but all the entrances are sealed shut 
 
 harry feeling hot from their climb was just considering taking off the cloak for a few minutes when they heard voices nearby someone was climbing toward the house from the other side of the hill moments later malfoy had appeared followed closely by crabbe and goyle malfoy was speaking 
 
 should have an owl from father any time now he had to go to the hearing to tell them about my armabout how i use it for three months 
 
 crabbe and goyle sniggered 
 
 i really wish i could hear that great hairy moron trying to defend no arm in im onest that as good as dead 
 
 malfoy suddenly caught sight of ron his pale face split in a malevolent grin 
 
 what are you doing weasley 
 
 malfoy looked up at the crumbling house behind ron 
 
 suppose love to live here you weasley dreaming about having your own bedroom i heard your family all sleep in one room is that true 
 
 harry seized the back of robes to stop him from leaping on malfoy 
 
 leave him to me he hissed in ear 
 
 the opportunity was too perfect to miss harry crept silently around behind malfoy crabbe and goyle bent down and scooped a large handful of mud out of the path 
 
 we were just discussing your friend hagrid malfoy said to ron just trying to imagine what saying to the committee for the disposal of dangerous creatures think cry when they cut off his 
 
 splat 
 
 head jerked forward as the mud hit him his silverblond hair was suddenly dripping in muck 
 
 what the 
 
 ron had to hold onto the fence to keep himself standing he was laughing so hard malfoy crabbe and goyle spun stupidly on the spot staring wildly around malfoy trying to wipe his hair clean 
 
 what was that who did that 
 
 very haunted up here it said ron with the air of one commenting on the weather 
 
 crabbe and goyle were looking scared their bulging muscles were no use against ghosts malfoy was staring madly around at the deserted landscape 
 
 harry sneaked along the path where a particularly sloppy puddle yielded some green sludge 
 
 splatter 
 
 crabbe and goyle caught some this time goyle hopped furiously on the spot trying to rub it out of his small dull eyes 
 
 it came from over there said malfoy wiping his face and staring at a spot some six feet to the left of harry 
 
 crabbe blundered forward his long arms outstretched like a zombie harry dodged around him picked up a stick and lobbed it at back harry doubled up with silent laughter as crabbe did a kind of pirouette in midair trying to see who had thrown it as ron was the only person crabbe could see it was ron he started toward but harry stuck out his leg crabbe stumbled and his huge flat foot caught the hem of cloak harry felt a great tug then the cloak slid off his face 
 
 for a split second malfoy stared at him 
 
 aaargh he yelled pointing at head then he turned tail and ran at breakneck speed back down the hill crabbe and goyle behind him 
 
 harry tugged the cloak up again but the damage was done 
 
 harry ron said stumbling forward and staring hopelessly at the point where harry had disappeared better run for it if malfoy tells anyone better get back to the castle quick 
 
 see you later said harry and without another word he tore back down the path toward hogsmeade 
 
 would malfoy believe what he had seen would anyone believe malfoy nobody knew about the invisibility cloak nobody except dumbledore stomach turned over dumbledore would know exactly what had happened if malfoy said anything 
 
 back into honeydukes back down the cellar steps across the stone floor through the trapdoor harry pulled off the cloak tucked it under his arm and ran flat out along the passagemalfoy would get back first how long would it take him to find a teacher panting a sharp pain in his side harry slow down until he reached the stone slide he would have to leave the cloak where it was it was too much of a giveaway in case malfoy had tipped off a teacher he hid it in a shadowy corner then started to climb fast as he could his sweaty hands slipping on the sides of the chute he reached the inside of the hump tapped it with his wand stuck his head through and hoisted himself out the hump closed and just as harry jumped out from behind the statue he heard quick footsteps approaching 
 
 it was snape he approached harry at a swift walk his black robes swishing then stopped in front of him 
 
 so he said 
 
 there was a look of suppressed triumph about him harry tried to look innocent all too aware of his sweaty face and his muddy hands which he quickly hid in his pockets 
 
 come with me potter said snape 
 
 harry followed him downstairs trying to wipe his hands clean on the inside of his robes without snape noticing they walked down the stairs to the dungeons and then into office 
 
 harry had been in here only once before and he had been in very serious trouble then too snape had acquired a few more slimy horrible things in jars since last time all standing on shelves behind his desk glinting in the firelight and adding to the threatening atmosphere 
 
 sit said snape 
 
 harry sat snape however remained standing 
 
 mr malfoy has just been to see me with a strange story potter said snape 
 
 harry say anything 
 
 he tells me that he was up by the shrieking shack when he ran into weasley apparently alone 
 
 still harry speak 
 
 mr malfoy states that he was standing talking to weasley when a large amount of mud hit him in the back of the head how do you think that could have happened 
 
 harry tried to look mildly surprised 
 
 i know professor 
 
 eyes were boring into it was exactly like trying to stare down a hippogriff harry tried hard not to blink 
 
 mr malfoy then saw an extraordinary apparition can you imagine what it might have been potter 
 
 no said harry now trying to sound innocently curious 
 
 it was your head potter floating in midair 
 
 there was a long silence 
 
 maybe better go to madam pomfrey said harry if seeing things like 
 
 what would your head have been doing in hogsmeade potter said snape softly your head is not allowed in hogsmeade no part of your body has permission to be in hogsmeade 
 
 i know that said harry striving to keep his face free of guilt or fear it sounds like having hallucin 
 
 malfoy is not having hallucinations snarled snape and he bent down a hand on each arm of chair so that their faces were a foot apart if your head was in hogsmeade so was the rest of you 
 
 been up in gryffindor tower said harry like you told 
 
 can anyone confirm that 
 
 harry say anything thin mouth curled into a horrible smile 
 
 so he said straightening up again everyone from the minister of magic downward has been trying to keep famous harry potter safe from sirius black but famous harry potter is a law unto himself let the ordinary people worry about his safety famous harry potter goes where he wants to with no thought for the consequences 
 
 harry stayed silent snape was trying to provoke him into telling the truth he going to do it snape had no proof yet 
 
 how extraordinarily like your father you are potter snape said suddenly his eyes glinting he too was exceedingly arrogant a small amount of talent on the quidditch field made him think he was a cut above the rest of us too strutting around the place with his friends and admirersthe resemblance between you is uncanny 
 
 my dad strut said harry before he could stop himself and neither do i 
 
 your father set much store by rules either snape went on pressing his advantage his thin face full of malice rules were for lesser mortals not quidditch his head was so swollen 
 
 shut up 
 
 harry was suddenly on his feet rage such as he had not felt since his last night in privet drive was coursing through him he care that face had gone rigid the black eyes flashing dangerously 
 
 what did you say to me potter 
 
 i told you to shut up about my dad harry yelled i know the truth all right he saved your life dumbledore told me you even be here if it for my dad 
 
 sallow skin had gone the color of sour milk 
 
 and did the headmaster tell you the circumstances in which your father saved my life he whispered or did he consider the details too unpleasant for precious delicate ears 
 
 harry bit his lip he know what had happened and want to admit it but snape seemed to have guessed the truth 
 
 i would hate for you to run away with a false idea of your father potter he said a terrible grin twisting his face have you been imagining some act of glorious heroism then let me correct you your saintly father and his friends played a highly amusing joke on me that would have resulted in my death if your father got cold feet at the last moment there was nothing brave about what he did he was saving his own skin as much as mine had their joke succeeded he would have been expelled from hogwarts 
 
 uneven yellowish teeth were bared 
 
 turn out your pockets potter he spat suddenly 
 
 harry move there was a pounding in his ears 
 
 turn out your pockets or we go straight to the headmaster pull them out potter 
 
 cold with dread harry slowly pulled out the bag of tricks and the map 
 
 snap picked up the bag 
 
 ron gave them to me said harry praying get a chance to tip ron off before snape saw him he brought them back from hogsmeade last time 
 
 indeed and been carrying them around ever since how very touchingand what is this 
 
 snape had picked up the map harry tried with all his might to keep his face impassive 
 
 spare bit of parchment he said with a shrug 
 
 snape turned it over his eyes on harry 
 
 surely you need such a very old piece of parchment he said why i just throw this away 
 
 his hand moved toward the fire 
 
 no harry said quickly 
 
 so said snape his long nostrils quivering is this another treasured gift from mr weasley or is it something else a letter perhaps written in invisible ink or instructions to get into hogsmeade without passing the dementors 
 
 harry blinked eyes gleamed 
 
 let me see let me see he muttered taking out his wand and smoothing the map out on his desk reveal your secret he said touching the wand to the parchment 
 
 nothing happened harry clenched his hands to stop them from shaking 
 
 show yourself snape said tapping the map sharply 
 
 it stayed blank harry was taking deep calming breaths 
 
 professor severus snape master of this school commands you to yield the information you conceal snape said hitting the map with his wand 
 
 as though an invisible hand were writing upon it words appeared on the smooth surface of the map 
 
 mooney presents his compliments to professor snape and begs him to keep his abnormally large nose out of other business 
 
 snape froze harry stared dumbstruck at the message but the map stop there more writing was appearing beneath the first 
 
 mr prongs agrees with mr mooney and would like to add that professor snape is an ugly git 
 
 it would have been very funny if the situation been so serious and there was more 
 
 mr padfoot would like to register his astonishment that an idiot like that ever became a professor 
 
 harry closed his eyes in horror when opened them the map had had its last word 
 
 mr wormtail bids professor snape good day and advises him to wash his hair the slimeball 
 
 harry waited for the blow to fall 
 
 so said snape softly see about this 
 
 he strode across to his fire seized a fistful of glittering powder from a jar on the fireplace and threw it into the flames 
 
 lupin snape called into the fire i want a word 
 
 utterly bewildered harry stared at the fire a large shape had appeared in it revolving very fast seconds later professor lupin was clambering out of the fireplace brushing ash off his shabby robes 
 
 you called severus said lupin mildly 
 
 i certainly did said snape his face contorted with fury as he strode back to his desk i have just asked potter to empty his pockets he was carrying this 
 
 snape pointed at the parchment on which the words of messrs moony wormtail padfoot and prongs were still shining an odd closed expression appeared on face 
 
 well said snape 
 
 lupin continued to stare at the map harry had the impression that lupin was doing some very quick thinking 
 
 well said snape again this parchment is plainly full of dark magic this is supposed to be your area of expertise lupin where do you imagine potter got such a thing 
 
 lupin looked up and by the merest in direction warned him not to interrupt 
 
 full of dark magic he repeated mildly do you really think so severus it looks to me as though it is merely a piece of parchment that insults anybody who reads it childish but surely not dangerous i imagine harry got it from a joke shop 
 
 indeed said snape his jaw had gone rigid with anger you think a joke shop could supply him with such a thing you think it more likely that he got it directly from the manufacturers 
 
 harry understand what snape was talking about nor apparently did lupin 
 
 you mean by mr wormtail or one of these people he said harry do you know any of these men 
 
 no said harry quickly 
 
 you see severus said lupin turning back to snape it looks like a zonko product to me 
 
 right on cue ron came bursting into the office he was completely out of breath and stopped just short of desk clutching the stitch in his chest and trying to speak 
 
 i gave harry that stuff he choked bought itin ages ago 
 
 well said lupin clapping his hands together and looking around cheerfully that seems to clear that up severus take this back shall i he folded the map and tucked it inside his robes harry ron come with me i need a word about my vampire essay excuse us severus 
 
 harry dare look at snape as they left his office he ron and lupin walked all the way back into the entrance hall before speaking then harry turned to lupin 
 
 professor i 
 
 i want to hear explanations said lupin shortly he glanced around the empty entrance hall and lowered his voice i happen to know that this map was confiscated by mr filch many years ago yes i know a map he said as harry and ron looked amazed i want to know how it fell into your possession i am however astounded that you hand it in particularly after what happened the last time a student left information about the castle lying around and i let you have it back harry 
 
 harry had expected that and was too keen for explanations to protest 
 
 why did snape think got it from the manufacturers 
 
 because lupin hesitated because these mapmakers would have wanted to lure you out of school think it extremely entertaining 
 
 do you know them said harry impressed 
 
 met he said shortly he was looking at harry more seriously than ever before 
 
 expect me to cover up for you again harry i cannot make you take sirius black seriously but i would have thought that what you have heard when the dementors draw near you would have had more of an effect on you your parents gave their lives to keep you alive harry a poor way to repay them gambling their sacrifice for a bag of magic tricks 
 
 he walked away leaving harry feeling worse by far than he had at any point in office slowly he and ron mounted the marble staircase as harry passed the witch he remembered the invisibility cloak it was still down there but he dare go and get it 
 
 my fault said ron abruptly i persuaded you to go right it was stupid we done it 
 
 he broke off they reached the corridor where the security trolls were pacing and hermione was walking toward them one look at her face convinced harry that she had heard what had happened his heart plummeted had she told professor mcgonagall 
 
 come to have a good gloat said ron savagely as she stopped in front of them or have you just been to tell on us 
 
 no said hermione she was holding a letter in her hands and her lip was trembling i just thought you ought to knowhagrid lost his case buckbeak is going to be executed 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the prisoner of azkaban 
 

lionfish nov chapter fifteen beauxbatons and durmstrangcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 early next morning harry woke with a plan fully formed in his mind as though his sleeping brain had been working on it all night he got up dressed in the pale dawn light left the dormitory without waking ron and went back down to the deserted common room here he took a piece of parchment from the table upon which his divination homework still lay and wrote the following letter 
 
 dear sirius 
 i reckon i just imagined my scar hurting i was half asleep when i wrote to you last time no point coming back fine here worry about me my head feels completely normal 
 harry 
 he then climbed out of the portrait hole up through the silent castle held up only briefly by peeves who tried to overturn a large vase on him halfway along the corridor finally arriving at the owlery which was situated at the top of west tower 
 
 the owlery was a circular stone room rather cold and drafty because none of the windows had glass in them the floor was entirely covered in straw owl droppings and the regurgitated skeletons of mice and voles hundreds upon hundreds of owls of every breed imaginable were nestled here on perches that rose right up to the top of the tower nearly all of them asleep though here and there a round amber eye glared at harry he spotted hedwig nestled between a barn owl and a tawny and hurried over to her sliding a little on the floor 
 
 it took him a while to persuade her to wake up and then to look at him as she kept shuffling around on her perch showing him her tail she was evidently still furious about his lack of gratitude the previous night in the end it was harry suggesting she might be too tired and that perhaps he would ask ron to borrow pigwidgeon that made her stick out her leg and allow him to tie the letter to it 
 
 just find him all right harry said stroking her back as he carried her on his arm to one of the holes in the wall before the dementors do 
 
 she nipped his finger perhaps rather harder than she would ordinarily have done but hooted softly in a reassuring sort of way all the same then she spread her wings and took off into the sunrise harry watched her fly out of sight with the familiar feeling of unease back in his stomach he had been so sure that reply would alleviate his worries rather than increasing them 
 
 that was a lie harry said hermione sharply over breakfast when he told her and ron what he had done you imagine your scar hurting and you know it 
 
 so what said harry not going back to azkaban because of me 
 
 drop it said ron sharply to hermione as she opened her mouth to argue some more and for once hermione heeded him and fell silent 
 
 harry did his best not to worry about sirius over the next couple of weeks true he could not stop himself from looking anxiously around every morning when the post owls arrived nor late at night before he went to sleep prevent himself from seeing horrible visions of sirius cornered by dementors down some dark london street but betweentimes he tried to keep his mind off his godfather he wished he still had quidditch to distract him nothing worked so well on a troubled mind as a good hard training session on the other hand their lessons were becoming more difficult and demanding than ever before particularly defense against the dark arts 
 
 to their surprise professor moody had announced that he would be putting the imperius curse on each of them in turn to demonstrate its power and to see whether they could resist its effects 
 
 but but you said illegal professor said hermione uncertainly as moody cleared away the desks with a sweep of his wand leaving a large clear space in the middle of the room you said to use it against another human was 
 
 dumbledore wants you taught what it feels like said moody his magical eye swiveling onto hermione and fixing her with an eerie unblinking stare if rather learn the hard way when putting it on you so they can control you completely fine by me excused off you go 
 
 he pointed one gnarled finger toward the door hermione went very pink and muttered something about not meaning that she wanted to leave harry and ron grinned at each other they knew hermione would rather eat bubotuber pus than miss such an important lesson 
 
 moody began to beckon students forward in turn and put the imperius curse upon them harry watched as one by one his classmates did the most extraordinary things under its influence dean thomas hopped three times around the room singing the national anthem lavender brown imitated a squirrel neville performed a series of quite astonishing gymnastics he would certainly not have been capable of in his normal state not one of them seemed to be able to fight off the curse and each of them recovered only when moody had removed it 
 
 potter moody growled you next 
 
 harry moved forward into the middle of the classroom into the space that moody had cleared of desks moody raised his wand pointed it at harry and said imperio 
 
 it was the most wonderful feeling harry felt a floating sensation as every thought and worry in his head was wiped gently away leaving nothing but a vague untraceable happiness he stood there feeling immensely relaxed only dimly aware of everyone watching him 
 
 and then he heard voice echoing in some distant chamber of his empty brain jump onto the deskjump onto the desk 
 
 harry bent his knees obediently preparing to spring 
 
 jump onto the desk 
 
 why though another voice had awoken in the back of his brain 
 
 stupid thing to do really said the voice 
 
 jump onto the desk 
 
 no i think i will thanks said the other voice a little more firmlyno i really want to 
 
 jump now 
 
 the next thing harry felt was considerable pain he had both jumped and tried to prevent himself from jumping the result was that smashed headlong into the desk knocking it over and by the feeling in his legs fractured both his kneecaps 
 
 now more like it growled voice and suddenly harry felt the empty echoing feeling in his head disappear he remembered exactly what was happening and the pain in his knees seemed to double 
 
 look at that you lotpotter fought he fought it and he damn near beat it try that again potter and the rest of you pay attention watch his eyes where you see it very good potter very good indeed have trouble controlling you 
 
 
 
 the way he talks harry muttered as he hobbled out of the defense against the dark arts class an hour later moody had insisted on putting harry through his paces four times in a row until harry could throw off the curse entirely think we were all going to be attacked any second 
 
 yeah i know said ron who was skipping on every alternate step he had had much more difficulty with the curse than harry though moody assured him the effects would wear off by lunchtime talk about paranoid ron glanced nervously over his shoulder to check that moody was definitely out of earshot and went on no wonder they were glad to get shot of him at the ministry did you hear him telling seamus what he did to that witch who shouted boo behind him on april fools day and when are we supposed to read up on resisting the imperius curse with everything else got to do 
 
 all the fourth years had noticed a definite increase in the amount of work they were required to do this term professor mcgonagall explained why when the class gave a particularly loud groan at the amount of transfiguration homework she had assigned 
 
 you are now entering a most important phase of your magical education she told them her eyes glinting dangerously behind her square spectacles your ordinary wizarding levels are drawing closer 
 
 we take till fifth year said dean thomas indignantly 
 
 maybe not thomas but believe me you need all the preparation you can get miss granger remains the only person in this class who has managed to turn a hedgehog into a satisfactory pincushion i might remind you that your pincushion thomas still curls up in fright if anyone approaches it with a pin 
 
 hermione who had turned rather pink again seemed to be trying not to look too pleased with herself 
 
 harry and ron were deeply amused when professor trelawney told them that they had received top marks for their homework in their next divination class she read out large portions of their predictions commending them for their unflinching acceptance of the horrors in store for them but they were less amused when she asked them to do the same thing for the month after next both of them were running out of ideas for catastrophes 
 
 meanwhile professor binns the ghost who taught history of magic had them writing weekly essays on the goblin rebellions of the eighteenth century professor snape was forcing them to research antidotes they took this one seriously as he had hinted that he might be poisoning one of them before christmas to see if their antidote worked professor flitwick had asked them to read three extra books in preparation for their lesson on summoning charms 
 
 even hagrid was adding to their workload the skrewts were growing at a remarkable pace given that nobody had yet discovered what they ate hagrid was delighted and as part of their project suggested that they come down to his hut on alternate evenings to observe the skrewts and make notes on their extraordinary behavior 
 
 i will not said draco malfoy flatly when hagrid had proposed this with the air of father christmas pulling an toy out of his sack i see enough of these foul things during lessons thanks 
 
 smile faded off his face 
 
 do wha yer told he growled or be takin a leaf outta professor hear yeh made a good ferret malfoy 
 
 the gryffindors roared with laughter malfoy flushed with anger but apparently the memory of punishment was still sufficiently painful to stop him from retorting harry ron and hermione returned to the castle at the end of the lesson in high spirits seeing hagrid put down malfoy was particularly satisfying especially because malfoy had done his very best to get hagrid sacked the previous year 
 
 when they arrived in the entrance hall they found themselves unable to proceed owing to the large crowd of students congregated there all milling around a large sign that had been erected at the foot of the marble staircase ron the tallest of the three stood on tiptoe to see over the heads in front of them and read the sign aloud to the other two 
 
 triwizard tournament 
 the delegations from beauxbatons and durmstrang will be arriving at on friday the th of october lessons will end half an hour early 
 brilliant said harry potions last thing on friday snape have time to poison us all 
 
 students will return their bags and books to their dormitories and assemble in front of the castle to greet our guests beforethe welcoming feast 
 only a week away said ernie macmillan of hufflepuff emerging from the crowd his eyes gleaming i wonder if cedric knows think go and tell him 
 
 cedric said ron blankly as ernie hurried off 
 
 diggory said harry he must be entering the tournament 
 
 that idiot hogwarts champion said ron as they pushed their way through the chattering crowd toward the staircase 
 
 not an idiot you just like him because he beat gryffindor at quidditch said hermione heard a really good student and a prefect 
 
 she spoke as though this settled the matter 
 
 you only like him because handsome said ron scathingly 
 
 excuse me i like people just because handsome said hermione indignantly 
 
 ron gave a loud false cough which sounded oddly like lockhart 
 
 the appearance of the sign in the entrance hall had a marked effect upon the inhabitants of the castle during the following week there seemed to be only one topic of conversation no matter where harry went the triwizard tournament rumors were flying from student to student like highly contagious germs who was going to try for hogwarts champion what the tournament would involve how the students from beauxbatons and durmstrang differed from themselves 
 
 harry noticed too that the castle seemed to be undergoing an cleaning several grimy portraits had been scrubbed much to the displeasure of their subjects who sat huddled in their frames muttering darkly and wincing as they felt their raw pink faces the suits of armor were suddenly gleaming and moving without squeaking and argus filch the caretaker was behaving so ferociously to any students who forgot to wipe their shoes that he terrified a pair of girls into hysterics 
 
 other members of the staff seemed oddly tense too 
 
 longbottom kindly do not reveal that you even perform a simple switching spell in front of anyone from durmstrang professor mcgonagall barked at the end of one particularly difficult lesson during which neville had accidentally transplanted his own ears onto a cactus 
 
 when they went down to breakfast on the morning of the thirtieth of october they found that the great hall had been decorated overnight enormous silk banners hung from the walls each of them representing a hogwarts house red with a gold lion for gryffiindor blue with a bronze eagle for ravenclaw yellow with a black badger for hufflepuff and green with a silver serpent for slytherin behind the teachers table the largest banner of all bore the hogwarts coat of arms lion eagle badger and snake united around a large letter h 
 
 harry ron and hermione sat down beside fred and george at the gryffindor table once again and most unusually they were sitting apart from everyone else and conversing in low voices ron led the way over to them 
 
 a bummer all right george was saying gloomily to fred but if he talk to us in person have to send him the letter after all or stuff it into his hand he avoid us forrever 
 
 avoiding you said ron sitting down next to them 
 
 wish you would said fred looking irritated at the interruption 
 
 a bummer ron asked george 
 
 having a nosy git like you for a brother said george 
 
 you two got any ideas on the triwizard tournament yet harry asked thought any more about trying to enter 
 
 i asked mcgonagall how the champions are chosen but she telling said george bitterly she just told me to shut up and get on with transfiguring my raccoon 
 
 wonder what the tasks are going to be said ron thoughtfully you know i bet we could do them harry done dangerous stuff before 
 
 not in front of a panel of judges you said fred mcgonagall says the champions get awarded points according to how well done the tasks 
 
 who are the judges harry asked 
 
 well the heads of the participating schools are always on the panel said hermione and everyone looked around at her rather surprised because all three of them were injured during the tournament of when a cockatrice the champions were supposed to be catching went on the rampage 
 
 she noticed them all looking at her and said with her usual air of impatience that nobody else had read all the books she had all in hogwarts a history though of course that not entirely reliable a revised history of hogwarts would be a more accurate title or a highly biased and selective history of hogwarts which glosses over the nastier aspects of the school 
 
 what are you on about said ron though harry thought he knew what was coming 
 
 said hermione her eyes flashing not once in over a thousand pages does hogwarts a history mention that we are all colluding in the oppression of a hundred slaves 
 
 harry shook his head and applied himself to his scrambled eggs his and lack of enthusiasm had done nothing whatsoever to curb determination to pursue justice for true both of them had paid two sickles for a badge but they had only done it to keep her quiet their sickles had been wasted however if anything they seemed to have made hermione more vociferous she had been badgering harry and ron ever since first to wear the badges then to persuade others to do the same and she had also taken to rattling around the gryffindor common room every evening cornering people and shaking the collecting tin under their noses 
 
 you do realize that your sheets are changed your fires lit your classrooms cleaned and your food cooked by a group of magical creatures who are unpaid and enslaved she kept saying fiercely 
 
 some people like neville had paid up just to stop hermione from glowering at them a few seemed mildly interested in what she had to say but were reluctant to take a more active role in campaigning many regarded the whole thing as a joke 
 
 ron now rolled his eyes at the ceiling which was flooding them all in autumn sunlight and fred became extremely interested in his bacon both twins had refused to buy a badge george however leaned in toward hermione 
 
 listen have you ever been down in the kitchens hermione 
 
 no of course not said hermione curtly i hardly think students are supposed to 
 
 well we have said george indicating fred loads of times to nick food and met them and happy they think got the best job in the world 
 
 because uneducated and brainwashed hermione began hotly but her next few words were drowned out by the sudden whooshing noise from overhead which announced the arrival of the post owls harry looked up at once and saw hedwig soaring toward him hermione stopped talking abruptly she and ron watched hedwig anxiously as she fluttered down onto shoulder folded her wings and held out her leg wearily 
 
 harry pulled off reply and offered hedwig his bacon rinds which she ate gratefully then checking that fred and george were safely immersed in further discussions about the triwizard tournament harry read out letter in a whisper to ron and hermione 
 
 nice try harry 
 back in the country and well hidden i want you to keep me posted on everything going on at hogwarts use hedwig keep changing owls and worry about me just watch out for yourself forget what i said about your scar 
 sirius 
 why have to keep changing owls ron asked in a low voice 
 
 attract too much attention said hermione at once she stands out a snowy owl that keeps returning to wherever hidingi mean not native birds are they 
 
 harry rolled up the letter and slipped it inside his robes wondering whether he felt more or less worried than before he supposed that sirius managing to get back without being caught was something he deny either that the idea that sirius was much nearer was reassuring at least he have to wait so long for a response every time he wrote 
 
 thanks hedwig he said stroking her she hooted sleepily dipped her beak briefly into his goblet of orange juice then took off again clearly desperate for a good long sleep in the owlery 
 
 there was a pleasant feeling of anticipation in the air that day nobody was very attentive in lessons being much more interested in the arrival that evening of the people from beauxbatons and durmstrang even potions was more bearable than usual as it was half an hour shorter when the bell rang early harry ron and hermione hurried up to gryffindor tower deposited their bags and books as they had been instructed pulled on their cloaks and rushed back downstairs into the entrance hall 
 
 the heads of houses were ordering their students into lines 
 
 weasley straighten your hat professor mcgonagall snapped at ron miss patil take that ridiculous thing out of your hair 
 
 parvati scowled and removed a large ornamental butterfly from the end of her plait 
 
 follow me please said professor mcgonagall first years in frontno pushing 
 
 they filed down the steps and lined up in front of the castle it was a cold clear evening dusk was falling and a pale moon was already shining over the forbidden forest harry standing between ron and hermione in the fourth row from the front saw dennis creevey positively shivering with anticipation among the other first years 
 
 nearly six said ron checking his watch and then staring down the drive that led to the front gates how reckon coming the train 
 
 i doubt it said hermione 
 
 how then broomsticks harry suggested looking up at the starry sky 
 
 i think sonot from that far away 
 
 a portkey ron suggested or they could apparate maybe allowed to do it under seventeen wherever they come from 
 
 you apparate inside the hogwarts grounds how often do i have to tell you said hermione impatiently 
 
 they scanned the darkening grounds excitedly but nothing was moving everything was still silent and quite as usual harry was starting to feel cold he wished hurry the foreign students were preparing a dramatic remembered what mr weasley had said back at the campsite before the quidditch world cup always the same we resist showing off when we get together 
 
 and then dumbledore called out from the back row where he stood with the other teachers 
 
 aha unless i am very much mistaken the delegation from beauxbatons approaches 
 
 where said many students eagerly all looking in different directions 
 
 there yelled a sixth year pointing over the forest 
 
 something large much larger than a broomstick or indeed a hundred broomsticks was hurtling across the deep blue sky toward the castle growing larger all the time 
 
 a dragon shrieked one of the first years losing her head completely 
 
 be a flying house said dennis creevey 
 
 guess was the gigantic black shape skimmed over the treetops of the forbidden forest and the lights shining from the castle windows hit it they saw a gigantic powderblue carriage the size of a large house soaring toward them pulled through the air by a dozen winged horses all palominos and each the size of an elephant 
 
 the front three rows of students drew backward as the carriage hurtled ever lower coming in to land at a tremendous speed then with an almighty crash that made neville jump backward onto a slytherin fifth foot the horses hooves larger than dinner plates hit the ground a second later the carriage landed too bouncing upon its vast wheels while the golden horses tossed their enormous heads and rolled large fiery red eyes 
 
 harry just had time to see that the door of the carriage bore a coat of arms two crossed golden wands each emitting three stars before it opened 
 
 a boy in pale blue robes jumped down from the carriage bent forward fumbled for a moment with something on the carriage floor and unfolded a set of golden steps he sprang back respectfully then harry saw a shining black shoe emerging from the inside of the carriage a shoe the size of a sled followed almost immediately by the largest woman he had ever seen in his life the size of the carriage and of the horses was immediately explained a few people gasped 
 
 harry had only ever seen one person as large as this woman in his life and that was hagrid he doubted whether there was an inch difference in their heights yet somehow maybe simply because he was used to hagrid this woman now at the foot of the steps and looking around at the waiting crowd seemed even more unnaturally large as she stepped into the light flooding from the entrance hall she was revealed to have a handsome face large black eyes and a rather beaky nose her hair was drawn back in a shining knob at the base of her neck she was dressed from head to foot in black satin and many magnificent opals gleamed at her throat and on her thick fingers 
 
 dumbledore started to clap the students following his lead broke into applause too many of them standing on tiptoe the better to look at this woman 
 
 her face relaxed into a gracious smile and she walked forward toward dumbledore extending a glittering hand dumbledore though tall himself had barely to bend to kiss it 
 
 my dear madame maxime he said welcome to hogwarts 
 
 said madame maxime in a deep voice i ope i find you well 
 
 in excellent form i thank you said dumbledore 
 
 my pupils said madame maxime waving one of her enormous hands carelessly behind her 
 
 harry whose attention had been focused completely upon madame maxime now noticed that about a dozen boys and girls all by the look of them in their late teens had emerged from the carriage and were now standing behind madame maxime they were shivering which was unsurprising given that their robes seemed to be made of fine silk and none of them were wearing cloaks a few had wrapped scarves and shawls around their heads from what harry could see of them they were standing in madame enormous shadow they were staring up at hogwarts with apprehensive looks on their faces 
 
 as karkaroff arrived yet madame maxime asked 
 
 he should be here any moment said dumbledore would you like to wait here and greet him or would you prefer to step inside and warm up a trifle 
 
 warm up i think said madame maxime but ze orses 
 
 our care of magical creatures teacher will be delighted to take care of them said dumbledore the moment he has returned from dealing with a slight situation that has arisen with some of his other er charges 
 
 skrewts ron muttered to harry grinning 
 
 my steeds require er forceful andling said madame maxime looking as though she doubted whether any care of magical creatures teacher at hogwarts could be up to the job zey are very strong 
 
 i assure you that hagrid will be well up to the job said dumbledore smiling 
 
 very well said madame maxime bowing slightly will you please inform zis agrid zat ze orses drink only whiskey 
 
 it will be attended to said dumbledore also bowing 
 
 come said madame maxime imperiously to her students and the hogwarts crowd parted to allow her and her students to pass up the stone steps 
 
 how big reckon horses are going to be seamus finnigan said leaning around lavender and parvati to address harry and ron 
 
 well if any bigger than this lot even hagrid be able to handle them said harry if he been attacked by his skrewts wonder up with them 
 
 maybe escaped said ron hopefully 
 
 oh say that said hermione with a shudder imagine that lot loose on the grounds 
 
 they stood shivering slightly now waiting for the durmstrang party to arrive most people were gazing hopefully up at the sky 
 
 for a few minutes the silence was broken only by madame huge horses snorting and stamping but then 
 
 can you hear something said ron suddenly 
 
 harry listened a loud and oddly eerie noise was drifting toward them from out of the darkness a muffled rumbling and sucking sound as though an immense vacuum cleaner were moving along a riverbed 
 
 the lake yelled lee jordan pointing down at it look at the lake 
 
 from their position at the top of the lawns overlooking the grounds they had a clear view of the smooth black surface of the water except that the surface was suddenly not smooth at all some disturbance was taking place deep in the center great bubbles were forming on the surface waves were now washing over the muddy banks and then out in the very middle of the lake a whirlpool appeared as if a giant plug had just been pulled out of the floor 
 
 what seemed to be a long black pole began to rise slowly out of the heart of the whirlpooland then harry saw the rigging 
 
 a mast he said to ron and hermione 
 
 slowly magnificently the ship rose out of the water gleaming in the moonlight it had a strangely skeletal look about it as though it were a resurrected wreck and the dim misty lights shimmering at its portholes looked like ghostly eyes finally with a great sloshing noise the ship emerged entirely bobbing on the turbulent water and began to glide toward the bank a few moments later they heard the splash of an anchor being thrown down in the shallows and the thud of a plank being lowered onto the bank 
 
 people were disembarking they could see their silhouettes passing the lights in the portholes all of them harry noticed seemed to be built along the lines of crabbe and goylebut then as they drew nearer walking up the lawns into the light streaming from the entrance hall he saw that their bulk was really due to the fact that they were wearing cloaks of some kind of shaggy matted fur but the man who was leading them up to the castle was wearing furs of a different sort sleek and silver like his hair 
 
 dumbledore he called heartily as he walked up the slope how are you my dear fellow how are you 
 
 blooming thank you professor karkaroff dumbledore replied karkaroff had a fruity unctuous voice when he stepped into the light pouring from the front doors of the castle they saw that he was tall and thin like dumbledore but his white hair was short and his goatee finishing in a small curl did not entirely hide his rather weak chin when he reached dumbledore he shook hands with both of his own 
 
 dear old hogwarts he said looking up at the castle and smiling his teeth were rather yellow and harry noticed that his smile did not extend to his eyes which remained cold and shrewd how good it is to be here how come along into the warmthyou mind dumbledore viktor has a slight head cold 
 
 karkaroff beckoned forward one of his students as the boy passed harry caught a glimpse of a prominent curved nose and thick black eyebrows he need the punch on the arm ron gave him or the hiss in his ear to recognize that profile

lionfish nov chapter fifteen the high inquisitorcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 they had expected to have to comb daily prophet carefully next morning to find the article percy had mentioned in his letter however the departing delivery owl had barely cleared the top of the milk jug when hermione let out a huge gasp and flattened the newspaper to reveal a large photograph of dolores umbridge smiling widely and blinking slowly at them from beneath the headline 
 
 ministry seeks educational reform 
 
 dolores umbridge appointed 
 
 first ever high inquisitor 
 
 high inquisitor said harry darkly his piece of toast slipping from his fingers what does that mean 
 
 hermione read aloud 
 
 in a surprise move last night the ministry of magic passed new legislation giving itself an unprecedented level of control at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry 
 
 the minister has been growing uneasy about at hogwarts for some time said junior assistant to the minister percy weasley he is now responding to concerns voiced by anxious parents who feel the school may be moving in a direction they do not approve of 
 
 this is not the first time in recent weeks that the minister cornelius fudge has used new laws to effect improvements at the wizarding school as recently as th august educational decree number was passed to ensure that in the event of the current headmaster being unable to provide a candidate for a teaching post the ministry should select an appropriate person 
 
 how dolores umbridge came to be appointed to the teaching staff at hogwarts said weasley last night dumbledore find anyone so the minister put in umbridge and of course been an immediate success 
 
 been a what said harry loudly 
 
 wait more said hermione grimly 
 
 an immediate success totally revolutionising the teaching of defence against the dark arts and providing the minister with feedback about really happening at hogwarts 
 
 it is this last function that the ministry has now formalised with the passing of educational decree number which creates the new position of hogwarts high inquisitor 
 
 this is an exciting new phase in the plan to get to grips with what some are calling the falling standards at hogwarts said weasley the inquisitor will have powers to inspect her fellow educators and make sure that they are coming up to scratch professor umbridge has been offered this position in addition to her own teaching post and we are delighted to say that she has accepted 
 
 the new moves have received enthusiastic support from parents of students at hogwarts 
 
 i feel much easier in my mind now that i know dumbledore is being subjected to fair and objective evaluation said mr lucius malfoy speaking from his wiltshire mansion last night many of us with our best interests at heart have been concerned about some of eccentric decisions in the last few years and are glad to know that the ministry is keeping an eye on the situation 
 
 among those eccentric decisions are undoubtedly the controversial staff appointments previously described in this newspaper which have included the employment of werewolf remus lupin rubeus hagrid and delusional moody 
 
 rumours abound of course that albus dumbledore once supreme mugwump of the international confederation of wizards and chief warlock of the wizengamot is no longer up to the task of managing the prestigious school of hogwarts 
 
 i think the appointment of the inquisitor is a first step towards ensuring that hogwarts has a headmaster in whom we can all repose our confidence said a ministry insider last night 
 
 wizengamot elders griselda marchbanks and tiberius ogden have resigned in protest at the introduction of the post of inquisitor to hogwarts 
 
 hogwarts is a school not an outpost of cornelius office said madam marchbanks this is a further disgusting attempt to discredit albus dumbledore for a full account of madam alleged links to subversive goblin groups turn to page seventeen 
 
 hermione finished reading and looked across the table at the other two 
 
 so now we know how we ended up with umbridge fudge passed this educational decree and forced her on us and now given her the power to inspect the other teachers hermione was breathing fast and her eyes were very bright i believe this outrageous 
 
 i know it is said harry he looked down at his right hand clenched on the and saw the faint white outline of the words umbridge had forced him to cut into his skin 
 
 but a grin was unfurling on face 
 
 what said harry and hermione together staring at him 
 
 oh i wait to see mcgonagall inspected said ron happily umbridge know hit her 
 
 well come on said hermione jumping up better get going if inspecting class we want to be late 
 
 but professor umbridge was not inspecting their history of magic lesson which was just as dull as the previous monday nor was she in dungeon when they arrived for double potions where moonstone essay was handed back to him with a large spiky black d scrawled in an upper corner 
 
 i have awarded you the grades you would have received if you presented this work in your owl said snape with a smirk as he swept among them passing back their homework this should give you a realistic idea of what to expect in the examination 
 
 snape reached the front of the class and turned on his heel to face them 
 
 the general standard of this homework was abysmal most of you would have failed had this been your examination i expect to see a great deal more effort for this essay on the various varieties of venom antidotes or i shall have to start handing out detentions to those dunces who get a d 
 
 he smirked as malfoy sniggered and said in a carrying whisper some people got a d ha 
 
 harry realised that hermione was looking sideways to see what grade he had received he slid his moonstone essay back into his bag as quickly as possible feeling that he would rather keep that information private 
 
 determined not to give snape an excuse to tail him this lesson harry read and reread every line of instructions on the blackboard at least three times before acting on them his strengthening solution was not precisely the clear turquoise shade of but it was at least blue rather than pink like and he delivered a flask of it to desk at the end of the lesson with a feeling of mingled defiance and relief 
 
 well that as bad as last week was it said hermione as they climbed the steps out of the dungeon and made their way across the entrance hall towards lunch and the homework go too badly either did it 
 
 when neither ron nor harry answered she pressed on i mean all right i expect the top grade not if marking to owl standard but a pass is quite encouraging at this stage you say 
 
 harry made a noise in his throat 
 
 of course a lot can happen between now and the exam got plenty of time to improve but the grades getting now are a sort of baseline they something we can build on 
 
 they sat down together at the gryffindor table 
 
 obviously have been thrilled if got an o 
 
 hermione said ron sharply if you want to know what grades we got ask 
 
 i meanwell if you want to tell me 
 
 i got a p said ron ladling soup into his bowl happy 
 
 well nothing to be ashamed of said fred who had just arrived at the table with george and lee jordan and was sitting down on right nothing wrong with a good healthy p 
 
 but said hermione p stand for 
 
 poor yeah said lee jordan still better than d it dreadful 
 
 harry felt his face grow warm and faked a small coughing fit over his roll when he emerged from this he was sorry to find that hermione was still in full flow about owl grades 
 
 so top o for outstanding she was saying and then a 
 
 no e george corrected her e for exceeds expectations and always thought fred and i got e in everything because we exceeded expectations just by turning up for the exams 
 
 they all laughed except hermione who ploughed on so after e a for acceptable and the last pass grade it 
 
 yep said fred dunking an entire roll in his soup transferring it to his mouth and swallowing it whole 
 
 then you get p for poor ron raised both his arms in mock d for dreadful 
 
 and then t george reminded her 
 
 t asked hermione looking appalled even lower than a d what on earth does t stand for 
 
 troll said george promptly 
 
 harry laughed again though he was not sure whether or not george was joking he imagined trying to conceal from hermione that he had received in all his owls and immediately resolved to work harder from now on 
 
 you lot had an inspected lesson yet fred asked them 
 
 no said hermione at once have you 
 
 just now before lunch said george charms 
 
 what was it like harry and hermione asked together 
 
 fred shrugged 
 
 not that bad umbridge just lurked in the corner making notes on a clipboard you know what like he treated her like a guest seem to bother him at all she say much asked alicia a couple of questions about what the classes are normally like alicia told her they were really good that was it 
 
 i see old flitwick getting marked down said george he usually gets everyone through their exams all right 
 
 you got this afternoon fred asked harry 
 
 trelawney 
 
 a t if ever i saw one 
 
 and umbridge herself 
 
 well be a good boy and keep your temper with umbridge today said george do her nut if you miss any more quidditch practices 
 
 but harry did not have to wait for defence against the dark arts to meet professor umbridge he was pulling out his dream diary in a seat at the very back of the shadowy divination room when ron elbowed him in the ribs and looking round he saw professor umbridge emerging through the trapdoor in the floor the class which had been talking cheerily fell silent at once the abrupt fall in the noise level made professor trelawney who had been wafting about handing out copies of the dream oracle look round 
 
 good afternoon professor trelawney said professor umbridge with her wide smile you received my note i trust giving the time and date of your inspection 
 
 professor trelawney nodded curtly and looking very disgruntled turned her back on professor umbridge and continued to give out books still smiling professor umbridge grasped the back of the nearest armchair and pulled it to the front of the class so that it was a few inches behind professor seat she then sat down took her clipboard from her flowery bag and looked up expectantly waiting for the class to begin 
 
 professor trelawney pulled her shawls tight about her with slightly trembling hands and surveyed the class through her hugely magnifying lenses 
 
 we shall be continuing our study of prophetic dreams today she said in a brave attempt at her usual mystic tones though her voice shook slightly divide into pairs please and interpret each others latest visions with the aid of the oracle 
 
 she made as though to sweep back to her seat saw professor umbridge sitting right beside it and immediately veered left towards parvati and lavender who were already deep in discussion about most recent dream 
 
 harry opened his copy of the dream oracle watching umbridge covertly she was already making notes on her clipboard after a few minutes she got to her feet and began to pace the room in wake listening to her conversations with students and posing questions here and there harry bent his head hurriedly over his book 
 
 think of a dream quick he told ron in case the old toad comes our way 
 
 i did it last time ron protested your turn you tell me one 
 
 oh i dunno said harry desperately who could not remember dreaming anything at all over the last few days say i dreamed i was drowning snape in my cauldron yeah do 
 
 ron chortled as he opened his dream oracle 
 
 ok got to add your age to the date you had the dream the number of letters in the subject would that be drowning or cauldron or snape 
 
 it matter pick any of them said harry chancing a glance behind him professor umbridge was now standing at professor shoulder making notes while the divination teacher questioned neville about his dream diary 
 
 what night did you dream this again ron said immersed in calculations 
 
 i dunno last night whenever you like harry told him trying to listen to what umbridge was saying to professor trelawney they were only a table away from him and ron now professor umbridge was making another note on her clipboard and professor trelawney was looking extremely put out 
 
 now said umbridge looking up at trelawney been in this post how long exactly 
 
 professor trelawney scowled at her arms crossed and shoulders hunched as though wishing to protect herself as much as possible from the indignity of the inspection after a slight pause in which she seemed to decide that the question was not so offensive that she could reasonably ignore it she said in a deeply resentful tone nearly sixteen years 
 
 quite a period said professor umbridge making a note on her clipboard so it was professor dumbledore who appointed you 
 
 right said professor trelawney shortly 
 
 professor umbridge made another note 
 
 and you are a of the celebrated seer cassandra trelawney 
 
 yes said professor trelawney holding her head a little higher 
 
 another note on the clipboard 
 
 but i think correct me if i am mistakenthat you are the first in your family since cassandra to be possessed of second sight 
 
 these things often skiperthree generations said professor trelawney 
 
 professor toadlike smile widened 
 
 of course she said sweetly making yet another note well if you could just predict something for me then and she looked up enquiringly still smiling 
 
 professor trelawney stiffened as though unable to believe her ears i understand you she said clutching convulsively at the shawl around her scrawny neck 
 
 like you to make a prediction for me said professor umbridge very clearly 
 
 harry and ron were not the only people now watching and listening sneakily from behind their books most of the class were staring transfixed at professor trelawney as she drew herself up to her lull height her beads and bangles clinking 
 
 the inner eye does not see upon command she said in scandalised tones 
 
 i see said professor umbridge softly making yet another note on her clipboard 
 
 ibutbut wait said professor trelawney suddenly in an attempt at her usual ethereal voice though the mystical effect was ruined somewhat by the way it was shaking with anger i i think i do see something something that concerns you why i sense something something dark some grave peril 
 
 professor trelawney pointed a shaking finger at professor umbridge who continued to smile blandly at her eyebrows raised 
 
 i am afraid i am afraid that you are in grave danger professor trelawney finished dramatically 
 
 there was a pause professor umbridge surveyed professor trelawney 
 
 right she said softly scribbling on her clipboard once more well if really the best you can do 
 
 she turned away leaving professor trelawney standing rooted to the spot her chest heaving harry caught eye and knew that ron was thinking exactly the same as he was they both knew that professor trelawney was an old fraud but on the other hand they loathed umbridge so much that they felt very much on sideuntil she swooped down on them a few seconds later that is 
 
 well she said snapping her long fingers under nose uncharacteristically brisk let me see the start made on your dream diary please 
 
 and by the time she had interpreted dreams at the top of her voice all of which even the ones that involved eating porridge apparently foretold a gruesome and early death he was feeling much less sympathetic towards her all the while professor umbridge stood a few feet away making notes on that clipboard and when the bell rang she descended the silver ladder first and was waiting for them all when they reached their defence against the dark arts lesson ten minutes later 
 
 she was humming and smiling to herself when they entered the room harry and ron told hermione who had been in arithmancy exactly what had happened in divination while they all took out their copies of defensive magical theory but before hermione could ask any questions professor umbridge had called them all to order and silence fell 
 
 wands away she instructed them all with a smile and those people who had been hopeful enough to take them out sadly returned them to their bags as we finished chapter one last lesson i would like you all to turn to page nineteen today and commence chapter two common defensive theories and their derivation there will be no need to talk 
 
 still smiling her wide smile she sat down at her desk the class gave an audible sigh as it turned as one to page nineteen harry wondered dully whether there were enough chapters in the book to keep them reading through all this years lessons and was on the point of checking the contents page when he noticed that hermione had her hand in the air again 
 
 professor umbridge had noticed too and what was more she seemed to have worked out a strategy for just such an eventuality instead of trying to pretend she had not noticed hermione she got to her feet and walked around the front row of desks until they were face to face then she bent down and whispered so that the rest of the class could not hear what is it this time miss granger 
 
 already read chapter two said hermione 
 
 well then proceed to chapter three 
 
 read that too read the whole book 
 
 professor umbridge blinked but recovered her poise almost instantly 
 
 well then you should be able to tell me what slinkhard says about in chapter fifteen 
 
 he says that are improperly named said hermione promptly he says is just a name people give their jinxes when they want to make them sound more acceptable 
 
 professor umbridge raised her eyebrows and harry knew she was impressed against her will 
 
 but i disagree hermione continued 
 
 professor eyebrows rose a little higher and her gaze became distinctly colder 
 
 you disagree she repeated 
 
 yes i do said hermione who unlike umbridge was not whispering but speaking in a clear carrying voice that had by now attracted the attention of the rest of the class mr slinkhard like jinxes does he but i think they can be very useful when used defensively 
 
 oh you do do you said professor umbridge forgetting to whisper and straightening up well afraid it is mr opinion and not yours that matters within this classroom miss granger 
 
 but hermione began 
 
 that is enough said professor umbridge she walked back to the front of the class and stood before them all the jauntiness she had shown at the beginning of the lesson gone miss granger i am going to take five points from gryffindor house 
 
 there was an outbreak of muttering at this 
 
 what for said harry angrily 
 
 you get involved hermione whispered urgently to him 
 
 for disrupting my class with pointless interruptions said professor umbridge smoothly i am here to teach you using a method that does not include inviting students to give their opinions on matters about which they understand very little your previous teachers in this subject may have allowed you more licence but as none of themwith the possible exception of professor quirrell who did at least appear to have restricted himself to subjectswould have passed a ministry inspection 
 
 yeah quirrell was a great teacher said harry loudly there was just that minor drawback of him having lord voldemort sticking out of the back of his head 
 
 this pronouncement was followed by one of the loudest silences harry had ever heard then 
 
 i think another detentions would do you some good mr potter said umbridge sleekly 
 
 the cut on the back of hand had barely healed and by the following morning it was bleeding again he did not complain during the detention he was determined not to give umbridge the satisfaction over and over again he wrote i must not tell lies and not a sound escaped his lips though the cut deepened with every letter 
 
 the very worst part of this second worth of detentions just as george had predicted reaction she cornered him just as he arrived at the gryffindor table for breakfast on tuesday and shouted so loudly that professor mcgonagall came sweeping down upon the pair of them from the staff table 
 
 miss johnson how dare you make such a racket in the great hall five points from gryffindor 
 
 but professor gone and landed himself in detention again 
 
 this potter said professor mcgonagall sharply rounding on harry detention from whom 
 
 from professor umbridge muttered harry not meeting professor beady eyes 
 
 are you telling me she said lowering her voice so that the group of curious ravenclaws behind them could not hear that after the warning i gave you last monday you lost your temper in professor class again 
 
 yes harry muttered speaking to the floor 
 
 potter you must get a grip on yourself you are heading for serious trouble another five points from gryffindor 
 
 butwhat professor no harry said furious at this injustice already being punished by her why do you have to take points as well 
 
 because detentions do not appear to have any effect on you whatsoever said professor mcgonagall tartly no not another word of complaint potter and as for you miss johnson you will confine your shouting matches to the quidditch pitch in future or risk losing the team captaincy 
 
 professor mcgonagall strode back towards the staff table angelina gave harry a look of deepest disgust and stalked away upon which he flung himself on to the bench beside ron fuming 
 
 taken points off gryffindor because having my hand sliced open every night how is that fair how 
 
 i know mate said ron sympathetically tipping bacon on to plate bang out of order 
 
 hermione however merely rustled the pages of her daily prophet and said nothing 
 
 you think mcgonagall was right do you said harry angrily to the picture of cornelius fudge obscuring face 
 
 i wish she taken points from you but i think right to warn you not to lose your temper with umbridge said voice while fudge gesticulated forcefully from the front page clearly giving some kind of speech 
 
 harry did not speak to hermione all through charms but when they entered transfiguration he forgot about being cross with her professor umbridge and her clipboard were sitting in a corner and the sight of her drove the memory of breakfast right out of his head 
 
 excellent whispered ron as they sat down in their usual seats see umbridge get what she deserves 
 
 professor mcgonagall marched into the room without giving the slightest indication that she knew professor umbridge was there 
 
 that will do she said and silence fell immediately mr finnigan kindly come here and hand back the homeworkmiss brown please take this box of be silly girl they hurt youand hand one to each student 
 
 hem hem said professor umbridge employing the same silly little cough she had used to interrupt dumbledore on the first night of term professor mcgonagall ignored her seamus handed back essay harry took it without looking at him and saw to his relief that he had managed an a 
 
 right then everyone listen closelydean thomas if you do that to the mouse again i shall put you in detentionmost of you have now successfully vanished your snails and even those who were left with a certain amount of shell have got the gist of the spell today we shall be 
 
 hem hem said professor umbridge 
 
 yes said professor mcgonagall turning round her eyebrows so close together they seemed to form one long severe line 
 
 i was just wondering professor whether you received my note telling you of the date and time of your inspec 
 
 obviously i received it or i would have asked you what you are doing in my classroom said professor mcgonagall turning her back firmly on professor umbridge many of the students exchanged looks of glee as i was saying today we shall be practising the altogether more difficult vanishment of mice now the vanishing spell 
 
 hem hem 
 
 i wonder said professor mcgonagall in cold fury turning on professor umbridge how you expect to gain an idea of my usual teaching methods if you continue to interrupt me you see i do not generally permit people to talk when i am talking 
 
 professor umbridge looked as though she had just been slapped in the face she did not speak but straightened the parchment on her clipboard and began scribbling furiously 
 
 looking supremely unconcerned professor mcgonagall addressed the class once more 
 
 as i was saying the vanishing spell becomes more difficult with the complexity of the animal to be vanished the snail as an invertebrate does not present much of a challenge the mouse as a mammal offers a much greater one this is not therefore magic you can accomplish with your mind on your dinner so you know the incantation let me see what you can do 
 
 how she can lecture me about not losing my temper with umbridge harry muttered to ron under his breath but he was grinninghis anger with professor mcgonagall had quite evaporated 
 
 professor umbridge did not follow professor mcgonagall around the class as she had followed professor trelawney perhaps she realised professor mcgonagall would not permit it she did however take many more notes while sitting in her corner and when professor mcgonagall finally told them all to pack away she rose with a grim expression on her face 
 
 well a start said ron holding up a long wriggling and dropping it back into the box lavender was passing around 
 
 as they filed out of the classroom harry saw professor umbndge approach the teachers desk he nudged ron who nudged hermione in turn and the three of them deliberately fell back to eavesdrop 
 
 how long have you been teaching at hogwarts professor umbridge asked 
 
 years this december said professor mcgonagall brusquely snapping her bag shut 
 
 professor umbridge made a note 
 
 very well she said you will receive the results of your inspection in ten days time 
 
 i can hardly wait said professor mcgonagall in a coldly indifferent voice and she strode off towards the door hurry up you three she added sweeping harry ron and hermione before her 
 
 harry could not help giving her a faint smile and could have sworn he received one in return 
 
 he had thought that the next time he would see umbridge would be in his detention that evening but he was wrong when they walked down the lawns towards the forest for care of magical creatures they found her and her clipboard waiting for them beside professor 
 
 you do not usually take this class is that correct harry heard her ask as they arrived at the trestle table where the group of captive bowtruckles were scrabbling around for woodlice like so many living twigs 
 
 quite correct said professor hands behind her back and bouncing on the balls of her feet i am a substitute teacher standing in for professor hagrid 
 
 harry exchanged uneasy looks with ron and hermione malfoy was whispering with crabbe and goyle he would surely love this opportunity to tell tales on hagrid to a member of the ministry 
 
 hmm said professor umbridge dropping her voice though harry could still hear her quite clearly i wonderthe headmaster seems strangely reluctant to give me any information on the mattercan you tell me what is causing professor very extended leave of absence 
 
 harry saw malfoy look up eagerly and watch umbridge and closely 
 
 fraid i said professor breezily know anything more about it than you do got an owl from dumbledore would i like a couple of weeks teaching work i accepted as much as i know well shall i get started then 
 
 yes please do said professor umbridge scribbling on her clipboard 
 
 umbridge took a different tack in this class and wandered amongst the students questioning them on magical creatures most people were able to answer well and spirits lifted somewhat at least the class was not letting hagrid down 
 
 overall said professor umbridge returning to professor side after a lengthy interrogation of dean thomas how do you as a temporary member of staffan objective outsider i suppose you might sayhow do you find hogwarts do you feel you receive enough support from the school management 
 
 oh yes excellent said professor heartily yes very happy with the way things are run very happy indeed 
 
 looking politely incredulous umbridge made a tiny note on her clipboard and went on and what are you planning to cover with this class this yearassuming of course that professor hagrid does not return 
 
 oh take them through the creatures that most often come up in owl said professor not much left to studied unicorns and nifflers i thought cover porlocks and kneazles make sure they can recognise crups and knarls you know 
 
 well you seem to know what doing at any rate said professor umbridge making a very obvious tick on her clipboard harry did not like the emphasis she put on you and liked it even less when she put her next question to goyle now i hear there have been injuries in this class 
 
 goyle gave a stupid grin malfoy hastened to answer the question 
 
 that was me he said i was slashed by a hippogriff 
 
 a hippogriff said professor umbridge now scribbling frantically 
 
 only because he was too stupid to listen to what hagrid told him to do said harry angrily 
 
 both ron and hermione groaned professor umbridge turned her head slowly in direction 
 
 another detention i think she said softly well thank you very much professor i think all i need here you will be receiving the results of your inspection within ten days 
 
 jolly good said professor and professor umbridge set off back across the lawn to the castle 
 
 it was nearly midnight when harry left office that night his hand now bleeding so severely that it was staining the scarf he had wrapped around it he expected the common room to be empty when he returned but ron and hermione had sat up waiting for him he was pleased to see them especially as hermione was disposed to be sympathetic rather than critical 
 
 here she said anxiously pushing a small bowl of yellow liquid towards him soak your hand in that a solution of strained and pickled murtlap tentacles it should help 
 
 harry placed his bleeding aching hand into the bowl and experienced a wonderful feeling of relief crookshanks curled around his legs purring loudly then leapt into his lap and settled down 
 
 thanks he said gratefully scratching behind ears with his left hand 
 
 i still reckon you should complain about this said ron in a low voice 
 
 no said harry flatly 
 
 mcgonagall would go nuts if she knew 
 
 yeah she probably would said harry dully and how long do you reckon take umbridge to pass another decree saying anyone who complains about the high inquisitor gets sacked immediately 
 
 ron opened his mouth to retort but nothing came out and after a moment he closed it again defeated 
 
 an awful woman said hermione in a small voice know i was just saying to ron when you came in got to do something about her 
 
 i suggested poison said ron grimly 
 
 no i mean something about what a dreadful teacher she is and how not going to learn any defence from her at all said hermione 
 
 well what can we do about that said ron yawning s too late it got the job here to stay make sure of that 
 
 well said hermione tentatively you know i was thinking today she shot a slightly nervous look at harry and then plunged on i was thinking that maybe the come when we should justjust do it ourselves 
 
 do what ourselves said harry suspiciously still floating his hand in the essence of murtlap tentacles 
 
 welllearn defence against the dark arts ourselves said hermione 
 
 come off it groaned ron you want us to do extra work realise harry and i are behind on homework again and only the second week 
 
 but this is much more important than homework said hermione 
 
 harry and ron goggled at her 
 
 i think there was anything in the universe more important than homework said ron 
 
 be silly of course there is said hermione and harry saw with an ominous feeling that her face was suddenly alight with the kind of fervour that spew usually inspired in her about preparing ourselves like harry said in first lesson for waiting for us out there about making sure we really can defend ourselves if we learn anything for a whole year 
 
 we do much by ourselves said ron in a defeated voice i mean all right we can go and look jinxes up in the library and try and practise them i suppose 
 
 no i agree gone past the stage where we can just learn things out of books said hermione we need a teacher a proper one who can show us how to use the spells and correct us if going wrong 
 
 if talking about lupin harry began 
 
 no no not talking about lupin said hermione too busy with the order and anyway the most we could see him is during hogsmeade weekends and not nearly often enough 
 
 who then said harry frowning at her 
 
 hermione heaved a very deep sigh 
 
 it obvious she said talking about 
 
 there was a silence a light night breeze rattled the windowpanes behind ron and the fire guttered 
 
 about me what said harry 
 
 talking about you teaching us defence against the dark arts 
 
 harry stared at her then he turned to ron ready to exchange the exasperated looks they sometimes shared when hermione elaborated on schemes like spew to consternation however ron did not look exasperated 
 
 he was frowning slightly apparently thinking then he said an idea 
 
 an idea said harry 
 
 you said ron teaching us to do it 
 
 but 
 
 harry was grinning now sure the pair of them were pulling his leg 
 
 but not a teacher i 
 
 harry the best in the year at defence against the dark arts said hermione 
 
 me said harry now grinning more broadly than ever no not beaten me in every test 
 
 actually i said hermione coolly you beat me in our third yearthe only year we both sat the test and had a teacher who actually knew the subject but not talking about test results harry think what done 
 
 how mean 
 
 you know what not sure i want someone this stupid teaching me ron said to hermione smirking slightly he turned to harry 
 
 think he said pulling a face like goyle concentrating uh first yearyou saved the stone from 
 
 but that was luck said harry it skill 
 
 second year ron interrupted you killed the basilisk and destroyed riddle 
 
 yeah but if fawkes turned up i 
 
 third year said ron louder still you fought off about a hundred dementors at once 
 
 you know that was a fluke if the 
 
 last year ron said almost shouting now you fought off again 
 
 listen to me said harry almost angrily because ron and hermione were both smirking now just listen to me all right it sounds great when you say it like that but all that stuff was lucki know what i was doing half the time i plan any of it i just did whatever i could think of and i nearly always had help 
 
 ron and hermione were still smirking and harry felt his temper rise he even sure why he was feeling so angry 
 
 sit there grinning like you know better than i do i was there i he said heatedly i know what went on all right and i get through any of that because i was brilliant at defence against the dark arts i got through it all because because help came at the right time or because i guessed rightbut i just blundered through it all i have a clue what i was doingstop laughing 
 
 the bowl of murtlap essence fell to the floor and smashed he became aware that he was on his feet though he remember standing up crookshanks streaked away under a sofa ron and smiles had vanished 
 
 you know what of never had to face him have you you think just memorising a bunch of spells and throwing them at him like in class or something the whole time sure you know nothing between you and dying except your ownyour own brain or guts or whateverlike you can think straight when you know about a nanosecond from being murdered or tortured or watching your friends die never taught us that in their classes what like to deal with things like thatand you two sit there acting like a clever little boy to be standing here alive like diggory was stupid like he messed upyou just get it that could just as easily have been me it would have been if voldemort needed me 
 
 we saying anything like that mate said ron looking aghast we having a go at diggory we got the wrong end of the 
 
 he looked helplessly at hermione whose face was stricken 
 
 harry she said timidly you see this this is exactly why we need you we need to know what like facing him facing 
 
 it was the first time she had ever said name and it was this more than anything else that calmed harry still breathing hard he sank back into his chair becoming aware as he did so that his hand was throbbing horribly again he wished he had not smashed the bowl of murtlap essence 
 
 well think about it said hermione quietly please 
 
 harry could not think of anything to say he was feeling ashamed of his outburst already he nodded hardly aware of what he was agreeing to 
 
 hermione stood up 
 
 well off to bed she said in a voice that was clearly as natural as she could make it erm night 
 
 ron had got to his feet too 
 
 coming he said awkwardly to harry 
 
 yeah said harry in in a minute just clear this up 
 
 he indicated the smashed bowl on the floor ron nodded and left 
 
 reparo harry muttered pointing his wand at the broken pieces of china they flew back together good as new but there was no returning the murtlap essence to the bowl 
 
 he was suddenly so tired he was tempted to sink back into his armchair and sleep there but instead he forced himself to his feet and followed ron upstairs his restless night was punctuated once more by dreams of long corridors and locked doors and he awoke next day with his scar prickling again 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix 
 

lionfish nov chapter fifteen the unbreakable vowcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 snow was swirling against the icy windows once more christmas was approaching fast hagrid had already singlehandedly delivered the usual twelve christmas trees to the great hall garlands of holly and tinsel had been twisted around the banisters of the stairs everlasting candles glowed from inside the helmets of suits of armor and great bunches of mistletoe had been hung at intervals along the corridors large groups of girls tended to converge underneath the mistletoe bunches every time harry went past which caused blockages in the corridors fortunately however frequent nighttime wanderings had given him an unusually good knowledge of the secret passageways so that he was often without too much difficulty to navigate routes between classes 
 
 ron who might once have found the necessity of these detours excuse for jealousy rather than hilarity simply roared with laughter about it all although harry much preferred this new laughing joking ron to the moody aggressive model he had been enduring for the last few weeks the improved ron came at a heavy price firstly harry had to put up with the frequent presence of lavender brown who seemed to regard any moment that she was not kissing ron as a moment wasted and secondly harry found himself once more the best friend of two people who seemed unlikely ever to speak to each other again 
 
 ron whose hands and forearms still bore scratches and cuts from bird attack was taking a defensive and resentful tone 
 
 she complain he told harry she snogged krum so found out someone wants to snog me too well a free country i done anything wrong 
 
 harry did not answer but pretended to be absorbed in the book they were supposed to have read before charms next morning quintessence a quest determined as he was to remain friends with both ron and hermione he was spending a lot of time with his mouth shut tight 
 
 i never promised hermione anything ron mumbled i mean all right i was going to go to christmas party with her but she never said just as friends a free agent 
 
 harry turned a page of quintessence aware that ron was watching him voice trailed away in mutters barely audible over the loud crackling of the fire though harry thought he caught the words krum and complain again 
 
 schedule was so full that harry could only talk to her properly in the evenings when ron was in any case so tightly wrapped around lavender that he did not notice what harry was doing hermione refused to sit in the common room while ron was there so harry generally joined her in the library which meant that their conversations were held in whispers 
 
 at perfect liberty to kiss whomever he likes said hermione while the librarian madam pince prowled the shelves behind them i really care less 
 
 she raised her quill and dotted an i so ferociously that she punctured a hole in her parchment harry said nothing he thought his voice might soon vanish from the lack of use he bent a little lower over advanced and continued to make notes on everlasting elixirs occasionally pausing to decipher the useful additions to libatius text 
 
 and incidentally said hermione after a few moments you need to be careful 
 
 for the last time said harry speaking in a slightly hoarse tone after of an silence i am not giving back this book learned more from the prince than snape or slughorn have taught me in 
 
 not talking about your stupid prince said hermione giving his book a nasty look as though it had been rude to her talking about earlier i went into the girls bathroom just before i came in here and there were about a dozen girls in there including that romilda vane trying to decide how to slip you a love potion all hoping going to get you to take them to party and thay all seem to have bought fred and love potions which afraid to say probably work 
 
 why you confiscate them then demanded harry it seemed extraordinary that mania for upholding the rules could have abandoned her at this crucial juncture 
 
 they have the potions with them in the bathroom said hermione scornfully they were just discussing tactics as i doubt the prince she gave the book another scornful look could dream up an antidote for a dozen different love potions at once just invite someone to go with you stop all the others thinking still got a chance tomorrow night getting desperate 
 
 there anyone i want to invite mumbled harry who was still not trying to think about ginny any more than he could help despite the fact the fact that she kept cropping up in his dreams in ways that made him devoutly thankful that ron could not perform legilimency 
 
 well just be careful what you drink because romilda vane looked like she meant business said hermione grimly 
 
 she hitched up the long roll of parchment on which she was writing her arithmancy essay and continued to scratch away with her quill harry watched her with his mind a long way away 
 
 hang on a moment he said slowly i thought filch had banned anything bought at wizard wheezes 
 
 and when has anyone ever paid attention to what filch has banned asked hermione still concentrating on her essay 
 
 but i thought all the owls were being searched so how come these girls are able to bring love potions into the school 
 
 fred and george send them disguised as perfumes and cough potions said hermione part of their owl order service 
 
 you know a lot about it 
 
 hermione gave him the kind of nasty look she had just given his copy of advanced 
 
 it was all on the back of the bottles they showed ginny and me in the summer she said coldly i go around putting potions in drinks or pretending too either which is just as bad 
 
 yeah well never mind that said harry quickly the point is filch is being fooled he these girls are getting stuff into the school disguised as something else so why malfoy have brought the necklace into the school 
 
 oh harry not that again 
 
 come on why not demanded harry 
 
 look sighed hermione secrecy sensors detect jinxes curses and concealment charms they used to find dark magic and dark objects have picked up a powerful curse like the one in the necklace within seconds but something just been put in the wrong bottle registerand anyway love potions dark or dangerous 
 
 easy for you to say muttered harry thinking of romilda vane 
 
 so it would be down to filch to realise it a cough potion and not a very good wizard i doubt he can tell one potion from 
 
 hermione stopped dead harry had heard it too somebody had moved close behind them among the dark bookshelves they waited and a moment later the countenance of madam pince appeared around the corner her sunken cheeks her skin like parchment and her long hooked nose illuminated unflatteringly by the lamp she was carrying 
 
 the library is now closed she said mind you return anything you have borrowed to the correctwhat have you been doing to that book you depraved boy 
 
 it the mine said harry hastily snatching his copy of advanced off the table as she lunged at it with a clawlike hand 
 
 despoiled she hissed desecrated befouled 
 
 just a book been written on said harry tugging it out of her grip 
 
 she looked as though she might have a seizure hermione who had hastily packed her things grabbed harry by the arm and frogmarched him away 
 
 ban you from the library if not careful why did you have to bring that stupid book 
 
 not my fault barking mad hermione or think she overheard you being rude about filch always thought there might be something between them 
 
 oh ha ha 
 
 enjoying the fact that they could speak normally again they made their way along the deserted corridors back to the common room arguing whether or not filch and madam pince were secretly in love with each other 
 
 baubles said harry to the fat lady this being the new festive password 
 
 same to you said the fat lady with a roguish grin and she swung forward to admit them 
 
 hi harry said romilda vane the moment he had climbed through the portrait hole fancy a gillywater 
 
 hermione gave him a look over her shoulder 
 
 no thanks said harry quickly i like it much 
 
 well take these anyway said romilda thrusting a box into his hands chocolate cauldrons got firewhiskey in them my gran sent them to me but i like them 
 
 ohrightthanks a lot said harry who could not think what else to say just going over here with 
 
 he hurried off behind hermione his voice tailing away feebly 
 
 told you said hermione succinctly sooner you ask someone sooner all leave you alone and you can 
 
 but her face suddnly turned blank she had just spotted ron and lavender who were intertwined in the same armchair 
 
 well goodnight harry said hermione though it was only seven in the evening and she left for the girls dormitory without another word 
 
 harry went to bed comforting himself that there was only one more day of lessons to struggle through plus party after which he and ron would depart together for the burrow it now seemed impossible that ron and hermione would make up with each other before the holidays began but perhaps somehow the break would give them time to calm down think better of their behavior 
 
 but his hopes were not high and they sank still lower after enduring a transfiguration lesson with them both next day they had just embarked upon the immensely difficult topic of human transfiguration working in front of mirrors they were supposed to be changing the color of their own eyebrows hermione laughed unkindly at disastrous first attempt during which he somehow managed to give himself a spectacular handlebar mustache ron retaliated by doing a cruel but accurate impression of hermione jumping up and down in her seat every time professor mcgonagall asked a question which lavender and parvati found deeply amusing and which reduced hermione to the verge of tears again she raced out of the classroom on the bell leaving half her things behind harry deciding that her need was greater than just now scooped up her remaining possessions and followed her 
 
 he finally tracked her down as she emerged from a bathroom on the floor below she was accompanied by luna lovegood who was patting her vaguely on the back 
 
 oh hello harry said luna did you know one of your eyebrows is bright yellow 
 
 hi luna hermione you left your stuff 
 
 he held out her books 
 
 oh yes said hermione in a choked voice taking her things and turning away quickly to hide the fact she was wiping her eyes with her pencil case thank you harry well better get going 
 
 and she hurried off without ever giving harry any time to offer words of comfort though admittedly he could not think of any 
 
 a bit upset said luna i thought at first it was moaning myrtle in there but it turned out to be hermione she said something about ron weasley 
 
 yeah had a row said harry 
 
 he says funny things sometimes he said luna as they set off down the corridor together but he can be a bit unkind i noticed that last year 
 
 i said harry luna was demonstrating her usual knack of speaking uncomfortable truths he had never met anyone quite like her so have you had a good term 
 
 oh been all right said luna a bit lonely without the been nice though she stopped two boys in our transfiguration class calling me loony the other day 
 
 how would you like to come to party with me tonight 
 
 the words were out of mouth before he could stop them he heard himself say them as though it were a stranger speaking 
 
 luna turned her protuberant eyes to him in surprise 
 
 party with you 
 
 yeah said harry supposed to bring guests so i thought you might like i mean he was keen to make his intentions perfectly clear i mean just as friends you know but if you want to 
 
 he was already that she want to 
 
 oh no love to go with you as friends said luna beaming as he had never seen her beam before ever asked me to a party before as a friend is that why you dyed your eyebrow for the party should i do mine too 
 
 no said harry firmly that was a mistake get hermione to put it right for me so meet you in the entrance hall at eight then 
 
 aha screamed a voice from overhead and both of them jumped unnoticed by either of them they had just passed underneath peeves who was hanging upside down from a chandelier and grinning maliciously at them 
 
 potty asked loony to go to the party potty lurves loony potty luuuuuurves looooony 
 
 and he zoomed away cackling and shrieking potty loves loony 
 
 nice to keep these things private said harry and sure enough in no time at all the whole school seemed to know that harry potter was taking luna lovegood to party 
 
 you taken anyone said ron in disbelief over dinner anyone and you chose loony lovegood 
 
 call her that ron snapped ginny pausing behind harry on her way to join friends really glad taking her harry so excited 
 
 and she moved on down the table to sit with dean harry tried to feel pleased that ginny was glad he was taking luna to the party but could not quite manage it a long way along the table hermione was sitting alone playing with her stew harry noticed ron looking at her furtively 
 
 you could say sorry suggested harry bluntly 
 
 what and get attacked by another flock of canaries muttered ron 
 
 what did you have to imitate her for 
 
 she laughed at my mustache 
 
 so did i it was the stupidest thing ever seen 
 
 but ron did not seem to have heard lavender had just arrived with parvati squeezing herself in between harry and ron lavender flung her arms around neck 
 
 hi harry said parvati who like harry looked faintly embarrassed and bored by the behavior of their two friends 
 
 hi said harry you staying at hogwarts then i heard your parents wanted you to leave 
 
 i managed to talk them out of it for the time being said parvati that katie thing really freaked them out but as there been anything since oh hi hermione 
 
 parvati positively beamed harry could tell that she was feeling guilty for having laughed at hermione in transfiguration he looked around and saw that hermione was beaming back if possible even more brightly girls were very strange sometimes 
 
 hi parvati said hermione ignoring ron and lavender completely are you going to party tonight 
 
 no invite said parvati gloomily love to go though it sounds like going to be really good going you 
 
 yes meeting cormac at eight and 
 
 there was a noise like a plunger being withdrawn from a blocked sink and ron surfaced hermione acted as though she had not seen or heard anything 
 
 going up to the party together 
 
 cormac said parvati cormac mclaggen you mean 
 
 right said hermione sweetly the one who almost she put a great deal of emphasis on the word became gryffindor keeper 
 
 are you going out with him then asked parvati 
 
 you know said harmione with a most giggle 
 
 no said parvati looking positively agog at this piece of gossip wow you like your quidditch players you first krum then mclaggen 
 
 i like really good quidditch players hermione corrected her still smiling well see you got to go and get ready for the party 
 
 she left at once lavender and parvati put their heads together to discuss this new development with everything they had ever heard about mclaggen and all they had ever guessed about hermione ron looked strangely blank and said nothing harry was left to ponder in silence the depths to which girls would sink to get revenge 
 
 when he arrived in the entrance hall at eight that night he found an unusually large number of girls lurking there all of whom seemed to be staring at him resentfully as he approached luna she was wearing a set of spangled silver robes that were attracting a certain amount of giggles from the onlookers but otherwise she looked quite nice harry was glad in any case that she had left off her radish earrings her necklace and her spectrespecs 
 
 hi he said shall we get going then 
 
 oh yes she said happily where is the party 
 
 office said harry leading her up the marble staircase away from all the staring and muttering did you hear supposed to be a vampire coming 
 
 rufus scrimgeour asked luna 
 
 iwhat said harry disconcerted you mean the minister of magic 
 
 yes a vampire said luna father wrote a very long article about it when scrimgeour first took over from cornelius fudge but he was forced not to publish by somebody from the ministry obviously they want the truth to get out 
 
 harry who thought it most unlikely that rufus scrimgeour was a vampire but who was used to luna repeating her bizarre views as though they were fact did not reply they were already approaching office and the sounds of laughter music and loud conversation were growing louder with every step they took 
 
 whether it had been built that way or because he had used magical trickery to make it so office was much larger than the usual study the ceiling and walls had been draped with emerald crimson and gold hangings so that it looked as though they were all inside a vast tent the room was crowded and stuffy and bathed in the red light cast by an ornate golden lamp dangling from the center of the ceiling in which real fairies were fluttering each a brilliant speck of light loud singing accompanied by what sounded like mandolins issued from a distant corner a haze of pipe smoke hung over several elderly warlocks deep in conversation and a number of were negotiating their way squeakily through the forest of knees obscured by the heavy silver platters of food they were bearing so that they looked like little roving tables 
 
 harry boomed slughorn almost as soon as harry and luna had squeezed in through the door come in come in so many people like you to meet 
 
 slughorn was wearing a tasseled velvet hat to match his smoking jacket gripping arm so tightly he might have been hoping to disapparate with him slughorn led him purposefully into the party harry seized hand and dragged her along with him 
 
 harry like you to meet eldred worple an old student of mine author of blood brothers my life amongst the vampiresand of course his friend sanguini 
 
 worple who was a small stout bespectacled man grabbed hand and shook it enthusiastically the vampire sanguini who was tall and emaciated with dark shadows under his eyes merely nodded he looked rather bored a gaggle of girls was standing close to him looking curious and excited 
 
 harry potter i am simply delighted said worple peering up into face i was saying to professor slughorn only the other day where is the biography of harry potter for which we have all been waiting 
 
 er said harry were you 
 
 just as modest as horace described said worple but seriously his manner changed it became suddenly i would be delighted to write it myself people are craving to know more about you dear boy craving if you were prepared to grant me a few interviews say in four or sessions why we could have the book finished within months and all with very little effort on your part i assure youask sanguini here if it quite sanguini stay here added worple suddenly stern for the vampire had been edging toward the nearby group of girls a rather hungry look in his eye here have a pasty said worple seizing one from a passing elf and stuffing it into hand before turning his attention back to harry 
 
 my dear boy the gold you could make you have no idea 
 
 definitely not interested said harry firmly and just seen a friend of mine sorry 
 
 he pulled luna after him into the crowd he had indeed just seen a long mane of brown hair disappear between what looked like two members of the weird sisters 
 
 hermione hermione 
 
 harry there you are thank goodness hi luna 
 
 happened to you asked harry for hermione looked distinctly disheveled rather as though she had just fought her way out of a thicket of snare 
 
 oh just escapedi mean just left cormac she said under the mistletoe she added in explanation as harry continued to look questioningly at her 
 
 serves you right for coming with him he told her severely 
 
 i thought annoy ron most said hermione dispassionately i debated for a while about zacharias smith but i thought on the whole 
 
 you considered smith said harry revolted 
 
 yes i did and starting to wish chosen him mclaggen makes grawp look a gentleman go this way be able to see him coming so tall 
 
 the three of them made their way over to the other side of the room scooping up goblets of mead on the way realizing too late that professor trelawney was standing there alone 
 
 hello said luna politely to professor trelawney 
 
 good evening my dear said professor trelawney focusing upon luna with some difficulty harry could smell cooking sherry again i seen you in my classes lately 
 
 no got firenze this year said luna 
 
 oh of course said professor trelawney with an angry drunken titter or dobbin as i prefer to think of him you would have thought would you not that now i am returned to the school professor dumbledore might have got rid of the horse but no we share classes an insult frankly an insult do you know 
 
 professor trelawney seemed too tipsy to have recognized harry under cover of her furious criticisms of firenze harry drew closer to hermione and said let me get something straight are you planning to tell ron that you interfered at keeper tryouts 
 
 hermione raised her eyebrows 
 
 do you really think stoop that low 
 
 harry looked at her shrewdly 
 
 hermione if you can ask out mclaggen 
 
 a difference said hermione with dignity got no plans to tell ron anything about what might or might not have happened at keeper tryouts 
 
 good said harry fervently because just fall apart again and lose the next match 
 
 quidditch said hermione angrily is that all boys care about cormac asked me one single question about myself no just been treated to a hundred great saves made by cormac mclaggen ever sinceoh no here he comes 
 
 she moved so fast it was as though she had disapparated one moment she was there the next she had squeezed between two guffawing witches and vanished 
 
 seen hermione asked mclaggen forcing his way through the throng a minute later 
 
 no sorry said harry and he turned quickly to join in conversation forgetting for a split second to whom she was talking 
 
 harry potter said professor trelawney in deep vibrant tones noticing him for the first time 
 
 oh hello said harry unenthusiastically 
 
 my dear boy she said in a very carrying whisper the rumors the stories the chosen one of course i have known for a very long time the omens were never good harry but why have you not returned to divination for you of all people the subject is of the utmost importance 
 
 ah sybill we all think our most important said a loud voice and slughorn appeared at professor other side his face very red his velvet hat a little askew a glass of mead in one hand and an enormous mince pie in the other but i think ever known such a natural at potions said slughorn regarding harry with a fond if bloodshot eye instinctive you knowlike his mother only ever taught a few with this kind of ability i can tell you that sybillwhy even severus 
 
 and to horror slughorn threw out an arm and seemed to scoop snape out of thin air toward them 
 
 stop skulking and come and join us severus hiccuped slughorn happily i was just talking about exceptional some credit must go to you of course you taught him for five years 
 
 trapped with arm around his shoulders snape looked down his hooked nose at harry his black eyes narrowed 
 
 funny i never had the impression that i managed to teach potter anything at all 
 
 well then natural ability shouted slughorn you should have seen what he gave me first lesson draught of living deathnever had a student produce finer on a first attempt i think even you severus 
 
 really said snape quietly his eyes still boring into harry who felt a certain disquiet the last thing he wanted was for snape to start investigating the source of his newfound brilliance at potions 
 
 remind me what other subjects taking harry asked slughorn 
 
 defense against the dark arts charms transfiguration herbology 
 
 all the subjects required in short for an auror said snape with the faintest sneer 
 
 yeah well what like to do said harry defiantly 
 
 and a great one make too boomed slughorn 
 
 i think you should be an auror harry said luna unexpectedly everybody looked at her the aurors are part of the rotfang conspiracy i thought everyone knew that planning to bring down the ministry of magic from within using a combination of dark magic and gum disease 
 
 harry inhaled half his mead up his nose as he started to laugh really it had been worth bringing luna just for this emerging from his goblet coughing sopping wet but still grinning he saw something calculated to raise his spirits even higher draco malfoy being dragged by the ear toward them by argus filch 
 
 professor slughorn wheezed filch his jowls aquiver and the maniacal light of in his bulging eyes i discovered this boy lurking in an upstairs corridor he claims to have been invited to your party and to have been delayed in setting out did you issue him with an invitation 
 
 malfoy pulled himself free of grip looking furious 
 
 all right i invited he said angrily i was trying to gatecrash happy 
 
 no not said filch a statement at complete odds with the glee on his face in trouble you are the headmaster say that prowling is out unless got permission he eh 
 
 all right argus all right said slughorn waving a hand christmas and not a crime to want to come to a party just this once forget any punishment you may stay draco 
 
 expression of outraged disappointment was perfectly predictable but why harry wondered watching him did malfoy look almost equally unhappy and why was snape looking at malfoy as though both angry and was it possible a little afraid 
 
 but almost before harry had registered what he had seen filch had turned and shuffled away muttering under his breath malfoy had composed his face into a smile and was thanking slughorn for his generosity and face was smoothly inscrutable again 
 
 nothing nothing said slughorn waving away thanks i did know your grandfather after all 
 
 he always spoke very highly of you sir said malfoy quickly said you were the best ever known 
 
 harry stared at malfoy it was not the that intrigued him he had watched malfoy do that to snape for a long time it was the fact that malfoy did after all look a little ill this was the first time he had seen malfoy close up for ages he now saw that malfoy had dark shadows under his eyes and a distinctly grayish tinge to his skin 
 
 like a word with you draco said snape suddenly 
 
 now severus said slughorn hiccuping again christmas be too hard 
 
 his head of house and i shall decide how hard or otherwise to be said snape curtly follow me draco 
 
 they left snape leading the way malfoy looking resentful harry stood there for a moment irresolute then said be back in a bit lunaerbathroom 
 
 all right she said cheerfully and he thought he heard her as he hurried off into the crowd resume the subject of the rotfang conspiracy with professor trelawney who seemed sincerely interested 
 
 it was easy once out of the party to pull his invisibility cloak out of his pocket and throw it over himself for the corridor was quite deserted what was more difficult was finding snape and malfoy harry ran down the corridor the noise of his feet masked by the music and loud talk still issuing from office behind him perhaps snape had taken malfoy to his office in the dungeons or perhaps he was escorting him back to the slytherin common room harry pressed his ear against door after door as he dashed down the corridor until with a great jolt of excitement he crouched down to the keyhole of the last classroom in the corridor and heard voices 
 
 cannot afford mistakes draco because if you are expelled 
 
 i have anything to do with it all right 
 
 i hope you are telling the truth because it was both clumsy and foolish already you are suspected of having a hand in it 
 
 who suspects me said malfoy angrily for the last time i do it okay that bell girl had an enemy no one knows look at me like that i know what doing not stupid but it worki can stop you 
 
 there was a pause and then snape said quietly ah aunt bellatrix has been teaching you occlumency i see what thoughts are you trying to conceal from your master draco 
 
 not trying to conceal anything from him i just want you butting in 
 
 harry pressed his ear still more closely against the keyhole what had happened to make malfoy speak to snape like thissnape toward whom he had always shown respect even liking 
 
 so that is why you have been avoiding me this term you have feared my interference you realize that had anybody else failed to come to my office when i had told them repeatedly to be there draco 
 
 so put me in detention report me to dumbledore jeered malfoy 
 
 there was another pause then snape said you know perfectly well that i do not wish to do either of those things 
 
 better stop telling me to come to your office then 
 
 listen to me said snape his voice so low now that harry had to push his ear very hard against the keyhole to hear i am trying to help you i swore to your mother i would protect you i made the unbreakable vow draco 
 
 looks like have to break it then because i need your protection my job he gave it to me and doing it got a plan and going to work just taking a bit longer than i thought it would 
 
 what is your plan 
 
 none of your business 
 
 if you tell me what you are trying to do i can assist you 
 
 i have all the assistance i need thanks not alone 
 
 you were certainly alone tonight which was foolish in the extreme wandering the corridors without lookouts or backup these are elementary mistakes 
 
 i had crabbe and goyle with me if you put them in detention 
 
 keep your voice down spat snape for voice had risen excitedly if your friends crabbe and goyle intend to pass their defense against the dark arts this time around they will need to work a little harder than they are doing at pres 
 
 what does it matter said malfoy defense against the dark all just a joke it an act like any of us need protecting against the dark arts 
 
 it is an act that is crucial to success draco said snape where do you think i would have been all these years if i had not known how to act now listen to me you are being incautious wandering around at night getting yourself caught and if you are placing your reliance in assistants like crabbe and goyle 
 
 not the only ones got other people on my side better people 
 
 then why not confide in me and i can 
 
 i know what up to you want to steal my glory 
 
 there was another pause then snape said coldly you are speaking like a child i quite understand that your capture and imprisonment has upset you but 
 
 harry had barely a warning he heard footsteps on the other side of the door and flung himself out of the way just as it burst open malfoy was striding away down the corridor past the open door of office around the distant corner and out of sight 
 
 hardly daring to breathe harry remained crouched down as snape emerged slowly from the classroom his expression unfathomable he returned to the party harry remained on the floor hidden beneath the cloak his mind racing 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the half blood prince 
 

lionfish nov chapter fifteen the goblins revengecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 early next morning before the other two were awake harry left the tent to search the woods around them for the oldest most gnarled and tree he could find there in its shadows he buried moodys eye and marked the spot by gouging a small cross in the bark with his wand it was not much but harry felt that would have much preferred this to being stuck on dolores umbridges door then he returned to the tent to wait for the others to wake and discuss what they were going to do next 
 
 harry and hermione felt that it was best not to stay anywhere too long and ron agreed with the sole proviso that their next move took them within reach of a bacon sandwich hermione therefore removed the enchantments she had placed around the clearing while harry and ron obliterated all the marks and impressions on the ground that might show they had camped there then they disapparated to the outskirts of a small market town 
 
 once they had pitched the tent in the shelter of a small copse of trees and surrounded it with freshly cast defensive enchantments harry ventured out under the invisibility cloak to find sustenance this however did not go as planned he had barely entered the town when an unnatural chill a descending mist and a sudden darkening of the skies made him freeze where he stood 
 
 but you can make a brilliant patronus protested ron when harry arrived back at the tent empty handed out of breath and mouthing the single word dementors 
 
 i couldnt make one he panted clutching the stitch in his side wouldnt come 
 
 their expressions of consternation and disappointment made harry feel ashamed it had been a nightmarish experience seeing the dementors gliding out of the must in the distance and realizing as the paralyzing cold choked his lungs and a distant screaming filled his ears that he was not going to be able to protect himself it had taken all harrys willpower to uproot himself from the spot and run leaving the eyeless dementors to glide amongst the muggles who might not be able to see them but would assuredly feel the despair they cast wherever they went 
 
 so we still havent got any food 
 
 shut up ron snapped hermione harry what happened why do you think you couldnt make your patronus you managed perfectly yesterday 
 
 i dont know 
 
 he sat low in one of perkinss old armchairs feeling more humiliated by the moment he was afraid that something had gone wrong inside him yesterday seemed a long time ago today me might have been thirteen years old again the only one who collapsed on the hogwarts express 
 
 ron kicked a chair leg 
 
 what he snarled at hermione im starving all ive had since i bled half to death is a couple of toadstools 
 
 you go and fight your way through the dementors then said harry stung 
 
 i would but my arms in a sling in case you hadnt noticed 
 
 thats convenient 
 
 and whats that supposed to c 
 
 of course cried hermione clapping a hand to her forehead and startling both of them into silence harry give me the locket come on she said impatiently clicking her fingers at him when he did not react the horcrux harry youre still wearing it 
 
 she held out her hands and harry lifted the golden chain over his head the moment it parted contact with harrys skin he felt oddly light he had not even realized that he was clammy or that there was a heavy weight pressing on his stomach until both sensations lifted 
 
 better asked hermione 
 
 yeah loads better 
 
 harry she said crouching down in front of him and using the kind of voice he associated with visiting the very sick you dont think youve been possessed do you 
 
 what no he said defensively i remember everything weve done while ive bee wearing it i wouldnt know what id done if id been possessed would i ginny told me there were times when she couldnt remember anything 
 
 hmm said hermione looking down at the heavy locket well maybe we ought not to wear it we can just keep it in the tent 
 
 we are not leaving that horcrux lying around harry stated firmly if we lose it if it gets stolen c 
 
 oh all right all right said hermione and she placed it around her own neck and tucked it out of sight down the front of her shirt but well take turns wearing it so nobody keeps it on too long 
 
 great said ron irritably and now weve sorted that out can we please get some food 
 
 fine but well go somewhere else to find it said hermione with half a glance at harry theres no point staying where we know dementors are swooping around 
 
 in the end they settled down for the night in a far flung field belonging to a lonely farm from which they had managed to obtain eggs and bread 
 
 its not stealing is it asked hermione in a troubled voice as they devoured scrambled eggs on toast not if i left some money under the chicken coo 
 
 ron rolled his eyes and said with his cheeks bulging oo worry oo much elax 
 
 and indeed it was much easier to relax when they were comfortably well fed the argument about the dementors was forgotten in laughter that night and harry felt cheerful even hopeful as he took the first of the three night watches 
 
 this was their first encounter with the fact that a full stomach meant good spirits an empty one bickering and gloom harry was least surprised by this because be had suffered periods of near starvation at the dursleys hermione bore up reasonably well on those nights when they managed to scavenge nothing but berries or stale biscuits her temper perhaps a little shorter than usual and her silences dour ron however had always been used to three delicious meals a day courtesy of his mother or of the hogwarts and hunger made him both unreasonable and irascible whenever lack of food coincided with rons turn to wear the horcrux he became downright unpleasant 
 
 so where next was his constant refrain he did not seem to have any ideas himself but expected harry and hermione to come up with plans while he sat and brooded over the low food supplies accordingly harry and hermione spent fruitless hours trying to decide where they might find the other horcruxes and how to destroy the one they already got their conversations becoming increasingly repetitive as they got no new information 
 
 as dumbledore had told harry that he believed voldemort had hidden the horcruxes in places important to him they kept reciting in a sort of dreary litany those locations they knew that voldemort had lived or visited the orphanage where he had been born and raised hogwarts where he had been educated borgin and burks where he had worked after completing school then albania where he had spent his years of exile these formed the basis of their speculations 
 
 yeah lets go to albania shouldnt take more than an afternoon to search an entire country said ron sarcastically 
 
 there cant be anything there hed already made five of his horcruxes before he went into exile and dumbledore was certain the snake is the sixth said hermione we know the snakes not in albania its usually with vol c 
 
 didnt i ask you to stop say that 
 
 fine the snake is usually with c happy 
 
 not particularly 
 
 i cant see him hiding anything at borgin and burkes said harry who had made this point many times before but said it again simply to break the nasty silence borgin and burke were experts at dark objects they wouldve recognized a horcrux straightaway 
 
 ron yawned pointedly repressing a strong urge to throw something at him harry plowed on i still reckon he might have hidden something at hogwarts 
 
 hermione sighed 
 
 but dumbledore would have found it harry 
 
 harry repeated the argument he kept bringing out in favor of this theory 
 
 dumbledore said in front of me that he never assumed he knew all of hogwarts secrets im telling you if there was one place vol c 
 
 oi 
 
 then harry shouted goaded past endurance if there was one place that was really important to it was hogwarts 
 
 oh come on scoffed ron his school 
 
 yeah his school it was his first real home the place that meant he was special it meant everything to him and even after he left c 
 
 this is were talking about right not you inquired ron he was tugging at the chain of the horcrux around his neck harry was visited by a desire to seize it and throttle him 
 
 you told us that asked dumbledore to give him a job after he left said hermione 
 
 thats right said harry 
 
 and dumbledore thought he only wanted to come back to try and find something probably another founders object to make into another horcrux 
 
 yeah said harry 
 
 but he didnt get the job did he said hermione so he never got the chance to find a founders object there and hide it in the school 
 
 okay then said harry defeated forget hogwarts 
 
 
 
 
 without any other leads they traveled into london and hidden beneath the invisibility cloak searching for the orphanage in which voldemort had been raised hermione stole into a library and discovered from their records that the place had been demolished many years before they visited its site and found a tower block of offices 
 
 we could try digging in to foundations hermione suggested halfheartedly 
 
 he wouldnt have hidden a horcrux here harry said he had known it all along the orphanage had been the place voldemort had been determined to escape he would never have hidden a part of his soul there dumbledore had shown harry that voldemort sought grandeur or mystique in his hiding places this dismal gray corner of london was as far removed as you could imagine from hogwarts of the ministry or a building like gringotts the wizarding banks with its gilded doors and marble floors 
 
 even without any new idea they continued to move through the countryside pitching the tent in a different place each night for security every morning they made sure that they had removed all clues to their presence then set off to find another lonely and secluded spot traveling by apparition to more woods to the shadowy crevices of cliffs to purple moors mountainsides and once a sheltered and pebbly cove every twelve hours or so they passed the horcrux between them as though they were playing some perverse game of where they dreaded the music stopping because the reward was twelve hours of increased fear and anxiety 
 
 harrys scar kept prickling it happened most often he noticed when he was wearing the horcrux sometimes he could not stop himself reacting to the pain 
 
 what what did you see demanded ron whenever he noticed harry wince 
 
 a face muttered harry every time the same face the thief who stole from gregorovitch 
 
 and ron would turn away making no effort to hide his disappointment harry knew that ron was hoping to bear news of his family or the rest of the order of the phoenix but after all he harry was not a television aerial he could only see what voldemort was thinking at the time not tune in to whatever took his fancy apparently voldemort was dwelling endlessly on the unknown youth with the gleeful face whose name and whereabouts harry felt sure voldemort knew no better than he did as harrys scar continued to burn and the merry boy swam tantalizingly in his memory he learned to suppress any sign of pain or discomfort for the other two showed nothing but impatience at the mention of the thief he could not entirely blame them when they were so desperate for a lead on the horcruxes 
 
 as the days stretched into weeks harry began to suspect that ron and hermione were having conversations without and about him several times they stopped talking abruptly when harry entered the tent and twice he came accidentally upon them huddled a little distance away heads together and talking fast both times they fell silent when they realized he was approaching them and hastened to appear busy collecting wood or water 
 
 harry could not help wondering whether they had only agreed to come on what now felt like a pointless and rambling journey because they thought he had some secret plan that they would learn in due course ron was making no effort to hide his bad mood and harry was starting to fear that hermione too was disappointed by his poor leadership in desperation he tried to think of further horcrux locations but the only one that continued to occur to him was hogwarts and as neither of the others thought this at all likely he stopped suggesting it 
 
 autumn rolled over the countryside as they moved through it they were now pitching the tent on mulches of fallen leaves natural mists joined those cast by the dementors wind and rain added to their troubles the fact that hermione was getting better at identifying edible fungi could not altogether compensate for their continuing isolation the lack of other peoples company or their total ignorance of what was going on in the war against voldemort 
 
 my mother said ron on night as they sat in the tent on a riverbank in wales can make good food appear out of thin air 
 
 he prodded moodily at the lumps of charred gray fish on his plate harry glanced automatically at rons neck and saw as he has expected the golden chain of the horcrux glinting there he managed to fight down the impulse to swear at ron whose attitude would he knew improve slightly when the time came to take off the locket 
 
 your mother cant produce food out of thin air said hermione no one can food is the first of the five principal exceptions to gamps law of elemental transfigura c 
 
 oh speak english cant you ron said prying a fish out from between his teeth 
 
 its impossible to make good food out of nothing you can summon it if you know where it is you can transform it you can increase the quantity if youve already got some c 
 
 well dont bother increasing this its disgusting said ron 
 
 harry caught the fish and i did my best with it i notice im always the one who ends up sorting out the food because im a girl i suppose 
 
 no its because youre supposed to be the best at magic shot back ron 
 
 hermione jumped up and bits of roast pike slid off her tin plate onto the floor 
 
 you can do the cooking tomorrow ron you can find the ingredients and try and charm them into something worth eating and ill sit here and pull faces and moan and you can see you c 
 
 shut up said harry leaping to his feet and holding up both hands shut up now 
 
 hermione looked outraged 
 
 how can you side with him he hardly ever does the cook c 
 
 hermione be quiet i can hear someone 
 
 he was listening hard his hands still raised warning them not to talk then over the rush and gush of the dark river beside them he heard voices again he looked around at the sneakoscope it was not moving 
 
 you cast the muffliato charm over us right he whispered to hermione 
 
 i did everything she whispered back muffliato and disillusionment charms all of it they shouldnt be able to hear of see us whoever they are 
 
 heavy scuffing and scraping noises plus the sound of dislodged stones and twigs told them that several people were clambering down the steep wooded slope that descended to the narrow bank where they had pitched the tent they drew their wands waiting the enchantments they had cast around themselves ought to be sufficient in the near total darkness to shield them from the notice of muggles and normal witches and wizards if these were death eaters then perhaps their defenses were about to be tested by dark magic for the first time 
 
 the voices became louder but no more intelligible as the group of men reached the bank harry estimated that their owners were fewer than twenty feet away but the cascading river made it impossible to tell for sure hermione snatched up the beaded bag and started to rummage after a moment she drew out three extendible ears and threw one each to harry and ron who hastily inserted the ends of the strings into their ears and fed the other ends out of the tent entrance 
 
 within seconds harry heard a weary male voice 
 
 there ought to be a few salmon in here or dyou reckon its too early in the season accio salmon 
 
 there were several distinct splashes and then the slapping sounds of fish against flesh somebody grunted appreciatively harry pressed the extendable ear deeper into his own over the murmur of the river he could make out more voices but they were not speaking english or any human language he had ever heard it was a rough and unmelodious tongue a string of rattling guttural noises and there seemed to be two speakers one with a slightly lower slower voice than the other 
 
 a fire danced into life on the other side of the canvas large shadows passed between tent and flames the delicious smell of baking salmon wafted tantalizingly in their direction then came the clinking of cutlery on plates and the first man spoke again 
 
 here griphook gornuk 
 
 goblins hermione mouthed at harry who nodded 
 
 thank you said the goblins together in english 
 
 so you three have been on the run how long asked a new mellow and pleasant voice it was vaguely familiar to harry who pictured a man 
 
 six weeks seven i forget said the tired man met up with griphook in the first couple of days and joined forces with gornuk not long after nice to have a but of company there was a pause while knives scraped plates and tin mugs were picked up and replaced on the ground what made you leave ted continued the man 
 
 knew they were coming for me replied ted and harry suddenly knew who he was tonkss father heard death eaters were in the area last week and decided id better run for it refused to register as a on principle see so i knew it was a matter of time knew id have to leave in the end my wife should be okay shes and then i met dean here what a few days ago son 
 
 yeah said another voice and harry ron and hermione stared at each other silent but besides themselves with excitement sure they recognized the voice of dean thomas their fellow gryffindor 
 
 eh asked the first man 
 
 not sure said dean my dad left my mum when i was a kid ive got no proof he was a wizard though 
 
 there was silence for a while except for the sounds of munching then ted spoke again 
 
 ive got to say dirk im surprised to run into you pleased but surprised word was that youd been caught 
 
 i was said dirk i was halfway to azkaban when i made a break for it stunned dawlish and nicked his broom it was easier than youd think i dont reckon hes quite right at the moment might be confunded if so id like to shake the hand of the witch or wizard who did it probably saved my life 
 
 there was another pause in which the fire crackled and the river rushed on the ted said and where do you two fit in i er had the impression the goblins were for on the whole 
 
 you had a false impression said the of the goblins we take no sides this is a wizards war 
 
 how come youre in hiding then 
 
 i deemed in prudent said the goblin having refused what i considered an impertinent request i could see that my person safety was in jeopardy 
 
 what did they ask you to do asked ted 
 
 duties the dignity of my race replied the goblin his voice rougher and less human as he said it i am not a 
 
 what about you griphook 
 
 similar reasons said the higher voiced goblin gringotts is no longer under the sole control of my race i recognize no wizarding master 
 
 he added something under his breath in gobbledegook and gornuk laughed 
 
 whats the joke asked dean 
 
 he said replied dirk that there are things wizards dont recognize either 
 
 there was a short pause 
 
 i dont get it said dean 
 
 i had my small revenge before i left said griphook in english 
 
 good man c goblin i should say amended ted hastily didnt manage to lock a death eater up in one of the old vaults i suppose 
 
 if i had the sword would not have helped him break out replied griphook gornuk laughed again and even dirk gave a dry chuckle 
 
 dean and i are still missing something here said ted 
 
 so is severus snape though he does not know it said griphook and the two goblins roared with malicious laughter inside the tent harrys breathing was shallow with excitement he and hermione stared at each other listening as hard as they could 
 
 didnt you hear about that ted asked dirk about the kids who tried to steal gryffindors sword out of snapes office at hogwarts 
 
 an electric current seemed to course through harry jangling his every nerve as he stood rooted to the spot 
 
 never heard a word said ted not in the prophet was it 
 
 hardly chortled dirk griphook here told me he heard about it from bill weasley who works for the bank one of the kids who tried to take the sword was bills younger sister 
 
 harry glanced toward hermione and ron both of whom were clutching the extendable ears as tightly as lifelines 
 
 she and a couple of friends got into snapes office and smashed open the glass case where he was apparently keeping the sword snape caught them as they were trying to smuggle it down the staircase 
 
 ah god bless em said ted what did they think that theyd be able to use the sword on or on snape himself 
 
 well whatever they thought they were going to do with it snape decided the sword wasnt safe where it was said dirk couple of days later once hed got the from i imagine he sent it down to london to be kept in gringotts instead 
 
 the goblins started to laugh again 
 
 im still not seeing the joke said ted 
 
 its a fake rasped griphook 
 
 the sword of gryffindor 
 
 oh yes it is a copy c an excellent copy it is true c but it was the original was forged centuries ago by goblins and had certain properties only armor possesses wherever the genuine sword of gryffindor is it is not in a vault at gringotts bank 
 
 i see said ted and i take it you didnt bother telling the death eaters this 
 
 i saw no reason to trouble them with the information said griphook smugly and now ted and dean joined in gornuk and dirks laughter 
 
 inside the tent harry closed his eyes willing someone to ask the question he needed answered and after a minute that seemed ten dean obliged he was harry remembered with a jolt an of ginnys too 
 
 what happened to ginny and all the others the ones who tried to steal it 
 
 oh they were punished and cruelly said griphook indifferently 
 
 theyre okay though asked ted quickly i mean the weasleys dont need any more of their kids injured do they 
 
 they suffered no serious injury as far as i am aware said griphook 
 
 lucky for them said ted with snapes track record i suppose we should just be glad theyre still alive 
 
 you believe that story then do you ted asked dirk you believe snape killed dumbledore 
 
 course i do said ted youre not going to sit there and tell me you think potter had anything to do with it 
 
 hard to know what to believe these days muttered dirk 
 
 i know harry potter said dean and i reckon hes the real thing c the chosen one or whatever you want to call it 
 
 yeah theres a lot would like to believe hes that son said dirk me included but where is he run for it by the looks of things youd think if he knew anything we dont or had anything special going for him hed be out there now fighting rallying resistance instead of hiding and you know the prophet made a pretty good case against him c 
 
 the prophet scoffed ted you deserve to be lied to if youre still reading that much dirk you want the facts try the quibbler 
 
 there was a sudden explosion of choking and retching plus a good deal of thumping by the sound of it dirk had swallowed a fish bone at last he sputtered the quibbler that lunatic rag of xeno lovegoods 
 
 its not so lunatic these days said ted you want to give it a look xeno is printing all the stuff the prophets ignoring not a single mention of snorkacks in the last issue how long theyll let him get with it mind i dont know but xeno says front page of every issue that any wizard whos against ought to make helping harry potter their priority 
 
 hard to help a boy whos vanished off the face of the earth said dirk 
 
 listen the fact that they havent caught him yets one hell of an achievement said ted id take tips from him gladly its what were trying to do stay free isnt it 
 
 yeah well youve got a point there said dirk heavily with the whole of the ministry and all their informers looking for him id have expected him to be caught by now mind whos to say they havent already caught and killed him without publicizing it 
 
 ah dont say that dirk murmured ted 
 
 there was a long pause filled with more clattering of knives and forks when they spoke again it was to discuss whether they ought to sleep on the back or retreat back up the wooded slope deciding the trees would give better cover they extinguished their fire then clambered back up the incline their voices fading away 
 
 harry ron and hermione reeled in the extendable ears harry who had found the need to remain silent increasingly difficult the longer they eavesdropped now found himself unable to say more then ginny c the sword c 
 
 i know said hermione 
 
 she lunged for the tiny beaded bag this time sinking her arm in it right up to the armpit 
 
 here we are she said between gritted teeth and she pulled at something that was evidently in the depths of the bag slowly the edge of an ornate picture frame came into sight harry hurried to help her as they lifted the empty portrait of phineas nigellus free of hermiones bag she kept her wand pointing at it ready to cast a spell at any moment 
 
 if somebody swapped the real sword for the face while it was in dumbledores office she panted as they propped the painting against the side of the tent phineas nigellus would have seen it happen he hangs right beside the case 
 
 unless he was asleep said harry but he still held his breath as hermione knelt down in front of the empty canvas her wand directed at its center cleared her throat then said 
 
 er c phineas phineas nigellus 
 
 nothing happened 
 
 phineas nigellus said hermione again professor black please could we talk to you please 
 
 please always helps said a cold snide voice and phineas nigellus slid into his portrait at one hermione cried 
 
 obscura 
 
 a black blindfold appeared over phineas nigelluss clever dark eyes causing him to bump into the frame and shriek with pain 
 
 what c how dare c what are you c 
 
 im very sorry professor black said hermione but its a necessary precaution 
 
 remove this foul addition at once remove it i say you are ruining a great work of art where am i what is going on 
 
 never mind where we are said harry and phineas nigellus froze abandoning his attempts to peel off the painted blindfold 
 
 can that possible be the voice of the elusive mr potter 
 
 maybe said harry knowing that this would keep phineas nigelluss interest weve got a couple of questions to ask you c about the sword of gryffindor 
 
 ah said phineas nigellus now turning his head this way and that in an effort to catch sight of harry yes that silly girl acted most unwisely there c 
 
 shut up about my sister said ron roughly phineas nigellus raised supercilious eyebrows 
 
 who else is here he asked turning his head from side to side your tone displeases me the girl and her friends were foolhardily in the extreme thieving from the headmaster 
 
 they werent thieving said harry that sword isnt snapes 
 
 it belongs to professor snapes school said phineas nigellus exactly what claim did the weasley girl have upon it she deserved her punishment as did the idiot longbottom and the lovegood oddity 
 
 neville is not an idiot and luna is not an oddity said hermione 
 
 where am i repeated phineas nigellus starting to wrestle with the blindfold again where have you brought me why have you removed me from the house of my forebears 
 
 never mind that how did snape punish ginny neville and luna asked harry urgently 
 
 professor snape sent them into the forbidden forest to do some work for the oaf hagrid 
 
 hagrids not an oaf said hermione shrilly 
 
 and snape mightve though that was a punishment said harry but ginny neville and luna probably had a good laugh with hagrid the forbidden forest theyve faced plenty worse than the forbidden forest big deal 
 
 he felt relieved he had been imagining horrors the cruciatus curse at the very least 
 
 what we really wanted to know professor black is whether anyone else has um taken out the sword at all maybe its been taken away for cleaning c or something 
 
 phineas nigellus paused again in his struggles to free his eyes and sniggered 
 
 he said armor does not require cleaning simple girl goblins silver repels mundane dirt imbibing only that which strengthens it 
 
 dont call hermione simple said harry 
 
 i grow weary of contradiction said phineas nigellus perhaps it is time for me to return to the headmasters office 
 
 still blindfolded he began groping the side of his frame trying to feel his way out of his picture and back into the one at hogwarts harry had a sudden inspiration 
 
 dumbledore cant you bring us dumbledore 
 
 i beg your pardon asked phineas nigellus 
 
 professor dumbledores portrait c couldnt you bring him along here into yours 
 
 phineas nigellus turned his face in the direction of harrys voice 
 
 evidently it is not only who are ignorant potter the portraits of hogwarts may commune with each other but they cannot travel outside of the castle except to visit a painting of themselves elsewhere dumbledore cannot come here with me and after the treatment i have received at your hands i can assure you that i will not be making a return visit 
 
 slightly crestfallen harry watched phineas redouble his attempts to leave his frame 
 
 professor black said hermione couldnt you just tell us please when was the last time the sword was taken out of its case before ginny took it out i mean 
 
 phineas snorted impatiently 
 
 i believe that the last time i saw the sword of gryffindor leave its case was when professor dumbledore used it to break open a ring 
 
 hermione whipped around to look at harry neither of them dared say more in front of phineas nigellus who had at least managed to locate the exit 
 
 well good night to you he said a little waspishly and he began to move out of sight again only the edge of his hat brim remained in view when harry gave a sudden shout 
 
 wait have you told snape you saw this 
 
 phineas nigellus stuck his blindfolded head back into the picture 
 
 professor snape has more important things on his mind that the many eccentricities of albus dumbledore potter 
 
 and with that he vanished completely leaving behind him nothing but his murky backdrop 
 
 harry hermione cried 
 
 i know harry shouted unable to contain himself he punched the air it was more than he had dared to hope for he strode up and down the tent feeling that he could have run a mile he did not even feel hungry anymore hermione was squashing phineas nigelluss back into the beaded bag when she had fastened the clasp she threw the bag aside and raised a shining face to harry 
 
 the sword can destroy horcruxes blades imbibe only that which strengthens them c harry that swords impregnated with basilisk venom 
 
 and dumbledore didnt give it to me because he still needed it he wanted to use it on the locket c 
 
 c and he must have realized they wouldnt let you have it if he put it in his will c 
 
 c so he made a copy c 
 
 c and put a fake in the glass case c 
 
 c and he left the real one c where 
 
 they gazed at east other harry felt that the answer was dangling invisibly in the air above them tantalizingly close why hadnt dumbledore told him or had he in fact told harry but harry had not realized it at the time 
 
 think whispered hermione think where would he have left it 
 
 not at hogwarts said harry resuming his pacing 
 
 somewhere in hogsmeade suggested hermione 
 
 the shrieking shack said harry nobody ever goes in there 
 
 but snape knows how to get in wouldnt that be a bit risky 
 
 dumbledore trusted snape harry reminded her 
 
 not enough to tell him that he had swapped the swords said hermione 
 
 yeah youre right said harry and he felt even more cheered at the thought that dumbledore had had some reservations however faint about snapes trustworthiness so would he have hidden the sword well away from hogsmeade then what dyou reckon ron ron 
 
 harry looked around for one bewildered moment he thought that ron had left the tent then realized that ron was lying in the shadow of a bunk looking stony 
 
 oh remembered me have you he said 
 
 what 
 
 ron snorted as he stared up at the underside of the upper bunk 
 
 you two carry on dont let me spoil your fun 
 
 perplexed harry looked to hermione for help but she shook her head apparently as nonplussed as he was 
 
 whats the problem asked harry 
 
 problem theres no problem said ron still refusing to look at harry not according to you anyways 
 
 there were several plunks on the canvas over their heads it had started to rain 
 
 well youve obviously got a problem said harry spit it out will you 
 
 ron swung his long legs off the bed and sat up he looked mean unlike himself 
 
 all right ill spit it out dont expect me to skip up and down the tent because theres some other damn thing weve got to find just add it to the list of stuff you dont know 
 
 i dont know repeated harry i dont know 
 
 plunk plunk plunk the rain was falling harder and heavier it pattered on the bank all around them and into the river chattering through the dark dread doused harrys jubilation ron was saying exactly what he had suspected and feared him to be thinking 
 
 its not like im not having the time of my life here said ron you know with my arm mangled and nothing to eat and freezing my backside off every night i just hoped you know after wed been running round a few weeks wed have achieved something 
 
 ron hermione said but in such a quiet voice that ron could pretend not to have heard it over the loud tattoo the rain was beating on the tent 
 
 i thought you knew what youd signed up for said harry 
 
 yeah i thought i did too 
 
 so what part of it isnt living up to your expectations asked harry anger was coming to his defense now did you think wed be staying in hotels finding a horcrux every other day did you think youd be back to mummy by christmas 
 
 we thought you knew what you were doing shouted ron standing up and his words harry like scalding knives we thought dumbledore had told you what to do we thought you had a real plan 
 
 ron said hermione this time clearly audible over the rain thundering on the tent roof but again he ignored her 
 
 well sorry to let you down said harry his voice quite calm even though he felt hollow inadequate ive been straight with you from the start i told you everything dumbledore told me and in the case you havent noticed weve found one horcrux c 
 
 yeah and were about as near getting rid of it as we are to finding the rest of them c nowhere effing near in other words 
 
 take off the locket ron hermione said her voice unusually high please take it off you wouldnt be talking like this if you hadnt been wearing it all day 
 
 yeah he would said harry who did not want excuses made for ron dyou think i havent noticed the two of you whispering behind my back dyou think i didnt guess you were thinking this stuff 
 
 harry we werent c 
 
 dont lie ron hurled at her you said it too you said you were disappointed you said youd thought he had a bit more to go on than c 
 
 i didnt say it like that c harry i didnt she cried 
 
 the rain was pounding the tent tears were pouring down hermiones face and the excitement of a few minutes before had vanished as if it had never been a firework that had flared and died leaving everything dark wet and cold the sword of gryffindor was hidden they knew not where and their were three teenagers in a tent whose only achievement was not yet to be dead 
 
 so why are you still here harry asked ron 
 
 search me said ron 
 
 go home then said harry 
 
 yeah maybe i will shouted ron and he took several steps toward harry who did not back away didnt you hear what they said about my sister but you dont give a rats fart do you its only the forbidden forest harry potter doesnt care what happened to her in there c well i do all right giant spiders and mental stuff c 
 
 i was only saying c she was with the others they were with hagrid c 
 
 yeah i get it you dont care and what about the rest of my family the weasleys dont need another kid injured did you hear that 
 
 yeah i c 
 
 not bothered what it meant though 
 
 ron said hermione forcing her way between them i dont think it means anything new has happened anything we dont know about think ron bills already scared plenty of people must have seen that george has lost an ear by now and youre supposed to be on your deathbed with spattergroit im sure thats all he meant c 
 
 oh youre sure are you right then well i wont bother myself about them its all right for you isnt it with your parents safely out of the way c 
 
 my parents are dead harry bellowed 
 
 and mine could be going the same way yelled ron 
 
 then go roared harry go back to them pretend youre got over your spattergroit and mummyll be able to feed you up and c 
 
 ron made a sudden movement harry reacted but before either wand was clear of its owners pocket hermione had raised her own 
 
 prestego she cried and an invisible shield expanded between her and harry on the one side and ron on the other all of them were forced backward a few steps by the strength of the spell and harry and ron glared from either side of the transparent barrier as though they were seeing each other clearly for the first time harry felt a corrosive hatred toward ron something had broken between them 
 
 leave the horcrux harry said 
 
 ron wrenched the chain from over his head and cast the locket into a nearby chair he turned to hermione 
 
 what are you doing 
 
 what do you mean 
 
 are you staying or what 
 
 i she looked anguished yes c yes im staying ron we said wed go with harry we said wed help c 
 
 i get it you choose him 
 
 ron no c please c come back come back 
 
 she was impeded by her own shield charm by the time she had removed it he had already stormed into the night harry stood quite still and silent listening to her sobbing and calling rons name amongst the trees 
 
 after a few minutes she returned her sopping hair plastered to her face 
 
 hes disapparated 
 
 she threw herself into a chair curled up and started to cry 
 
 harry felt dazed he stooped picked up the horcrux and placed it around his own neck he dragged blankets off rons bunk and threw them over hermione then he climbed onto his own bed and stared up at the dark canvas roof listening to the pounding of the rain 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the deathly hallows 
 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 ib and little christina 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 in the forest that extends from the banks of the gudenau in north 
 jutland a long way into the country and not far from the clear 
 stream rises a great ridge of land which stretches through the 
 wood like a wall westward of this ridge and not far from the 
 river stands a farmhouse surrounded by such poor land that the sandy soil shows itself between the scanty ears of rye and wheat which grow in it some years have passed since the people who lived here cultivated these fields they kept three sheep a pig and two oxen in fact they maintained themselves very well they had quite enough to live upon as people generally have who are content with their lot they even could have afforded to keep two horses but it was a saying among the farmers in those parts the horse eats himself up that is to say he eats as much as he earns jeppe jans 
 cultivated his fields in summer and in the winter he made wooden 
 shoes he also had an assistant a lad who understood as well as he 
 himself did how to make wooden shoes strong but light and in the 
 fashion they carved shoes and spoons which paid well therefore no one could justly call jeppe jans and his family poor people little 
 ib a boy of seven years old and the only child would sit by 
 watching the workmen or cutting a stick and sometimes his finger 
 instead of the stick but one day ib succeeded so well in his 
 carving that he made two pieces of wood look really like two little 
 wooden shoes and he determined to give them as a present to little 
 christina 
 
 and who was little christina she was the daughter 
 graceful and delicate as the child of a gentleman had she been 
 dressed differently no one would have believed that she lived in a 
 hut on the neighboring heath with her father he was a widower and 
 earned his living by carrying firewood in his large boat from the 
 forest to the and on the estate of silkborg and 
 sometimes even to the distant town of randers there was no one 
 under whose care he could leave little christina so she was almost 
 always with him in his boat or playing in the wood among the 
 blossoming heath or picking the ripe wild berries sometimes when 
 her father had to go as far as the town he would take little 
 christina who was a year younger than ib across the heath to the 
 cottage of jeppe jans and leave her there ib and christina agreed 
 together in everything they divided their bread and berries when they 
 were hungry they were partners in digging their little gardens 
 they ran and crept and played about everywhere once they wandered a long way into the forest and even ventured together to climb the high ridge another time they found a few snipes eggs in the wood which was a great event ib had never been on the heath where father lived nor on the river but at last came an opportunity 
 
 father invited him to go for a sail in his boat and the 
 evening before he accompanied the boatman across the heath to his 
 house the next morning early the two children were placed on the top of a high pile of firewood in the boat and sat eating bread and 
 wild strawberries while father and his man drove the boat 
 forward with poles they floated on swiftly for the tide was in their 
 favor passing over lakes formed by the stream in its course 
 sometimes they seemed quite enclosed by reeds and yet 
 there was always room for them to pass out although the old trees 
 overhung the water and the old oaks stretched out their bare branches as if they had turned up their sleeves and wished to show their knotty naked arms old whose roots were loosened from the banks clung with their fibres to the bottom of the stream and the tops of the branches above the water looked like little woody 
 islands the waved themselves to and fro on the river 
 everything made the excursion beautiful and at last they came to 
 the great where the water rushed through the 
 and the children thought this a beautiful sight in those days there 
 was no factory nor any town house nothing but the great farm with 
 its fields in which could be seen a few herd of 
 cattle and one or two farm laborers the rushing of the water through 
 the sluices and the scream of the wild ducks were almost the only 
 signs of active life at silkborg after the firewood had been 
 unloaded father bought a whole bundle of eels and a 
 which were all placed in a basket in the stern of the 
 boat then they returned again up the stream and as the wind was 
 favorable two sails were hoisted which carried the boat on as well 
 as if two horses had been harnessed to it as they sailed on they 
 came by chance to the place where the assistant lived at 
 a little distance from the bank of the river the boat was moored and 
 the two men after desiring the children to sit still both went on 
 shore they obeyed this order for a very short time and then forgot 
 it altogether first they peeped into the basket containing the eels 
 and the then they must needs pull out the pig and take it 
 in their hands and feel it and touch it and as they both wanted 
 to hold it at the same time the consequence was that they let it fall 
 into the water and the pig sailed away with the stream 
 here was a terrible disaster ib jumped ashore and ran a little 
 distance from the boat 
 
 oh take me with you cried christina and she sprang after him 
 in a few minutes they found themselves deep in a thicket and could no longer see the boat or the shore they ran on a little farther and 
 then christina fell down and began to cry 
 
 ib helped her up and said never mind follow me yonder is 
 the house but the house was not yonder and they wandered still 
 farther over the dry rustling leaves of the last year and treading 
 on fallen branches that crackled under their little feet then they 
 heard a loud piercing cry and they stood still to listen 
 
 presently the scream of an eagle sounded through the wood it was an 
 ugly cry and it frightened the children but before them in the 
 thickest part of the forest grew the most beautiful blackberries 
 in wonderful quantities they looked so inviting that the children 
 could not help stopping and they remained there so long eating 
 that their mouths and cheeks became quite black with the juice 
 
 presently they heard the frightful scream again and christina 
 said we shall get into trouble about that pig 
 oh never mind said ib we will go home to my 
 house it is here in the wood so they went on but the road led them 
 out of the way no house could be seen it grew dark and the children 
 were afraid the solemn stillness that reigned around them was now and then broken by the shrill cries of the great horned owl and other 
 birds that they knew nothing of at last they both lost themselves 
 in the thicket christina began to cry and then ib cried too and 
 after weeping and lamenting for some time they stretched themselves 
 down on the dry leaves and fell asleep 
 
 the sun was high in the heavens when the two children woke they 
 felt cold but not far from their on a hill the sun 
 was shining through the trees they thought if they went there they 
 should be warm and ib fancied he should be able to see his 
 house from such a high spot but they were far away from home now in quite another part of the forest they clambered to the top of 
 the rising ground and found themselves on the edge of a declivity 
 which sloped down to a clear transparent lake great quantities of 
 fish could be seen through the clear water sparkling in the 
 rays they were quite surprised when they came so suddenly upon such an unexpected sight 
 
 close to where they stood grew a covered with 
 beautiful nuts they soon gathered some cracked them and ate the 
 fine young kernels which were only just ripe but there was another 
 surprise and fright in store for them out of the thicket stepped a 
 tall old woman her face quite brown and her hair of a deep shining 
 black the whites of her eyes glittered like a on her back she 
 carried a bundle and in her hand a knotted stick she was a gypsy 
 the children did not at first understand what she said she drew out 
 of her pocket three large nuts in which she told them were hidden the 
 most beautiful and lovely things in the world for they were wishing 
 nuts ib looked at her and as she spoke so kindly he took courage 
 and asked her if she would give him the nuts and the woman gave 
 them to him and then gathered some more from the bushes for 
 herself quite a pocket full ib and christina looked at the wishing 
 nuts with wide open eyes 
 
 is there in this nut a carriage with a pair of horses asked 
 ib 
 
 yes there is a golden carriage with two golden horses replied 
 the woman 
 
 then give me that nut said christina so ib gave it to her and 
 the strange woman tied up the nut for her in her handkerchief 
 ib held up another nut is there in this nut a pretty little 
 neckerchief like the one christina has on her neck asked ib 
 
 there are ten neckerchiefs in it she replied as well as 
 beautiful dresses stockings and a hat and veil 
 
 then i will have that one also said christina and it is a 
 pretty one too and then ib gave her the second nut 
 the third was a little black thing you may keep that one 
 said christina it is quite as pretty 
 
 what is in it asked ib 
 
 the best of all things for you replied the gypsy so ib held 
 the nut very tight 
 
 then the woman promised to lead the children to the right path 
 that they might find their way home and they went forward certainly 
 in quite another direction to the one they meant to take therefore no 
 one ought to speak against the woman and say that she wanted to steal the children in the wild they met a forester who knew ib and by his help ib and christina reached home where they found every one had been very anxious about them they were pardoned and forgiven although they really had both done wrong and deserved to get into trouble first because they had let the fall into the water and secondly because they had run away christina was taken back to her house on the heath and ib remained in the on the borders of the wood near the great land ridge 
 
 the first thing ib did that evening was to take out of his 
 pocket the little black nut in which the best thing of all was said 
 to be enclosed he laid it carefully between the door and the 
 and then shut the door so that the nut cracked directly 
 but there was not much kernel to be seen it was what we should call 
 hollow or and looked as if it had been filled with tobacco or rich black earth it is just what i expected exclaimed ib 
 how should there be room in a little nut like this for the best thing 
 of all christina will find her two nuts just the same there will 
 be neither fine clothes or a golden carriage in them 
 
 winter came and the new year and indeed many years passed 
 away until ib was old enough to be confirmed and therefore he went during a whole winter to the clergyman of the nearest village to be prepared 
 
 one day about this time the boatman paid a visit to 
 parents and told them that christina was going to service and that 
 she had been remarkably fortunate in obtaining a good place with most respectable people only think he said she is going to the rich at the hotel in herning many miles west from here 
 she is to assist the landlady in the housekeeping and if afterwards 
 she behaves well and remains to be confirmed the people will treat 
 her as their own daughter 
 
 so ib and christina took leave of each other people already 
 called them the betrothed and at parting the girl showed ib the two 
 nuts which she had taken care of ever since the time that they lost 
 themselves in the wood and she told him also that the little wooden 
 shoes he once carved for her when he was a boy and gave her as a 
 present had been carefully kept in a drawer ever since and so they 
 parted 
 
 after confirmation he remained at home with his mother 
 for he had become a clever shoemaker and in summer managed the farm for her quite alone his father had been dead some time and his 
 mother kept no farm servants sometimes but very seldom he heard 
 of christina through a postillion or who was passing 
 
 but she was well off with the rich innkeeper and after being 
 confirmed she wrote a letter to her father in which was a kind 
 message to ib and his mother in this letter she mentioned that her 
 master and mistress had made her a present of a beautiful new dress 
 and some nice this was of course pleasant news 
 
 one day in the following spring there came a knock at the door 
 of the house where old mother lived and when they opened it 
 lo and behold in stepped the boatman and christina she had come to pay them a visit and to spend the day a carriage had to come from the herning hotel to the next village and she had taken the 
 opportunity to see her friends once more she looked as elegant as a 
 real lady and wore a pretty dress beautifully made on purpose for 
 her there she stood in full dress while ib wore only his working 
 clothes he could not utter a word he could only seize her hand and 
 hold it fast in his own but he felt too happy and glad to open his 
 lips christina however was quite at her ease she talked and 
 talked and kissed him in the most friendly manner even afterwards 
 when they were left alone and she asked did you know me again ib he still stood holding her hand and said at last you are become quite a grand lady christina and i am only a rough working man but i have often thought of you and of old times then they 
 wandered up the great ridge and looked across the stream to the 
 heath where the little hills were covered with the flowering broom 
 ib said nothing but before the time came for them to part it 
 became quite clear to him that christina must be his wife had they 
 not even in childhood been called the betrothed to him it seemed as 
 if they were really engaged to each other although not a word had 
 been spoken on the subject they had only a few more hours to remain together for christina was obliged to return that evening to the 
 neighboring village to be ready for the carriage which was to start 
 the next morning early for herning ib and her father accompanied 
 her to the village it was a fine moonlight evening and when they 
 arrived ib stood holding hand in his as if he could 
 not let her go his eyes brightened and the words he uttered came 
 with hesitation from his lips but from the deepest recesses of his 
 heart christina if you have not become too grand and if you can be 
 contented to live in my house as my wife we will be 
 married some day but we can wait for a while 
 
 oh yes she replied let us wait a little longer ib i can 
 trust you for i believe that i do love you but let me think it 
 over then he kissed her lips and so they parted 
 
 on the way home ib told the boatman that he and christina were as 
 good as engaged to each other and the boatman found out that he had always expected it would be so and went home with ib that evening and remained the night in the farmhouse but nothing further was said of the engagement during the next year two letters passed 
 between ib and christina they were signed faithful till death but 
 at the end of that time one day the boatman came over to see ib with 
 a kind greeting from christina he had something else to say which 
 made him hesitate in a strange manner at last it came out that 
 christina who had grown a very pretty girl was more lucky than ever 
 
 she was courted and admired by every one but her son who had been home on a visit was so much pleased with christina that he wished to marry her he had a very good situation in an office at copenhagen and as she had also taken a liking for him his parents 
 were not unwilling to consent but christina in her heart often 
 thought of ib and knew how much he thought of her so she felt 
 inclined to refuse this good fortune added the boatman at first ib 
 said not a word but he became as white as the wall and shook his 
 head gently and then he spoke christina must not refuse this 
 good fortune 
 
 then will you write a few words to her said the boatman 
 ib sat down to write but he could not get on at all the words 
 were not what he wished to say so he tore up the page the 
 following morning however a letter lay ready to be sent to 
 christina and the following is what he wrote 
 
 the letter written by you to your father i have read and see 
 from it that you are prosperous in everything and that still better 
 fortune is in store for you ask your own heart christina and 
 think over carefully what awaits you if you take me for your 
 husband for i possess very little in the world do not think of me or 
 of my position think only of your own welfare you are bound to me by no promises and if in your heart you have given me one i release you from it may every blessing and happiness be poured out upon you christina heaven will give me the consolation 
 ever your sincere friend ib 
 this letter was sent and christina received it in due time in 
 the course of the following november her banns were published in 
 the church on the heath and also in copenhagen where the 
 bridegroom lived she was taken to copenhagen under the protection 
 of her future because the bridegroom could not spare 
 time from his numerous occupations for a journey so far into 
 jutland on the journey christina met her father at one of the 
 villages through which they passed and here he took leave of her 
 very little was said about the matter to ib and he did not refer to 
 it his mother however noticed that he had grown very silent and 
 pensive thinking as he did of old times no wonder the three nuts 
 came into his mind which the gypsy woman had given him when a child and of the two which he had given to christina these wishing nuts after all had proved true one had contained a gilded carriage and noble horses and the other beautiful clothes all of 
 these christina would now have in her new home at copenhagen her part had come true and for him the nut had contained only black earth the gypsy woman had said it was the best for him perhaps it was and this also would be fulfilled he understood the gypsy meaning now the black earth the dark grave was the best thing for him now 
 
 again years passed away not many but they seemed long years to 
 ib the old innkeeper and his wife died one after the other and the 
 whole of their property many thousand dollars was inherited by their 
 son christina could have the golden carriage now and plenty of 
 fine clothes during the two long years which followed no letter came 
 from christina to her father and when at last her father received one 
 from her it did not speak of prosperity or happiness poor christina 
 neither she nor her husband understood how to economize or save and the riches brought no blessing with them because they had not asked for it 
 
 years passed and for many summers the heath was covered with 
 bloom in winter the snow rested upon it and the rough winds blew 
 across the ridge under which stood sheltered home one spring day the sun shone brightly and he was guiding the plough across his 
 field the ploughshare struck against something which he fancied was a firestone and then he saw glittering in the earth a splinter of 
 shining metal which the plough had cut from something which gleamed brightly in the furrow he searched and found a large golden armlet of superior workmanship and it was evident that the plough had disturbed a grave he searched further and found more 
 valuable treasures which ib showed to the clergyman who explained 
 their value to him then he went to the magistrate who informed the 
 president of the museum of the discovery and advised ib to take the 
 treasures himself to the president 
 
 you have found in the earth the best thing you could find 
 said the magistrate 
 
 the best thing thought ib the very best thing for me and 
 found in the earth well if it really is so then the gypsy woman was 
 right in her prophecy 
 
 so ib went in the from aarhus to copenhagen to him who had only sailed once or twice on the river near his own home this seemed like a voyage on the ocean and at length he arrived at 
 copenhagen the value of the gold he had found was paid to him it was a large sum six hundred dollars then ib of the heath went out and wandered about in the great city 
 
 on the evening before the day he had settled to return with the 
 captain of the ib lost himself in the streets and 
 took quite a different turning to the one he wished to follow he 
 wandered on till he found himself in a poor street of the suburb 
 called haven not a creature could be seen at last a very 
 little girl came out of one of the houses and ib 
 asked her to tell him the way to the street he wanted she looked up 
 timidly at him and began to cry bitterly he asked her what was the 
 matter but what she said he could not understand so he went along 
 the street with her and as they passed under a lamp the light fell 
 on the little face a strange sensation came over ib as he 
 caught sight of it the living breathing embodiment of little 
 christina stood before him just as he remembered her in the days of 
 her childhood he followed the child to the wretched house and 
 ascended the narrow crazy staircase which led to a little garret in 
 the roof the air in the room was heavy and stifling no light was 
 burning and from one corner came sounds of moaning and sighing it was the mother of the child who lay there on a miserable bed with the help of a match ib struck a light and approached her 
 
 can i be of any service to you he asked this little girl 
 brought me up here but i am a stranger in this city are there no 
 neighbors or any one whom i can call 
 
 then he raised the head of the sick woman and smoothed her 
 pillow he started as he did so it was christina of the heath no one 
 had mentioned her name to ib for years it would have disturbed his 
 peace of mind especially as the reports respecting her were not good 
 
 the wealth which her husband had inherited from his parents had made him proud and arrogant he had given up his certain appointment and travelled for six months in foreign lands and on his return had lived in great style and got into terrible debt for a time he had trembled on the high pedestal on which he had placed himself till 
 at last he toppled over and ruin came his numerous merry companions and the visitors at his table said it served him right for he had kept house like a madman one morning his corpse was found in the canal the cold hand of death had already touched the heart of 
 christina her youngest child looked for in the midst of 
 prosperity had sunk into the grave when only a few weeks old and 
 at last christina herself became sick unto death and lay forsaken 
 and dying in a miserable room amid poverty she might have borne in 
 her younger days but which was now more painful to her from the 
 luxuries to which she had lately been accustomed it was her eldest 
 child also a little christina whom ib had followed to her home 
 where she suffered hunger and poverty with her mother 
 
 it makes me unhappy to think that i shall die and leave this poor 
 child sighed she oh what will become of her she could say no 
 more 
 
 then ib brought out another match and lighted a piece of candle 
 which he found in the room and it threw a glimmering light over the 
 wretched dwelling ib looked at the little girl and thought of 
 christina in her young days for her sake could he not love this 
 child who was a stranger to him as he thus reflected the dying 
 woman opened her eyes and gazed at him did she recognize him he never knew for not another word escaped her lips 
 
 in the forest by the river gudenau not far from the heath and 
 beneath the ridge of land stood the little farm newly painted and 
 whitewashed the air was heavy and dark there were no blossoms on the heath the autumn winds whirled the yellow leaves towards the 
 hut in which strangers dwelt but the little farm stood 
 safely sheltered beneath the tall trees and the high ridge the turf 
 blazed brightly on the hearth and within was sunlight the 
 sparkling light from the sunny eyes of a child the birdlike tones 
 from the rosy lips ringing like the song of a lark in spring all 
 was life and joy little christina sat on knee ib was to her 
 both father and mother her own parents had vanished from her 
 memory as a vanishes alike from childhood and age 
 house was well and prettily furnished for he was a prosperous man now while the mother of the little girl rested in the churchyard at 
 copenhagen where she had died in poverty ib had money now money which had come to him out of the black earth and he had christina for his own after all

 angle from behind poster 
 as norton rips the poster from before our eyes stunned faces peer in camera pulls slowly reveal the long crumbling tunnel in the wall 
 int cell minutes later 
 rory tremont a guard barely out of his teens tries not to look nervous as they lash a rope around his chest getting instructions from six different people at once 
 red 
 they got this skinny kid named rory tremont to go in the hole he much in the brains department but he possessed the one most important qualification for the job 
 they slap a flashlight in his hands 
 he was willing to go 
 int tunnel day 
 rory squeezes down the tunnel on his belly 
 red 
 probably thought win a bronze star or something 
 int vertical shaft day 
 dark as midnight concrete walls rise on both sides if you imagine them as two huge slices of bread the meat of this particular sandwich is about three feet of airspace and a dark tangle of pipes between the cellblocks appears shining his flashlight down the shaft somewhere a rat squeaks 
 red 
 it was his third day on the job 
 rory 
 warden a space here between the walls bout three feet across smells pretty damn bad 
 norton 
 i care what it smells like 
 hadley 
 go on boy we got a hold of you 
 looking none too happy about it rory squeezes from the tunnel and dangles into the shaft he gets lowered shining his light smothered by darkness not having a good time 
 rory 
 gettin worse 
 norton 
 never mind i said just keep going 
 rory 
 smells pretty damn bad warden in fact it smells just like shit 
 his feet touch the ground or what he assumed was the ground not in fact just what it smells like he sinks in past his ankles he slips and sits heavily in it 
 rory 
 oh god what it is shit oh my god shit pull me out fore i blow my groceries oh shit shit oh my gawwwwwwd 
 int cell day 
 red and others listen to violent barfing from below 
 red 
 and then came the unmistakable sound of rory tremont losing his 
 last few meals the whole cellblock heard it i mean it echoed 
 it for red he starts laughing laughing hell bellowing laughter laughing so hard he has to hold himself laughing so hard tears are pouring down his cheeks the look of rage on face makes him laugh all the harder 
 int solitary wing night 
 abrupt silence low angle on steel door 
 red 
 i laughed myself right into solitary two week stretch

 andy once talked about doing easy time in the hole now i knew what he meant

 red 
 in andy dufresne escaped from shawshank prison 
 ext field day 
 shawshank is half a mile distant we track along a muddy creel as state troopers and prison guards scour the brush a troopee fishes a prison uniform out of the creek with a long stick 
 red 
 all they found of him was a muddy set of prison clothes a bar of 
 soap and an old damn near worn down to the nub 
 trooper g pulls the from the weeds swish pan 
 to a police photographer his flashbulb glare produces 
 a black and white still photo 
 of the hapless cops posing with reeking uniform and the 
 worn push in on the hammer 
 red 
 i remember thinking it would take a man six hundred years to tunnel 
 through the wall with it andy did it in less than twenty 
 int cell night 
 once again we see andy using the to scratch his name into the cement suddenly a chunk of cement pops free and hits the floor he stares down at it 
 int cell night 
 andy lies in the dark studying the chunk of concrete in his hands considering the possibilities wrestling with hope 
 red 
 andy loved geology i imagine it appealed to his meticulous nature 
 an ice age here a million years of there plates of 
 bedrock grinding against each other over a span of millennia 
 int cell night 
 andy stands peering at the small hole left by the fallen chunk carefully runs his fingertip over it 
 red 
 geology is the study of pressure and time all it takes really pressure and time 
 int cell night 
 rita is now on the wall hanging down over back 
 red 
 that and a big damn poster 
 track in to reveal andy scraping patiently at the concrete 
 red 
 like i said in prison a do most anything to keep his mind 
 occupied 
 he hears footsteps approaching he smoothes the poster down and dives into bed a guard strolls by a moment later shining his 
 flashlight into the cell

 chapter xv 
 
 on returning late in the evening sonya went to room and to her surprise found her still dressed and asleep on the sofa open on the table beside her lay letter sonya picked it up and read it 
 as she read she glanced at the sleeping natasha trying to find in her face an explanation of what she was reading but did not find it her face was calm gentle and happy clutching her breast to keep herself from choking sonya pale and trembling with fear and agitation sat down in an armchair and burst into tears 
 how was it i noticed nothing how could it go so far can she have left off loving prince andrew and how could she let kuragin go to such lengths he is a deceiver and a villain plain what will nicholas dear noble nicholas do when he hears of it so this is the meaning of her excited resolute unnatural look the day before yesterday yesterday and today thought sonya but it be that she loves him she probably opened the letter without knowing who it was from probably she is offended by it she could not do such a thing 
 sonya wiped away her tears and went up to natasha again scanning her face 
 natasha she said just audibly 
 natasha awoke and saw sonya 
 ah back 
 and with the decision and tenderness that often come at the moment of awakening she embraced her friend but noticing look of embarrassment her own face expressed confusion and suspicion 
 sonya read that letter she demanded 
 yes answered sonya softly 
 natasha smiled rapturously 
 no sonya i any longer she said i hide it from you any longer you know we love one another sonya darling he writes sonya 
 sonya stared at natasha unable to believe her ears 
 and bolkonski she asked 
 ah sonya if you only knew how happy i am cried natasha you know what love is 
 but natasha can that be all over 
 natasha looked at sonya with eyes as if she could not grasp the question 
 well then are you refusing prince andrew said sonya 
 oh you understand anything talk nonsense just listen said natasha with momentary vexation 
 but i believe it insisted sonya i understand how is it you have loved a man for a whole year and suddenly why you have only seen him three times natasha i believe you joking in three days to forget everything and so 
 three days said natasha it seems to me loved him a hundred years it seems to me that i have never loved anyone before you understand it sonya wait a bit sit here and natasha embraced and kissed her 
 i had heard that it happens like this and you must have heard it too but only now that i feel such love not the same as before as soon as i saw him i felt he was my master and i his slave and that i could not help loving him yes his slave whatever he orders i shall do you understand that what can i do what can i do sonya cried natasha with a happy yet frightened expression 
 but think what you are doing cried sonya i leave it like this this secret correspondence how could you let him go so far she went on with a horror and disgust she could hardly conceal 
 i told you that i have no will natasha replied why you understand i love him 
 then i let it come to that i shall tell cried sonya bursting into tears 
 what do you mean for sake if you tell you are my enemy declared natasha you want me to be miserable you want us to be separated 
 when she saw fright sonya shed tears of shame and pity for her friend 
 but what has happened between you she asked what has he said to you why he come to the house 
 natasha did not answer her questions 
 for sake sonya tell anyone torture me natasha entreated remember no one ought to interfere in such matters i have confided in you 
 but why this secrecy why he come to the house asked sonya why he openly ask for your hand you know prince andrew gave you complete freedom if it is really so but i believe it natasha have you considered what these secret reasons can be 
 natasha looked at sonya with astonishment evidently this question presented itself to her mind for the first time and she did not know how to answer it 
 i know what the reasons are but there must be reasons 
 sonya sighed and shook her head incredulously 
 if there were reasons she began 
 but natasha guessing her doubts interrupted her in alarm 
 sonya one doubt him one one you understand she cried 
 does he love you 
 does he love me natasha repeated with a smile of pity at her lack of comprehension why you have read his letter and you have seen him 
 but if he is dishonorable 
 he dishonorable if you only knew exclaimed natasha 
 if he is an honorable man he should either declare his intentions or cease seeing you and if you do this i will i will write to him and i will tell papa said sonya resolutely 
 but i live without him cried natasha 
 natasha i understand you and what are you saying think of your father and of nicholas 
 i want anyone i love anyone but him how dare you say he is dishonorable you know that i love him screamed natasha go away sonya i want to quarrel with you but go for sake go you see how i am suffering natasha cried angrily in a voice of despair and repressed irritation sonya burst into sobs and ran from the room 
 natasha went to the table and without a reflection wrote that answer to princess mary which she had been unable to write all the morning in this letter she said briefly that all their misunderstandings were at an end that availing herself of the magnanimity of prince andrew who when he went abroad had given her her she begged princess mary to forget everything and forgive her if she had been to blame toward her but that she could not be his wife at that moment this all seemed quite easy simple and clear to natasha 
 on friday the rostovs were to return to the country but on wednesday the count went with the prospective purchaser to his estate near moscow 
 on the day the count left sonya and natasha were invited to a big dinner party at the karagins and marya dmitrievna took them there at that party natasha again met anatole and sonya noticed that she spoke to him trying not to be overheard and that all through dinner she was more agitated than ever when they got home natasha was the first to begin the explanation sonya expected 
 there sonya you were talking all sorts of nonsense about him natasha began in a mild voice such as children use when they wish to be praised we have had an explanation today 
 well what happened what did he say natasha how glad i am not angry with me tell me everything the whole truth what did he say 
 natasha became thoughtful 
 oh sonya if you knew him as i do he said he asked me what i had promised bolkonski he was glad i was free to refuse him 
 sonya sighed sorrowfully 
 but you refused bolkonski said she 
 perhaps i have perhaps all is over between me and bolkonski why do you think so badly of me 
 i think anything only i understand this 
 wait a bit sonya understand everything see what a man he is now think badly of me or of him i think badly of anyone i love and pity everybody but what am i to do 
 sonya did not succumb to the tender tone natasha used toward her the more emotional and ingratiating the expression of face became the more serious and stern grew 
 natasha said she you asked me not to speak to you and i spoken but now you yourself have begun i trust him natasha why this secrecy 
 again again interrupted natasha 
 natasha i am afraid for you 
 afraid of what 
 i am afraid going to your ruin said sonya resolutely and was herself horrified at what she had said 
 anger again showed in face 
 and go to my ruin i will as soon as possible not your business it be you but i suffer leave me alone leave me alone i hate you 
 natasha moaned sonya aghast 
 i hate you i hate you my enemy forever and natasha ran out of the room 
 natasha did not speak to sonya again and avoided her with the same expression of agitated surprise and guilt she went about the house taking up now one occupation now another and at once abandoning them 
 hard as it was for sonya she watched her friend and did not let her out of her sight 
 the day before the count was to return sonya noticed that natasha sat by the drawingroom window all the morning as if expecting something and that she made a sign to an officer who drove past whom sonya took to be anatole 
 sonya began watching her friend still more attentively and noticed that at dinner and all that evening natasha was in a strange and unnatural state she answered questions at random began sentences she did not finish and laughed at everything 
 after tea sonya noticed a housemaid at door timidly waiting to let her pass she let the girl go in and then listening at the door learned that another letter had been delivered 
 then suddenly it became clear to sonya that natasha had some dreadful plan for that evening sonya knocked at her door natasha did not let her in 
 she will run away with him thought sonya she is capable of anything there was something particularly pathetic and resolute in her face today she cried as she said to uncle sonya remembered yes it she means to elope with him but what am i to do thought she recalling all the signs that clearly indicated that natasha had some terrible intention the count is away what am i to do write to kuragin demanding an explanation but what is there to oblige him to reply write to pierre as prince andrew asked me to in case of some misfortune but perhaps she really has already refused bolkonski she sent a letter to princess mary yesterday and uncle is away to tell marya dmitrievna who had such faith in natasha seemed to sonya terrible well anyway thought sonya as she stood in the dark passage now or never i must prove that i remember the goodness to me and that i love nicholas yes if i sleep for three nights not leave this passage and will hold her back by force and will and not let the family be disgraced thought she

 chapter xiii 
 
 little gavroche 
 eight or nine years after the events narrated in the second part of this story people noticed on the boulevard du temple and in the regions of the a little boy eleven or twelve years of age who would have realized with tolerable accuracy that ideal of the gamin sketched out above if with the laugh of his age on his lips he had not had a heart absolutely sombre and empty this child was well muffled up in a pair of trousers but he did not get them from his father and a chemise but he did not get it from his mother 
 some people or other had clothed him in rags out of charity 
 still he had a father and a mother but his father did not think of him and his mother did not love him 
 he was one of those children most deserving of pity among all one of those who have father and mother and who are orphans nevertheless 
 this child never felt so well as when he was in the street the pavements were less hard to him than his heart 
 his parents had despatched him into life with a kick 
 he simply took flight 
 he was a boisterous pallid nimble jeering lad with a vivacious but sickly air 
 he went and came sang played at hopscotch scraped the gutters stole a little but like cats and sparrows gayly laughed when he was called a rogue and got angry when called a thief 
 he had no shelter no bread no fire no love but he was merry because he was free 
 when these poor creatures grow to be men the millstones of the social order meet them and crush them but so long as they are children they escape because of their smallness 
 the tiniest hole saves them 
 nevertheless abandoned as this child was it sometimes happened every two or three months that he said come go and see mamma then he quitted the boulevard the cirque the porte descended to the quays crossed the bridges reached the suburbs arrived at the salpetriere and came to a halt where 
 precisely at that double number with which the reader is acquainted at the gorbeau hovel 
 at that epoch the hovel generally deserted and eternally decorated with the placard 
 chambers to let chanced to be a rare thing inhabited by numerous individuals who however as is always the case in paris had no connection with each other all belonged to that indigent class which begins to separate from the lowest of petty bourgeoisie in straitened circumstances and which extends from misery to misery into the lowest depths of society down to those two beings in whom all the material things of civilization end the who sweeps up the mud and the ragpicker who collects scraps 
 the principal lodger of jean day was dead and had been replaced by another exactly like her 
 i know not what philosopher has said 
 old women are never lacking 
 this new old woman was named madame bourgon and had nothing remarkable about her life except a dynasty of three paroquets who had reigned in succession over her soul 
 the most miserable of those who inhabited the hovel were a family of four persons consisting of father mother and two daughters already well grown all four of whom were lodged in the same attic one of the cells which we have already mentioned 
 at first sight this family presented no very special feature except its extreme destitution the father when he hired the chamber had stated that his name was jondrette 
 some time after his moving in which had borne a singular resemblance to the entrance of nothing at all to borrow the memorable expression of the principal tenant this jondrette had said to the woman who like her predecessor was at the same time portress and mother if any one should chance to come and inquire for a pole or an italian or even a spaniard perchance it is i 
 this family was that of the merry barefoot boy 
 he arrived there and found distress and what is still sadder no smile a cold hearth and cold hearts 
 when he entered he was asked whence come you 
 he replied 
 from the street 
 when he went away they asked him 
 whither are you going 
 he replied into the streets 
 his mother said to him 
 what did you come here for 
 this child lived in this absence of affection like the pale plants which spring up in cellars 
 it did not cause him suffering and he blamed no one 
 he did not know exactly how a father and mother should be 
 nevertheless his mother loved his sisters 
 we have forgotten to mention that on the boulevard du temple this child was called little gavroche 
 why was he called little gavroche 
 probably because his name was jondrette 
 it seems to be the instinct of certain wretched families to break the thread 
 the chamber which the jondrettes inhabited in the gorbeau hovel was the last at the end of the corridor 
 the cell next to it was occupied by a very poor young man who was called m marius 
 let us explain who this m marius was

 chapter xvi 
 
 anatole had lately moved to the plan for natalie abduction had been arranged and the preparations made by dolokhov a few days before and on the day that sonya after listening at door resolved to safeguard her it was to have been put into execution natasha had promised to come out to kuragin at the back porch at ten that evening kuragin was to put her into a troyka he would have ready and to drive her forty miles to the village of kamenka where an unfrocked priest was in readiness to perform a marriage ceremony over them at kamenka a relay of horses was to wait which would take them to the warsaw highroad and from there they would hasten abroad with post horses 
 anatole had a passport an order for post horses ten thousand rubles he had taken from his sister and another ten thousand borrowed with help 
 two witnesses for the mock marriage khvostikov a retired petty official whom dolokhov made use of in his gambling transactions and makarin a retired hussar a kindly weak fellow who had an unbounded affection for kuragin were sitting at tea in front room 
 in his large study the walls of which were hung to the ceiling with persian rugs bearskins and weapons sat dolokhov in a traveling cloak and high boots at an open desk on which lay abacus and some bundles of paper money anatole with uniform unbuttoned walked to and fro from the room where the witnesses were sitting through the study to the room behind where his french valet and others were packing the last of his things dolokhov was counting the money and noting something down 
 well he said khvostikov must have two thousand 
 give it to him then said anatole 
 makarka their name for makarin will go through fire and water for you for nothing so here are our accounts all settled said dolokhov showing him the memorandum is that right 
 yes of course returned anatole evidently not listening to dolokhov and looking straight before him with a smile that did not leave his face 
 dolokhov banged down the or of his and turned to anatole with an ironic smile 
 do you know really better drop it all still time 
 fool retorted anatole talk nonsense if you only knew the devil knows what 
 no really give it up said dolokhov i am speaking seriously no joke this plot hatched 
 what teasing again go to the devil eh said anatole making a grimace really no time for your stupid jokes and he left the room 
 dolokhov smiled contemptuously and condescendingly when anatole had gone out 
 you wait a bit he called after him not joking talking sense come here come here 
 anatole returned and looked at dolokhov trying to give him his attention and evidently submitting to him involuntarily 
 now listen to me telling you this for the last time why should i joke about it did i hinder you who arranged everything for you who found the priest and got the passport who raised the money i did it all 
 well thank you for it do you think i am not grateful and anatole sighed and embraced dolokhov 
 i helped you but all the same i must tell you the truth it is a dangerous business and if you think about it a stupid business well carry her off all right will they let it stop at that it will come out that already married why have you in the criminal court 
 oh nonsense nonsense anatole ejaculated and again made a grimace i explain to you what and anatole with the partiality people have for any conclusion they have reached by their own reasoning repeated the argument he had already put to dolokhov a hundred times i explain to you that i have come to this conclusion if this marriage is invalid he went on crooking one finger then i have nothing to answer for but if it is valid no matter abroad no one will know anything about it that so and talk to me 
 seriously better drop it only get yourself into a mess 
 go to the devil cried anatole and clutching his hair left the room but returned at once and dropped into an armchair in front of dolokhov with his feet turned under him the very devil what feel how it beats he took hand and put it on his heart what a foot my dear fellow what a glance a goddess he added in french what 
 dolokhov with a cold smile and a gleam in his handsome insolent eyes looked at him evidently wishing to get some more amusement out of him 
 well and when the gone what then 
 what then eh repeated anatole sincerely perplexed by a thought of the future what then then i know but why talk nonsense he glanced at his watch time 
 anatole went into the back room 
 now then nearly ready dawdling he shouted to the servants 
 dolokhov put away the money called a footman whom he ordered to bring something for them to eat and drink before the journey and went into the room where khvostikov and makarin were sitting 
 anatole lay on the sofa in the study leaning on his elbow and smiling pensively while his handsome lips muttered tenderly to himself 
 come and eat something have a drink dolokhov shouted to him from the other room 
 i want to answered anatole continuing to smile 
 come balaga is here 
 anatole rose and went into the dining room balaga was a famous troyka driver who had known dolokhov and anatole some six years and had given them good service with his troykas more than once when regiment was stationed at tver he had taken him from tver in the evening brought him to moscow by daybreak and driven him back again the next night more than once he had enabled dolokhov to escape when pursued more than once he had driven them through the town with gypsies and ladykins as he called the cocottes more than once in their service he had run over pedestrians and upset vehicles in the streets of moscow and had always been protected from the consequences by my gentlemen as he called them he had ruined more than one horse in their service more than once they had beaten him and more than once they had made him drunk on champagne and madeira which he loved and he knew more than one thing about each of them which would long ago have sent an ordinary man to siberia they often called balaga into their orgies and made him drink and dance at the gypsies and more than one thousand rubles of their money had passed through his hands in their service he risked his skin and his life twenty times a year and in their service had lost more horses than the money he had from them would buy but he liked them liked that mad driving at twelve miles an hour liked upsetting a driver or running down a pedestrian and flying at full gallop through the moscow streets he liked to hear those wild tipsy shouts behind him get on get on when it was impossible to go any faster he liked giving a painful lash on the neck to some peasant who more dead than alive was already hurrying out of his way real gentlemen he considered them 
 anatole and dolokhov liked balaga too for his masterly driving and because he liked the things they liked with others balaga bargained charging rubles for a two hours drive and rarely drove himself generally letting his young men do so but with his gentlemen he always drove himself and never demanded anything for his work only a couple of times a year when he knew from their valets that they had money in hand he would turn up of a morning quite sober and with a deep bow would ask them to help him the gentlemen always made him sit down 
 do help me out theodore ivanych sir or your excellency he would say i am quite out of horses let me have what you can to go to the fair 
 and anatole and dolokhov when they had money would give him a thousand or a couple of thousand rubles 
 balaga was a short and peasant of about with a particularly red thick neck glittering little eyes and a small beard he wore a fine cloth coat over a sheepskin 
 on entering the room now he crossed himself turning toward the front corner of the room and went up to dolokhov holding out a small black hand 
 theodore ivanych he said bowing 
 how do friend well here he is 
 good day your excellency he said again holding out his hand to anatole who had just come in 
 i say balaga said anatole putting his hands on the shoulders do you care for me or not eh now do me a service what horses have you come with eh 
 as your messenger ordered your special beasts replied balaga 
 well listen balaga drive all three to death but get me there in three hours eh 
 when they are dead what shall i drive said balaga with a wink 
 mind smash your face in make jokes cried anatole suddenly rolling his eyes 
 why joke said the driver laughing as if grudge my gentlemen anything as fast as ever the horses can gallop so fast go 
 ah said anatole well sit down 
 yes sit down said dolokhov 
 stand theodore ivanych 
 sit down nonsense have a drink said anatole and filled a large glass of madeira for him 
 the eyes sparkled at the sight of the wine after refusing it for manners sake he drank it and wiped his mouth with a red silk handkerchief he took out of his cap 
 and when are we to start your excellency 
 well anatole looked at his watch start at once mind balaga get there in time eh 
 that depends on our luck in starting else why we be there in time replied balaga we get you to tver in seven hours i think you remember that your excellency 
 do you know one christmas i drove from tver said anatole smilingly at the recollection and turning to makarin who gazed rapturously at him with eyes will you believe it makarka it took breath away the rate we flew we came across a train of loaded sleighs and drove right over two of them eh 
 those were horses balaga continued the tale that time harnessed two young side horses with the bay in the shafts he went on turning to dolokhov will you believe it theodore ivanych those animals flew forty miles i hold them in my hands grew numb in the sharp frost so that i threw down the reins catch hold yourself your excellency says i and i just tumbled on the bottom of the sleigh and sprawled there it a case of urging them on there was no holding them in till we reached the place the devils took us there in three hours only the near one died of it

 ninety years and teeth 
 in the rue boucherat rue de normandie and the rue de saintonge there still exist a few ancient inhabitants who have preserved the memory of a worthy man named m gillenormand and who mention him with complaisance 
 this good man was old when they were young this silhouette has not yet entirely those who regard with melancholy that vague swarm of shadows which is called the past from the labyrinth of streets in the vicinity of the temple to which under louis xiv the names of all the provinces of france were appended exactly as in our day the streets of the new tivoli quarter have received the names of all the capitals of europe a progression by the way in which progress is visible 
 who was as much alive as possible in was one of those men who had become curiosities to be viewed simply because they have lived a long time and who are strange because they formerly resembled everybody and now resemble nobody he was a peculiar old man and in very truth a man of another age the real complete and rather haughty bourgeois of the eighteenth century who wore his good old bourgeoisie with the air with which marquises wear their marquisates 
 he was over ninety years of age his walk was erect he talked loudly saw clearly drank neat ate slept and snored 
 he had all of his teeth he only wore spectacles when he read 
 he was of an amorous disposition but declared that for the last ten years he had wholly and decidedly renounced women 
 he could no longer please he said he did not add 
 i am too old but 
 i am too poor 
 he said if i were not 
 all he had left in fact was an income of about fifteen thousand francs 
 his dream was to come into an inheritance and to have a hundred thousand livres income for mistresses 
 he did not belong as the reader will perceive to that puny variety of octogenaries who like m de voltaire have been dying all their life his was no longevity of a cracked pot this jovial old man had always had good health 
 he was superficial rapid easily angered 
 he flew into a passion at everything generally quite contrary to all reason 
 when contradicted he raised his cane he beat people as he had done in the great century he had a daughter over fifty years of age and unmarried whom he chastised severely with his tongue when in a rage and whom he would have liked to whip 
 she seemed to him to be eight years old he boxed his servants ears soundly and said 
 ah carogne one of his oaths was 
 by the pantoufloche of the pantouflochade he had singular freaks of tranquillity he had himself shaved every day by a barber who had been mad and who detested him being jealous of m gillenormand on account of his wife a pretty and coquettish barberess 
 m gillenormand admired his own discernment in all things and declared that he was extremely sagacious here is one of his sayings 
 i have in truth some penetration i am able to say when a flea bites me from what woman it came 
 the words which he uttered the most frequently were 
 the sensible man and nature 
 he did not give to this last word the grand acceptation which our epoch has accorded to it but he made it enter after his own fashion into his little satires nature he said in order that civilization may have a little of everything gives it even specimens of its amusing barbarism europe possesses specimens of asia and africa on a small scale the cat is a tiger the lizard is a pocket crocodile the dancers at the opera are pink female savages 
 they do not eat men they crunch them or magicians that they are they transform them into oysters and swallow them 
 the caribbeans leave only the bones they leave only the shell 
 such are our morals 
 we do not devour we gnaw we do not exterminate we claw

 anatole went out of the room and returned a few minutes later wearing a fur coat girt with a silver belt and a sable cap jauntily set on one side and very becoming to his handsome face having looked in a mirror and standing before dolokhov in the same pose he had assumed before it he lifted a glass of wine 
 well theodore thank you for everything and farewell said anatole well comrades and friends he considered for a moment of my youth farewell he said turning to makarin and the others 
 though they were all going with him anatole evidently wished to make something touching and solemn out of this address to his comrades he spoke slowly in a loud voice and throwing out his chest slightly swayed one leg 
 all take glasses you too balaga well comrades and friends of my youth had our fling and lived and reveled eh and now when shall we meet again i am going abroad we have had a good time now farewell lads to our health hurrah he cried and emptying his glass flung it on the floor 
 to your health said balaga who also emptied his glass and wiped his mouth with his handkerchief 
 makarin embraced anatole with tears in his eyes 
 ah prince how sorry i am to part from you 
 go go cried anatole 
 balaga was about to leave the room 
 no stop said anatole shut the door we have first to sit down the way 
 they shut the door and all sat down 
 now quick march lads said anatole rising 
 joseph his valet handed him his sabretache and saber and they all went out into the vestibule 
 and the fur cloak asked dolokhov hey ignatka go to matrena matrevna and ask her for the sable cloak i have heard what elopements are like continued dolokhov with a wink why rush out more dead than alive just in the things she is wearing if you delay at all be tears and papa and mamma and frozen in a minute and must go back but you wrap the fur cloak round her first thing and carry her to the sleigh 
 the valet brought a cloak 
 fool i told you the sable one hey matrena the sable he shouted so that his voice rang far through the rooms 
 a handsome slim and gypsy girl with glittering black eyes and curly hair wearing a red shawl ran out with a sable mantle on her arm 
 here i grudge it take it she said evidently afraid of her master and yet regretful of her cloak 
 dolokhov without answering took the cloak threw it over matrena and wrapped her up in it 
 the way said dolokhov and then so and he turned the collar up round her head leaving only a little of the face uncovered and then so do you see and he pushed head forward to meet the gap left by the collar through which brilliant smile was seen 
 well matrena said anatole kissing her ah my revels here are over remember me to steshka there matrena wish me luck 
 well prince may god give you great luck said matrena in her gypsy accent 
 two troykas were standing before the porch and two young drivers were holding the horses balaga took his seat in the front one and holding his elbows high arranged the reins deliberately anatole and dolokhov got in with him makarin khvostikov and a valet seated themselves in the other sleigh 
 well are you ready asked balaga 
 go he cried twisting the reins round his hands and the troyka tore down the nikitski boulevard 
 tproo get out of the way hi tproo the shouting of balaga and of the sturdy young fellow seated on the box was all that could be heard on the arbat square the troyka caught against a carriage something cracked shouts were heard and the troyka flew along the arbat street 
 after taking a turn along the podnovinski boulevard balaga began to rein in and turning back drew up at the crossing of the old konyusheny street 
 the young fellow on the box jumped down to hold the horses and anatole and dolokhov went along the pavement when they reached the gate dolokhov whistled the whistle was answered and a maidservant ran out 
 come into the courtyard or be seen come out directly said she 
 dolokhov stayed by the gate anatole followed the maid into the courtyard turned the corner and ran up into the porch 
 he was met by gabriel marya gigantic footman 
 come to the mistress please said the footman in his deep bass intercepting any retreat 
 to what mistress who are you asked anatole in a breathless whisper 
 kindly step in my orders are to bring you in 
 kuragin come back shouted dolokhov betrayed back 
 dolokhov after anatole entered had remained at the wicket gate and was struggling with the yard porter who was trying to lock it with a last desperate effort dolokhov pushed the porter aside and when anatole ran back seized him by the arm pulled him through the wicket and ran back with him to the troyka

 like master like house 
 he lived in the marais rue des no he owned the house 
 this house has since been demolished and rebuilt and the number has probably been changed in those revolutions of numeration which the streets of paris undergo 
 he occupied an ancient and vast apartment on the first floor between street and gardens furnished to the very ceilings with great gobelins and beauvais tapestries representing pastoral scenes the subjects of the ceilings and the panels were repeated in miniature on the he enveloped his bed in a vast screen of coromandel lacquer 
 long full curtains hung from the windows and formed great broken folds that were very magnificent the garden situated immediately under his windows was attached to that one of them which formed the angle by means of a staircase twelve or fifteen steps long which the old gentleman ascended and descended with great agility 
 in addition to a library adjoining his chamber he had a boudoir of which he thought a great deal a gallant and elegant retreat with magnificent hangings of straw with a pattern of flowers and made on the galleys of louis xiv 
 and ordered of his convicts by m de vivonne for his mistress 
 m gillenormand had inherited it from a grim maternal who had died a centenarian 
 he had had two wives his manners were something between those of the courtier which he had never been and the lawyer which he might have been he was gay and caressing when he had a mind 
 in his youth he had been one of those men who are always deceived by their wives and never by their mistresses because they are at the same time the most sullen of husbands and the most charming of lovers in existence 
 he was a connoisseur of painting 
 he had in his chamber a marvellous portrait of no one knows whom painted by jordaens executed with great dashes of the brush with millions of details in a confused and manner 
 m attire was not the habit of louis xiv 
 nor yet that of louis xvi it was that of the incroyables of the directory 
 he had thought himself young up to that period and had followed the fashions his coat was of cloth with voluminous revers a long and large steel buttons 
 with this he wore and buckle shoes 
 he always thrust his hands into his fobs he said authoritatively 
 the french revolution is a heap of blackguards

 marya dmitrievna having found sonya weeping in the corridor made her confess everything and intercepting the note to natasha she read it and went into room with it in her hand 
 you shameless said she i hear a word 
 pushing back natasha who looked at her with astonished but tearless eyes she locked her in and having given orders to the yard porter to admit the persons who would be coming that evening but not to let them out again and having told the footman to bring them up to her she seated herself in the drawing room to await the abductors 
 when gabriel came to inform her that the men who had come had run away again she rose frowning and clasping her hands behind her paced through the rooms a long time considering what she should do toward midnight she went to room fingering the key in her pocket sonya was sitting sobbing in the corridor marya dmitrievna for sake let me in to her she pleaded but marya dmitrievna unlocked the door and went in without giving her an answer disgusting abominable in my house horrid girl hussy only sorry for her father thought she trying to restrain her wrath hard as it may be tell them all to hold their tongues and will hide it from the count she entered the room with resolute steps natasha lying on the sofa her head hidden in her hands and she did not stir she was in just the same position in which marya dmitrievna had left her 
 a nice girl very nice said marya dmitrievna arranging meetings with lovers in my house no use pretending you listen when i speak to you and marya dmitrievna touched her arm listen when when i speak disgraced yourself like the lowest of hussies treat you differently but sorry for your father so i will conceal it 
 natasha did not change her position but her whole body heaved with noiseless convulsive sobs which choked her marya dmitrievna glanced round at sonya and seated herself on the sofa beside natasha 
 lucky for him that he escaped me but find him she said in her rough voice do you hear what i am saying or not she added 
 she put her large hand under face and turned it toward her both marya dmitrievna and sonya were amazed when they saw how natasha looked her eyes were dry and glistening her lips compressed her cheeks sunken 
 let me be what is it to me i shall die she muttered wrenching herself from marya hands with a vicious effort and sinking down again into her former position 
 natalie said marya dmitrievna i wish for your good lie still stay like that then i touch you but listen i tell you how guilty you are you know that yourself but when your father comes back tomorrow what am i to tell him eh 
 again body shook with sobs 
 suppose he finds out and your brother and your betrothed 
 i have no betrothed i have refused him cried natasha 
 all the same continued dmitrievna if they hear of this will they let it pass he your father i know him if he challenges him to a duel will that be all right eh 
 oh let me be why have you interfered at all why why who asked you to shouted natasha raising herself on the sofa and looking malignantly at marya dmitrievna 
 but what did you want cried marya dmitrievna growing angry again were you kept under lock and key who hindered his coming to the house why carry you off as if you were some gypsy singing girl well if he had carried you off do you think they have found him your father or brother or your betrothed and a scoundrel a wretch a fact 
 he is better than any of you exclaimed natasha getting up if you interfered oh my god what is it all what is it sonya why go away 
 and she burst into sobs with the despairing vehemence with which people bewail disasters they feel they have themselves occasioned marya dmitrievna was to speak again but natasha cried out 
 go away go away you all hate and despise me and she threw herself back on the sofa 
 marya dmitrievna went on admonishing her for some time enjoining on her that it must all be kept from her father and assuring her that nobody would know anything about it if only natasha herself would undertake to forget it all and not let anyone see that something had happened natasha did not reply nor did she sob any longer but she grew cold and had a shivering fit marya dmitrievna put a pillow under her head covered her with two quilts and herself brought her some water but natasha did not respond to her 
 well let her sleep said marya dmitrievna as she went of the room supposing natasha to be asleep 
 but natasha was not asleep with pale face and fixed eyes she looked straight before her all that night she did not sleep or weep and did not speak to sonya who got up and went to her several times 
 next day count rostov returned from his estate near moscow in time for lunch as he had promised he was in very good spirits the affair with the purchaser was going on satisfactorily and there was nothing to keep him any longer in moscow away from the countess whom he missed marya dmitrievna met him and told him that natasha had been very unwell the day before and that they had sent for the doctor but that she was better now natasha had not left her room that morning with compressed and parched lips and dry fixed eyes she sat at the window uneasily watching the people who drove past and hurriedly glancing round at anyone who entered the room she was evidently expecting news of him and that he would come or would write to her 
 when the count came to see her she turned anxiously round at the sound of a footstep and then her face resumed its cold and malevolent expression she did not even get up to greet him what is the matter with you my angel are you ill asked the count 
 after a silence natasha answered yes ill 
 in reply to the anxious inquiries as to why she was so dejected and whether anything had happened to her betrothed she assured him that nothing had happened and asked him not to worry marya dmitrievna confirmed assurances that nothing had happened from the pretense of illness from his distress and by the embarrassed faces of sonya and marya dmitrievna the count saw clearly that something had gone wrong during his absence but it was so terrible for him to think that anything disgraceful had happened to his beloved daughter and he so prized his own cheerful tranquillity that he avoided inquiries and tried to assure himself that nothing particularly had happened and he was only dissatisfied that her indisposition delayed their return to the country

 at the age of sixteen one evening at the opera he had had the honor to be stared at through by two beauties at the same and celebrated beauties then and sung by voltaire the camargo and the salle 
 caught between two fires he had beaten a heroic retreat towards a little dancer a young girl named nahenry who was sixteen like himself obscure as a cat and with whom he was in love 
 he abounded in memories 
 he was accustomed to exclaim how pretty she the last time i saw her at longchamps her hair curled in sustained sentiments with her of turquoises her gown of the color of persons newly arrived and her little agitation muff he had worn in his young manhood a waistcoat of which he was fond of talking about effusively 
 i was dressed like a turk of the levant levantin said he 
 madame de boufflers having seen him by chance when he was twenty had described him as a charming fool 
 he was horrified by all the names which he saw in politics and in power regarding them as vulgar and bourgeois he read the journals the newspapers the gazettes as he said stifling outbursts of laughter the while 
 oh he said what people these are 
 corbiere 
 humann 
 casimir perier a minister for you 
 i can imagine this in a journal m gillenorman minister that would be a farce 
 well 
 they are so stupid that it would pass he merrily called everything by its name whether decent or indecent and did not restrain himself in the least before ladies 
 he uttered coarse speeches obscenities and filth with a certain tranquillity and lack of astonishment which was elegant it was in keeping with the unceremoniousness of his century it is to be noted that the age of periphrase in verse was the age of crudities in prose 
 his had predicted that he would turn out a man of genius and had bestowed on him these two significant names

 from the day his wife arrived in moscow pierre had been intending to go away somewhere so as not to be near her soon after the rostovs came to moscow the effect natasha had on him made him hasten to carry out his intention he went to tver to see joseph widow who had long since promised to hand over to him some papers of her deceased 
 when he returned to moscow pierre was handed a letter from marya dmitrievna asking him to come and see her on a matter of great importance relating to andrew bolkonski and his betrothed pierre had been avoiding natasha because it seemed to him that his feeling for her was stronger than a married should be for his fiancee yet some fate constantly threw them together 
 what can have happened and what can they want with me thought he as he dressed to go to marya if only prince andrew would hurry up and come and marry her thought he on his way to the house 
 on the tverskoy boulevard a familiar voice called to him 
 pierre been back long someone shouted pierre raised his head in a sleigh drawn by two gray that were bespattering the dashboard with snow anatole and his constant companion makarin dashed past anatole was sitting upright in the classic pose of military dandies the lower part of his face hidden by his beaver collar and his head slightly bent his face was fresh and rosy his hat tilted to one side disclosed his curled and pomaded hair besprinkled with powdery snow 
 yes indeed a true sage thought pierre he sees nothing beyond the pleasure of the moment nothing troubles him and so he is always cheerful satisfied and serene what i give to be like him he thought enviously 
 in marya anteroom the footman who helped him off with his fur coat said that the mistress asked him to come to her bedroom 
 when he opened the ballroom door pierre saw natasha sitting at the window with a thin pale and spiteful face she glanced round at him frowned and left the room with an expression of cold dignity 
 what has happened asked pierre entering marya room 
 fine doings answered dmitrievna for years have i lived in this world and never known anything so disgraceful 
 and having put him on his honor not to repeat anything she told him marya dmitrievna informed him that natasha had refused prince andrew without her parents knowledge and that the cause of this was anatole kuragin into whose society wife had thrown her and with whom natasha had tried to elope during her absence in order to be married secretly 
 pierre raised his shoulders and listened to what was told him scarcely able to believe his own ears that prince deeply loved affianced wife the same natasha rostova who used to be so charming should give up bolkonski for that fool anatole who was already secretly married as pierre knew and should be so in love with him as to agree to run away with him was something pierre could not conceive and could not imagine 
 he could not reconcile the charming impression he had of natasha whom he had known from a child with this new conception of her baseness folly and cruelty he thought of his wife they are all alike he said to himself reflecting that he was not the only man unfortunate enough to be tied to a bad woman but still he pitied prince andrew to the point of tears and sympathized with his wounded pride and the more he pitied his friend the more did he think with contempt and even with disgust of that natasha who had just passed him in the ballroom with such a look of cold dignity he did not know that soul was overflowing with despair shame and humiliation and that it was not her fault that her face happened to assume an expression of calm dignity and severity 
 but how get married said pierre in answer to marya dmitrievna he could not marry he is married 
 things get worse from hour to hour ejaculated marya dmitrievna a nice youth what a scoundrel and expecting him expecting him since yesterday she must be told then at least she go on expecting him 
 after hearing the details of marriage from pierre and giving vent to her anger against anatole in words of abuse marya dmitrievna told pierre why she had sent for him she was afraid that the count or bolkonski who might arrive at any moment if they knew of this affair which she hoped to hide from them might challenge anatole to a duel and she therefore asked pierre to tell his in her name to leave moscow and not dare to let her set eyes on him again pierre only now realizing the danger to the old count nicholas and prince andrew promised to do as she wished having briefly and exactly explained her wishes to him she let him go to the drawing room 
 mind the count knows nothing behave as if you know nothing either she said and i will go and tell her it is no use expecting him and stay to dinner if you care to she called after pierre 
 pierre met the old count who seemed nervous and upset that morning natasha had told him that she had rejected bolkonski 
 troubles troubles my dear fellow he said to pierre what troubles one has with these girls without their mother i do so regret having come here i will be frank with you have you heard she has broken off her engagement without consulting anybody true this engagement never was much to my liking of course he is an excellent man but still with his disapproval they have been happy and natasha lack suitors still it has been going on so long and to take such a step without or consent and now ill and god knows what hard count hard to manage daughters in their absence 
 pierre saw that the count was much upset and tried to change the subject but the count returned to his troubles 
 sonya entered the room with an agitated face 
 natasha is not quite well in her room and would like to see you marya dmitrievna is with her and she too asks you to come 
 yes you are a great friend of no doubt she wants to send him a message said the count oh dear oh dear how happy it all was 
 and clutching the spare gray locks on his temples the count left the room 
 when marya dmitrievna told natasha that anatole was married natasha did not wish to believe it and insisted on having it confirmed by pierre himself sonya told pierre this as she led him along the corridor to room 
 natasha pale and stern was sitting beside marya dmitrievna and her eyes glittering feverishly met pierre with a questioning look the moment he entered she did not smile or nod but only gazed fixedly at him and her look asked only one thing was he a friend or 
 like the others an enemy in regard to anatole as for pierre he evidently did not exist for her 
 he knows all about it said marya dmitrievna pointing to pierre and addressing natasha let him tell you whether i have told the truth 
 natasha looked from one to the other as a hunted and wounded animal looks at the approaching dogs and sportsmen 
 natalya ilynichna pierre began dropping his eyes with a feeling of pity for her and loathing for the thing he had to do whether it is true or not should make no difference to you because 
 then it is not true that married 
 yes it is true 
 has he been married long she asked on your honor 
 pierre gave his word of honor 
 is he still here she asked quickly 
 yes i have just seen him 
 she was evidently unable to speak and made a sign with her hands that they should leave her alone

 neither the convention nor the death of louis xvi nor the napoleon nor the return of the bourbons nor anything else had been able to efface the memory of this crowning the duc de nevers was in his eyes the great figure of the century what a charming grand seigneur he said and what a fine air he had with his blue ribbon

 pierre did not stay for dinner but left the room and went away at once he drove through the town seeking anatole kuragin at the thought of whom now the blood rushed to his heart and he felt a difficulty in breathing he was not at the ice hills nor at the gypsies nor at pierre drove to the club in the club all was going on as usual the members who were assembling for dinner were sitting about in groups they greeted pierre and spoke of the town news the footman having greeted him knowing his habits and his acquaintances told him there was a place left for him in the small dining room and that prince michael zakharych was in the library but paul timofeevich had not yet arrived one of acquaintances while they were talking about the weather asked if he had heard of abduction of rostova which was talked of in the town and was it true pierre laughed and said it was nonsense for he had just come from the rostovs he asked everyone about anatole one man told him he had not come yet and another that he was coming to dinner pierre felt it strange to see this calm indifferent crowd of people unaware of what was going on in his soul he paced through the ballroom waited till everyone had come and as anatole had not turned up did not stay for dinner but drove home 
 anatole for whom pierre was looking dined that day with dolokhov consulting him as to how to remedy this unfortunate affair it seemed to him essential to see natasha in the evening he drove to his to discuss with her how to arrange a meeting when pierre returned home after vainly hunting all over moscow his valet informed him that prince anatole was with the countess the countess drawing room was full of guests 
 pierre without greeting his wife whom he had not seen since his return at that moment she was more repulsive to him than ever entered the drawing room and seeing anatole went up to him 
 ah pierre said the countess going up to her husband you know what a plight our anatole 
 she stopped seeing in the forward thrust of her head in his glowing eyes and his resolute gait the terrible indications of that rage and strength which she knew and had herself experienced after his duel with dolokhov 
 where you are there is vice and evil said pierre to his wife anatole come with me i must speak to you he added in french 
 anatole glanced round at his sister and rose submissively ready to follow pierre pierre taking him by the arm pulled him toward himself and was leading him from the room 
 if you allow yourself in my drawing room whispered helene but pierre did not reply and went out of the room 
 anatole followed him with his usual jaunty step but his face betrayed anxiety 
 having entered his study pierre closed the door and addressed anatole without looking at him 
 you promised countess rostova to marry her and were about to elope with her is that so 
 mon cher answered anatole their whole conversation was in french i consider myself bound to answer questions put to me in that tone 
 face already pale became distorted by fury he seized anatole by the collar of his uniform with his big hand and shook him from side to side till face showed a sufficient degree of terror 
 when i tell you that i must talk to you repeated pierre 
 come now this is stupid what said anatole fingering a button of his collar that had been wrenched loose with a bit of the cloth 
 a scoundrel and a blackguard and i know what deprives me from the pleasure of smashing your head with this said pierre expressing himself so artificially because he was talking french 
 he took a heavy paperweight and lifted it threateningly but at once put it back in its place 
 did you promise to marry her 
 i i think of it i never promised because 
 pierre interrupted him 
 have you any letters of hers any letters he said moving toward anatole 
 anatole glanced at him and immediately thrust his hand into his pocket and drew out his pocketbook 
 pierre took the letter anatole handed him and pushing aside a table that stood in his way threw himself on the sofa 
 i be violent be afraid said pierre in answer to a frightened gesture of first the letters said he as if repeating a lesson to himself secondly he continued after a short pause again rising and again pacing the room tomorrow you must get out of moscow 
 but how can i 
 thirdly pierre continued without listening to him you must never breathe a word of what has passed between you and countess rostova i know i prevent your doing so but if you have a spark of conscience pierre paced the room several times in silence 
 anatole sat at a table frowning and biting his lips 
 after all you must understand that besides your pleasure there is such a thing as other happiness and peace and that you are ruining a whole life for the sake of amusing yourself amuse yourself with women like my wife with them you are within your rights for they know what you want of them they are armed against you by the same experience of debauchery but to promise a maid to marry her to deceive to kidnap you understand that it is as mean as beating an old man or a child 
 pierre paused and looked at anatole no longer with an angry but with a questioning look 
 i know about that eh said anatole growing more confident as pierre mastered his wrath i know that and want to he said not looking at pierre and with a slight tremor of his lower jaw but you have used such words to me mean and so on which as a man of honor i allow anyone to use 
 pierre glanced at him with amazement unable to understand what he wanted 
 though it was anatole continued still i 
 is it satisfaction you want said pierre ironically 
 you could at least take back your words what if you want me to do as you wish eh 
 i take them back i take them back said pierre and i ask you to forgive me pierre involuntarily glanced at the loose button and if you require money for your journey 
 anatole smiled the expression of that base and cringing smile which pierre knew so well in his wife revolted him 
 oh vile and heartless brood he exclaimed and left the room 
 next day anatole left for petersburg

 basque and nicolette 
 he had theories 
 here is one of them 
 when a man is passionately fond of women and when he has himself a wife for whom he cares but little who is homely cross legitimate with plenty of rights perched on the code and jealous at need there is but one way of extricating himself from the quandry and of procuring peace and that is to let his wife control the this abdication sets him free 
 then his wife busies herself grows passionately fond of handling coin gets her fingers covered with verdigris in the process undertakes the education of tenants and the training of farmers convokes lawyers presides over notaries harangues scriveners visits limbs of the law follows lawsuits draws up leases dictates contracts feels herself the sovereign sells buys regulates promises and compromises binds fast and annuls yields concedes and retrocedes arranges disarranges hoards lavishes she commits follies a supreme and personal delight and that consoles her 
 while her husband disdains her she has the satisfaction of ruining her husband this theory m gillenormand had himself applied and it had become his history 
 his second administered his fortune in such a manner that one fine day when m gillenormand found himself a widower there remained to him just sufficient to live on by sinking nearly the whole of it in an annuity of fifteen thousand francs of which would expire with him he had not hesitated on this point not being anxious to leave a property behind him 
 besides he had noticed that patrimonies are subject to adventures and for instance become national property he had been present at the avatars of consolidated three per cents and he had no great faith in the great book of the public debt all the rue quincampois he said 
 his house in the rue belonged to him as we have already stated he had two servants a male and a female 
 when a servant entered his establishment m gillenormand him 
 he bestowed on the men the name of their province 
 nimois comtois poitevin picard his last valet was a big foundered fellow of who was incapable of running twenty paces but as he had been born at bayonne m gillenormand called him basque 
 all the female servants in his house were called nicolette even the magnon of whom we shall hear more farther on one day a haughty cook a cordon bleu of the lofty race of porters presented herself how much wages do you want a month asked m gillenormand thirty francs 
 what is your name 
 olympie 
 you shall have fifty francs and you shall be called nicolette

 pierre drove to marya to tell her of the fulfillment of her wish that kuragin should be banished from moscow the whole house was in a state of alarm and commotion natasha was very ill having as marya dmitrievna told him in secret poisoned herself the night after she had been told that anatole was married with some arsenic she had stealthily procured after swallowing a little she had been so frightened that she woke sonya and told her what she had done the necessary antidotes had been administered in time and she was now out of danger though still so weak that it was out of the question to move her to the country and so the countess had been sent for pierre saw the distracted count and sonya who had a face but he could not see natasha 
 pierre dined at the club that day and heard on all sides gossip about the attempted abduction of rostova he resolutely denied these rumors assuring everyone that nothing had happened except that his had proposed to her and been refused it seemed to pierre that it was his duty to conceal the whole affair and reputation 
 he was awaiting prince return with dread and went every day to the old for news of him 
 old prince bolkonski heard all the rumors current in the town from mademoiselle bourienne and had read the note to princess mary in which natasha had broken off her engagement he seemed in better spirits than usual and awaited his son with great impatience 
 some days after departure pierre received a note from prince andrew informing him of his arrival and asking him to come to see him 
 as soon as he reached moscow prince andrew had received from his father note to princess mary breaking off her engagement mademoiselle bourienne had purloined it from princess mary and given it to the old prince and he heard from him the story of elopement with additions 
 prince andrew had arrived in the evening and pierre came to see him next morning pierre expected to find prince andrew in almost the same state as natasha and was therefore surprised on entering the drawing room to hear him in the study talking in a loud animated voice about some intrigue going on in petersburg the old voice and another now and then interrupted him princess mary came out to meet pierre she sighed looking toward the door of the room where prince andrew was evidently intending to express her sympathy with his sorrow but pierre saw by her face that she was glad both at what had happened and at the way her brother had taken the news of faithlessness 
 he says he expected it she remarked i know his pride will not let him express his feelings but still he has taken it better far better than i expected evidently it had to be 
 but is it possible that all is really ended asked pierre 
 princess mary looked at him with astonishment she did not understand how he could ask such a question pierre went into the study prince andrew greatly changed and plainly in better health but with a fresh horizontal wrinkle between his brows stood in civilian dress facing his father and prince meshcherski warmly disputing and vigorously gesticulating the conversation was about speranski the news of whose sudden exile and alleged treachery had just reached moscow 
 now he is censured and accused by all who were enthusiastic about him a month ago prince andrew was saying and by those who were unable to understand his aims to judge a man who is in disfavor and to throw on him all the blame of other mistakes is very easy but i maintain that if anything good has been accomplished in this reign it was done by him by him alone 
 he paused at the sight of pierre his face quivered and immediately assumed a vindictive expression 
 posterity will do him justice he concluded and at once turned to pierre 
 well how are you still getting stouter he said with animation but the new wrinkle on his forehead deepened yes i am well he said in answer to question and smiled 
 to pierre that smile said plainly i am well but my health is now of no use to anyone 
 after a few words to pierre about the awful roads from the polish frontier about people he had met in switzerland who knew pierre and about m dessalles whom he had brought from abroad to be his tutor prince andrew again joined warmly in the conversation about speranski which was still going on between the two old men 
 if there were treason or proofs of secret relations with napoleon they would have been made public he said with warmth and haste i do not and never did like speranski personally but i like justice 
 pierre now recognized in his friend a need with which he was only too familiar to get excited and to have arguments about extraneous matters in order to stifle thoughts that were too oppressive and too intimate when prince meshcherski had left prince andrew took arm and asked him into the room that had been assigned him a bed had been made up there and some open portmanteaus and trunks stood about prince andrew went to one and took out a small casket from which he drew a packet wrapped in paper he did it all silently and very quickly he stood up and coughed his face was gloomy and his lips compressed 
 forgive me for troubling you 
 pierre saw that prince andrew was going to speak of natasha and his broad face expressed pity and sympathy this expression irritated prince andrew and in a determined ringing and unpleasant tone he continued 
 i have received a refusal from countess rostova and have heard reports of your having sought her hand or something of that kind is that true 
 both true and untrue pierre began but prince andrew interrupted him 
 here are her letters and her portrait said he 
 he took the packet from the table and handed it to pierre 
 give this to the countess if you see her 
 she is very ill said pierre 
 then she is here still said prince andrew and prince kuragin he added quickly 
 he left long ago she has been at door 
 i much regret her illness said prince andrew and he smiled like his father coldly maliciously and unpleasantly 
 so monsieur kuragin has not honored countess rostova with his hand said prince andrew and he snorted several times 
 he could not marry for he was married already said pierre 
 prince andrew laughed disagreeably again reminding one of his father 
 and where is your now if i may ask he said 
 he has gone to peters but i know said pierre 
 well it matter said prince andrew tell countess rostova that she was and is perfectly free and that i wish her all that is good 
 pierre took the packet prince andrew as if trying to remember whether he had something more to say or waiting to see if pierre would say anything looked fixedly at him 
 i say do you remember our discussion in petersburg asked pierre about 
 yes returned prince andrew hastily i said that a fallen woman should be forgiven but i say i could forgive her i 
 but can this be compared said pierre 
 prince andrew interrupted him and cried sharply yes ask her hand again be magnanimous and so on yes that would be very noble but i am unable to follow in that footsteps if you wish to be my friend never speak to me of that of all that well so give her the packet 
 pierre left the room and went to the old prince and princess mary 
 the old man seemed livelier than usual princess mary was the same as always but beneath her sympathy for her brother pierre noticed her satisfaction that the engagement had been broken off looking at them pierre realized what contempt and animosity they all felt for the rostovs and that it was impossible in their presence even to mention the name of her who could give up prince andrew for anyone else 
 at dinner the talk turned on the war the approach of which was becoming evident prince andrew talked incessantly arguing now with his father now with the swiss tutor dessalles and showing an unnatural animation the cause of which pierre so well understood

 in which magnon and her two children are seen 
 with m gillenormand sorrow was converted into wrath he was furious at being in despair 
 he had all sorts of prejudices and took all sorts of liberties 
 one of the facts of which his exterior relief and his internal satisfaction was composed was as we have just hinted that he had remained a brisk spark and that he passed energetically for such 
 this he called having royal renown this royal renown sometimes drew down upon him singular windfalls one day there was brought to him in a basket as though it had been a basket of oysters a stout newly born boy who was yelling like the deuce and duly wrapped in which a dismissed six months previously attributed to him m gillenormand had at that time fully completed his year 
 indignation and uproar in the establishment and whom did that bold hussy think she could persuade to believe that what audacity 
 what an abominable calumny 
 m gillenormand himself was not at all enraged 
 he gazed at the brat with the amiable smile of a good man who is flattered by the calumny and said in an aside well what now 
 the matter 
 you are finely taken aback and really you are excessively ignorant 
 m le duc the bastard of his majesty charles ix married a silly jade of fifteen when he was m virginal marquis brother to the cardinal de sourdis archbishop of bordeaux had at the age of by the maid of madame la presidente jacquin a son a real child of love who became a chevalier of malta and a counsellor of state one of the great men of this century the abbe tabaraud is the son of a man of there is nothing out of the ordinary in these things 
 and then the bible upon that i declare that this little gentleman is none of mine let him be taken care of 
 it is not his fault 
 this manner of procedure was the woman whose name was magnon sent him another parcel in the following year 
 it was a boy again thereupon m gillenormand capitulated 
 he sent the two brats back to their mother promising to pay eighty francs a month for their maintenance on the condition that the said mother would not do so any more 
 he added 
 i insist upon it that the mother shall treat them well 
 i shall go to see them from time to time and this he did 
 he had had a brother who was a priest and who had been rector of the academy of poitiers for three and thirty years and had died at i lost him young said he this brother of whom but little memory remains was a peaceable miser who being a priest thought himself bound to bestow alms on the poor whom he met but he never gave them anything except bad or demonetized sous thereby discovering a means of going to hell by way of paradise 
 as for m gillenormand the elder he never haggled over his but gave gladly and nobly he was kindly abrupt charitable and if he had been rich his turn of mind would have been magnificent 
 he desired that all which concerned him should be done in a grand manner even his rogueries 
 one day having been cheated by a business man in a matter of inheritance in a gross and apparent manner he uttered this solemn exclamation 
 that was indecently done i am really ashamed of this pilfering 
 everything has degenerated in this century even the rascals

 that same evening pierre went to the rostovs to fulfill the commission entrusted to him natasha was in bed the count at the club and pierre after giving the letters to sonya went to marya dmitrievna who was interested to know how prince andrew had taken the news ten minutes later sonya came to marya dmitrievna 
 natasha insists on seeing count peter kirilovich said she 
 but how are we to take him up to her the room there has not been tidied up 
 no she has dressed and gone into the drawing room said sonya 
 marya dmitrievna only shrugged her shoulders 
 when will her mother come she has worried me to death now mind tell her everything said she to pierre one the heart to scold her she is so much to be pitied so much to be pitied 
 natasha was standing in the middle of the drawing room emaciated with a pale set face but not at all shamefaced as pierre expected to find her when he appeared at the door she grew flurried evidently undecided whether to go to meet him or to wait till he came up 
 pierre hastened to her he thought she would give him her hand as usual but she stepping up to him stopped breathing heavily her arms hanging lifelessly just in the pose she used to stand in when she went to the middle of the ballroom to sing but with quite a different expression of face 
 peter kirilovich she began rapidly prince bolkonski was your friend is your friend she corrected herself it seemed to her that everything that had once been must now be different he told me once to apply to you 
 pierre sniffed as he looked at her but did not speak till then he had reproached her in his heart and tried to despise her but he now felt so sorry for her that there was no room in his soul for reproach 
 he is here now tell him to for forgive me she stopped and breathed still more quickly but did not shed tears 
 yes i will tell him answered pierre but 
 he did not know what to say 
 natasha was evidently dismayed at the thought of what he might think she had meant 
 no i know all is over she said hurriedly no that can never be only tormented by the wrong i have done him tell him only that i beg him to forgive forgive forgive me for everything 
 she trembled all over and sat down on a chair 
 a sense of pity he had never before known overflowed heart 
 i will tell him i will tell him everything once more said pierre but i should like to know one thing 
 know what eyes asked 
 i should like to know did you love pierre did not know how to refer to anatole and flushed at the thought of him did you love that bad man 
 call him bad said natasha but i know know at all 
 she began to cry and a still greater sense of pity tenderness and love welled up in pierre he felt the tears trickle under his spectacles and hoped they would not be noticed 
 we speak of it any more my dear said pierre and his gentle cordial tone suddenly seemed very strange to natasha 
 we speak of it my dear tell him everything but one thing i beg of you consider me your friend and if you want help advice or simply to open your heart to someone not now but when your mind is clearer think of me he took her hand and kissed it i shall be happy if in my power 
 pierre grew confused 
 speak to me like that i am not worth it exclaimed natasha and turned to leave the room but pierre held her hand 
 he knew he had something more to say to her but when he said it he was amazed at his own words 
 stop stop you have your whole life before you said he to her 
 before me no all is over for me she replied with shame and 
 all over he repeated if i were not myself but the handsomest cleverest and best man in the world and were free i would this moment ask on my knees for your hand and your love 
 for the first time for many days natasha wept tears of gratitude and tenderness and glancing at pierre she went out of the room 
 pierre too when she had gone almost ran into the anteroom restraining tears of tenderness and joy that choked him and without finding the sleeves of his fur cloak threw it on and got into his sleigh 
 where to now your excellency asked the coachman 
 where to pierre asked himself where can i go now surely not to the club or to pay calls all men seemed so pitiful so poor in comparison with this feeling of tenderness and love he experienced in comparison with that softened grateful last look she had given him through her tears 
 home said pierre and despite degrees of frost fahrenheit he threw open the bearskin cloak from his broad chest and inhaled the air with joy 
 it was clear and frosty above the dirty streets above the black roofs stretched the dark starry sky only looking up at the sky did pierre cease to feel how sordid and humiliating were all mundane things compared with the heights to which his soul had just been raised at the entrance to the arbat square an immense expanse of dark starry sky presented itself to his eyes almost in the center of it above the prechistenka boulevard surrounded and sprinkled on all sides by stars but distinguished from them all by its nearness to the earth its white light and its long uplifted tail shone the enormous and brilliant comet of l the comet which was said to portend all kinds of woes and the end of the world in pierre however that comet with its long luminous tail aroused no feeling of fear on the contrary he gazed joyfully his eyes moist with tears at this bright comet which having traveled in its orbit with inconceivable velocity through immeasurable space seemed suddenly like an arrow piercing the earth to remain fixed in a chosen spot vigorously holding its tail erect shining and displaying its white light amid countless other scintillating stars it seemed to pierre that this comet fully responded to what was passing in his own softened and uplifted soul now blossoming into a new life

 receive no one except in the evening 
 such was m gillenormand who had not lost his hair which was gray rather than which was always dressed in ears 
 to sum up he was venerable in spite of all this 
 he had something of the eighteenth century about him frivolous and great 
 in and during the early years of the restoration m gillenormand who was still was only in the faubourg saint germain rue servandoni near he had only retired to the marais when he quitted society long after attaining the age of eighty 
 and on abandoning society he had immured himself in his habits the principal one and that which was invariable was to keep his door absolutely closed during the day and never to receive any one whatever except in the evening 
 he dined at five and after that his door was open 
 that had been the fashion of his century and he would not swerve from it 
 the day is vulgar said he and deserves only a closed shutter 
 fashionable people only light up their minds when the zenith lights up its stars 
 and he barricaded himself against every one even had it been the king himself this was the antiquated elegance of his day

 chapter i 
 
 from the close of the year intensified arming and concentrating of the forces of western europe began and in these forces millions of men reckoning those transporting and feeding the army moved from the west eastwards to the russian frontier toward which since russian forces had been similarly drawn on the twelfth of june the forces of western europe crossed the russian frontier and war began that is an event took place opposed to human reason and to human nature millions of men perpetrated against one another such innumerable crimes frauds treacheries thefts forgeries issues of false money burglaries incendiarisms and murders as in whole centuries are not recorded in the annals of all the law courts of the world but which those who committed them did not at the time regard as being crimes 
 what produced this extraordinary occurrence what were its causes the historians tell us with naive assurance that its causes were the wrongs inflicted on the duke of oldenburg the nonobservance of the continental system the ambition of napoleon the firmness of alexander the mistakes of the diplomatists and so on 
 consequently it would only have been necessary for metternich rumyantsev or talleyrand between a levee and an evening party to have taken proper pains and written a more adroit note or for napoleon to have written to alexander my respected brother i consent to restore the duchy to the duke of oldenburg and there would have been no war 
 we can understand that the matter seemed like that to contemporaries it naturally seemed to napoleon that the war was caused by intrigues as in fact he said on the island of st helena it naturally seemed to members of the english parliament that the cause of the war was ambition to the duke of oldenburg that the cause of the war was the violence done to him to businessmen that the cause of the way was the continental system which was ruining europe to the generals and old soldiers that the chief reason for the war was the necessity of giving them employment to the legitimists of that day that it was the need of les bons principes and to the diplomatists of that time that it all resulted from the fact that the alliance between russia and austria in had not been sufficiently well concealed from napoleon and from the awkward wording of memorandum no it is natural that these and a countless and infinite quantity of other reasons the number depending on the endless diversity of points of view presented themselves to the men of that day but to us to posterity who view the thing that happened in all its magnitude and perceive its plain and terrible meaning these causes seem insufficient to us it is incomprehensible that millions of christian men killed and tortured each other either because napoleon was ambitious or alexander was firm or because policy was astute or the duke of oldenburg wronged we cannot grasp what connection such circumstances have with the actual fact of slaughter and violence why because the duke was wronged thousands of men from the other side of europe killed and ruined the people of smolensk and moscow and were killed by them 
 to us their descendants who are not historians and are not carried away by the process of research and can therefore regard the event with unclouded common sense an incalculable number of causes present themselves the deeper we delve in search of these causes the more of them we find and each separate cause or whole series of causes appears to us equally valid in itself and equally false by its insignificance compared to the magnitude of the events and by its impotence apart from the cooperation of all the other coincident causes to occasion the event to us the wish or objection of this or that french corporal to serve a second term appears as much a cause as refusal to withdraw his troops beyond the vistula and to restore the duchy of oldenburg for had he not wished to serve and had a second a third and a thousandth corporal and private also refused there would have been so many less men in army and the war could not have occurred 
 had napoleon not taken offense at the demand that he should withdraw beyond the vistula and not ordered his troops to advance there would have been no war but had all his sergeants objected to serving a second term then also there could have been no war nor could there have been a war had there been no english intrigues and no duke of oldenburg and had alexander not felt insulted and had there not been an autocratic government in russia or a revolution in france and a subsequent dictatorship and empire or all the things that produced the french revolution and so on without each of these causes nothing could have happened so all these causes myriads of causes coincided to bring it about and so there was no one cause for that occurrence but it had to occur because it had to millions of men renouncing their human feelings and reason had to go from west to east to slay their fellows just as some centuries previously hordes of men had come from the east to the west slaying their fellows 
 the actions of napoleon and alexander on whose words the event seemed to hang were as little voluntary as the actions of any soldier who was drawn into the campaign by lot or by conscription this could not be otherwise for in order that the will of napoleon and alexander on whom the event seemed to depend should be carried out the concurrence of innumerable circumstances was needed without any one of which the event could not have taken place it was necessary that millions of men in whose hands lay the real power the soldiers who fired or transported provisions and guns should consent to carry out the will of these weak individuals and should have been induced to do so by an infinite number of diverse and complex causes 
 we are forced to fall back on fatalism as an explanation of irrational events that is to say events the reasonableness of which we do not understand the more we try to explain such events in history reasonably the more unreasonable and incomprehensible do they become to us 
 each man lives for himself using his freedom to attain his personal aims and feels with his whole being that he can now do or abstain from doing this or that action but as soon as he has done it that action performed at a certain moment in time becomes irrevocable and belongs to history in which it has not a free but a predestined significance 
 there are two sides to the life of every man his individual life which is the more free the more abstract its interests and his elemental hive life in which he inevitably obeys laws laid down for him 
 man lives consciously for himself but is an unconscious instrument in the attainment of the historic universal aims of humanity a deed done is irrevocable and its result coinciding in time with the actions of millions of other men assumes an historic significance the higher a man stands on the social ladder the more people he is connected with and the more power he has over others the more evident is the predestination and inevitability of his every action 
 the heart is in the hands of the lord 
 a king is slave 
 history that is the unconscious general hive life of mankind uses every moment of the life of kings as a tool for its own purposes 
 though napoleon at that time in was more convinced than ever that it depended on him verser ou ne pas verser le sang de ses peuples as alexander expressed it in the last letter he wrote him he had never been so much in the grip of inevitable laws which compelled him while thinking that he was acting on his own volition to perform for the hive life that is to say for history whatever had to be performed 
 to shed or not to shed the blood of his peoples 
 the people of the west moved eastwards to slay their fellow men and by the law of coincidence thousands of minute causes fitted in and to produce that movement and war reproaches for the nonobservance of the continental system the duke of wrongs the movement of troops into prussia undertaken as it seemed to napoleon only for the purpose of securing an armed peace the french love and habit of war coinciding with his inclinations allurement by the grandeur of the preparations and the expenditure on those preparations and the need of obtaining advantages to compensate for that expenditure the intoxicating honors he received in dresden the diplomatic negotiations which in the opinion of contemporaries were carried on with a sincere desire to attain peace but which only wounded the of both sides and millions and millions of other causes that adapted themselves to the event that was happening or coincided with it 
 when an apple has ripened and falls why does it fall because of its attraction to the earth because its stalk withers because it is dried by the sun because it grows heavier because the wind shakes it or because the boy standing below wants to eat it 
 nothing is the cause all this is only the coincidence of conditions in which all vital organic and elemental events occur and the botanist who finds that the apple falls because the cellular tissue decays and so forth is equally right with the child who stands under the tree and says the apple fell because he wanted to eat it and prayed for it equally right or wrong is he who says that napoleon went to moscow because he wanted to and perished because alexander desired his destruction and he who says that an undermined hill weighing a million tons fell because the last navvy struck it for the last time with his mattock in historic events the great men are labels giving names to events and like labels they have but the smallest connection with the event itself 
 every act of theirs which appears to them an act of their own will is in an historical sense involuntary and is related to the whole course of history and predestined from eternity

 two do not make a pair 
 we have just spoken of m two daughters 
 they had come into the world ten years apart 
 in their youth they had borne very little resemblance to each other either in character or countenance and had also been as little like sisters to each other as possible 
 the youngest had a charming soul which turned towards all that belongs to the light was occupied with flowers with verses with music which fluttered away into glorious space enthusiastic ethereal and was wedded from her very youth in ideal to a vague and heroic figure 
 the elder had also her chimera she espied in the azure some very wealthy purveyor a contractor a splendidly stupid husband a million made man or even a prefect the receptions of the prefecture an usher in the antechamber with a chain on his neck official balls the harangues of the to be madame la this had created a whirlwind in her imagination 
 thus the two sisters strayed each in her own dream at the epoch when they were young girls both had wings the one like an angel the other like a goose 
 no ambition is ever fully realized here below at least no paradise becomes terrestrial in our day 
 the younger wedded the man of her dreams but she died 
 the elder did not marry at all 
 at the moment when she makes her entrance into this history which we are relating she was an antique virtue an incombustible prude with one of the sharpest noses and one of the most obtuse minds that it is possible to see 
 a characteristic detail outside of her immediate family no one had ever known her first name she was called mademoiselle gillenormand the elder 
 in the matter of cant mademoiselle gillenormand could have given points to a miss 
 her modesty was carried to the other extreme of blackness 
 she cherished a frightful memory of her life one day a man had beheld her garter 
 age had only served to accentuate this pitiless modesty 
 her guimpe was never sufficiently opaque and never ascended sufficiently high she multiplied clasps and pins where no one would have dreamed of looking 
 the peculiarity of prudery is to place all the more sentinels in proportion as the fortress is the less menaced 
 nevertheless let him who can explain these antique mysteries of innocence she allowed an officer of the lancers her grand nephew named theodule to embrace her without displeasure 
 in spite of this favored lancer the label 
 prude under which we have classed her suited her to absolute perfection 
 mademoiselle gillenormand was a sort of twilight soul 
 prudery is a and a 
 to prudery she added bigotry a lining 
 she belonged to the society of the virgin wore a white veil on certain festivals mumbled special orisons revered the holy blood venerated the sacred heart remained for hours in contemplation before a altar in a chapel which was inaccessible to the rank and file of the faithful and there allowed her soul to soar among little clouds of marble and through great rays of gilded wood 
 she had a chapel friend an ancient virgin like herself named mademoiselle vaubois who was a positive blockhead and beside whom mademoiselle gillenormand had the pleasure of being an eagle 
 beyond the agnus dei and ave maria mademoiselle vaubois had no knowledge of anything except of the different ways of making preserves 
 mademoiselle vaubois perfect in her style was the ermine of stupidity without a single spot of intelligence 
 let us say it plainly mademoiselle gillenormand had gained rather than lost as she grew older 
 this is the case with passive natures she had never been malicious which is relative kindness and then years wear away the angles and the softening which comes with time had come to her 
 she was melancholy with an obscure sadness of which she did not herself know the secret 
 there breathed from her whole person the stupor of a life that was finished and which had never had a beginning 
 she kept house for her father 
 m gillenormand had his daughter near him as we have seen that monseigneur bienvenu had his sister with him 
 these households comprised of an old man and an old spinster are not rare and always have the touching aspect of two weaknesses leaning on each other for support 
 there was also in this house between this elderly spinster and this old man a child a little boy who was always trembling and mute in the presence of m gillenormand 
 m gillenormand never addressed this child except in a severe voice and sometimes with uplifted cane 
 here sir rascal scoundrel come here answer me you scamp 
 just let me see you you etc etc 
 he idolized him 
 this was his grandson 
 we shall meet with this child again later on

 chapter ii 
 
 on the of may napoleon left dresden where he had spent three weeks surrounded by a court that included princes dukes kings and even an emperor before leaving napoleon showed favor to the emperor kings and princes who had deserved it reprimanded the kings and princes with whom he was dissatisfied presented pearls and diamonds of his own that is which he had taken from other kings to the empress of austria and having as his historian tells us tenderly embraced the empress marie louise who regarded him as her husband though he had left another wife in paris left her grieved by the parting which she seemed hardly able to bear though the diplomatists still firmly believed in the possibility of peace and worked zealously to that end and though the emperor napoleon himself wrote a letter to alexander calling him monsieur mon frere and sincerely assured him that he did not want war and would always love and honor him yet he set off to join his army and at every station gave fresh orders to accelerate the movement of his troops from west to east he went in a traveling coach with six horses surrounded by pages and an escort along the road to posen thorn danzig and konigsberg at each of these towns thousands of people met him with excitement and enthusiasm 
 the army was moving from west to east and relays of six horses carried him in the same direction on the tenth of june coming up with the army he spent the night in apartments prepared for him on 
 the estate of a polish count in the vilkavisski forest 
 old style 
 next day overtaking the army he went in a carriage to the niemen and changing into a polish uniform he drove to the riverbank in order to select a place for the crossing 
 seeing on the other side some cossacks les cosaques and the steppes in the midst of which lay the holy city of moscow moscou la ville sainte the capital of a realm such as the scythia into which alexander the great had marched napoleon unexpectedly and contrary alike to strategic and diplomatic considerations ordered an advance and the next day his army began to cross the niemen 
 early in the morning of the twelfth of june he came out of his tent which was pitched that day on the steep left bank of the niemen and looked through a spyglass at the streams of his troops pouring out of the vilkavisski forest and flowing over the three bridges thrown across the river the troops knowing of the presence were on the lookout for him and when they caught sight of a figure in an overcoat and a cocked hat standing apart from his suite in front of his tent on the hill they threw up their caps and shouted vive and one after another poured in a ceaseless stream out of the vast forest that had concealed them and separating flowed on and on by the three bridges to the other side 
 now go into action oh when he takes it in hand himself things get hot by heaven there he is vive so these are the steppes of asia a nasty country all the same au revoir beauche keep the best palace in moscow for you au revoir good luck did you see the emperor vive preur if they make me governor of india gerard make you minister of kashmir settled vive hurrah hurrah hurrah the cossacks those rascals see how they run vive there he is do you see him seen him twice as i see you now the little corporal i saw him give the cross to one of the veterans vive came the voices of men old and young of most diverse characters and social positions on the faces of all was one common expression of joy at the commencement of the campaign and of rapture and devotion to the man in the gray coat who was standing on the hill 
 on the thirteenth of june a rather small thoroughbred arab horse was brought to napoleon he mounted it and rode at a gallop to one of the bridges over the niemen deafened continually by incessant and rapturous acclamations which he evidently endured only because it was impossible to forbid the soldiers to express their love of him by such shouting but the shouting which accompanied him everywhere disturbed him and distracted him from the military cares that had occupied him from the time he joined the army he rode across one of the swaying pontoon bridges to the farther side turned sharply to the left and galloped in the direction of kovno preceded by enraptured mounted chasseurs of the guard who breathless with delight galloped ahead to clear a path for him through the troops on reaching the broad river viliya he stopped near a regiment of polish uhlans stationed by the river 
 vivat shouted the poles ecstatically breaking their ranks and pressing against one another to see him 
 napoleon looked up and down the river dismounted and sat down on a log that lay on the bank at a mute sign from him a telescope was handed him which he rested on the back of a happy page who had run up to him and he gazed at the opposite bank then he became absorbed in a map laid out on the logs without lifting his head he said something and two of his galloped off to the polish uhlans 
 what what did he say was heard in the ranks of the polish uhlans when one of the rode up to them 
 the order was to find a ford and to cross the river the colonel of the polish uhlans a handsome old man flushed and fumbling in his speech from excitement asked the whether he would be permitted to swim the river with his uhlans instead of seeking a ford in evident fear of refusal like a boy asking for permission to get on a horse he begged to be allowed to swim across the river before the eyes the replied that probably the emperor would not be displeased at this excess of zeal 
 as soon as the had said this the old mustached officer with happy face and sparkling eyes raised his saber shouted vivat and commanding the uhlans to follow him spurred his horse and galloped into the river he gave an angry thrust to his horse which had grown restive under him and plunged into the water heading for the deepest part where the current was swift hundreds of uhlans galloped in after him it was cold and uncanny in the rapid current in the middle of the stream and the uhlans caught hold of one another as they fell off their horses some of the horses were drowned and some of the men the others tried to swim on some in the saddle and some clinging to their horses manes they tried to make their way forward to the opposite bank and though there was a ford one third of a mile away were proud that they were swimming and drowning in this river under the eyes of the man who sat on the log and was not even looking at what they were doing when the having returned and choosing an opportune moment ventured to draw the attention to the devotion of the poles to his person the little man in the gray overcoat got up and having summoned berthier began pacing up and down the bank with him giving him instructions and occasionally glancing disapprovingly at the drowning uhlans who distracted his attention 
 for him it was no new conviction that his presence in any part of the world from africa to the steppes of muscovy alike was enough to dumfound people and impel them to insane he called for his horse and rode to his quarters 
 some forty uhlans were drowned in the river though boats were sent to their assistance the majority struggled back to the bank from which they had started the colonel and some of his men got across and with difficulty clambered out on the further bank and as soon as they had got out in their soaked and streaming clothes they shouted vivat and looked ecstatically at the spot where napoleon had been but where he no longer was and at that moment considered themselves happy 
 that evening between issuing one order that the forged russian paper money prepared for use in russia should be delivered as quickly as possible and another that a saxon should be shot on whom a letter containing information about the orders to the french army had been found napoleon also gave instructions that the polish colonel who had needlessly plunged into the river should be enrolled in the legion of which napoleon was himself the head

 of atheism 
 i had rather believe all the fables in the legend and the talmud and the alcoran than that this universal frame is without a mind and therefore god never wrought miracle to convince atheism because his ordinary works convince it it is true that a little philosophy inclineth mind to atheism but depth in philosophy bringelh 
 minds about to religion for while the mind of man looketh upon second causes scattered it may sometimes rest in them and go no further but when it beholdeth the chain of them confederate and linked together it must needs fly to providence and deity nay even mat school which is most accused of atheism doth most demonstrate 
 religion that is the school of leucippus and democritus and epicurus 
 for it is a thousand times more credible that four mutable elements and one immutable fifth essence duly and eternally placed needs no god than mat an army of infinite small proportions or seeds unplaced should have produced this order and beauty without 
 a divine marshal 
 the scripture saith the fool hath said in his heart mere is no 
 god it is not said the fool hath thought in his heart so as he rather saith it by rote to himself as that he would have than hat he can thoroughly believe it or be persuaded of it for none deny there is a god but those for whom it maketh that there were no god it appeareth in nothing more mat atheism is radher in die 
 lip man in die heart of man man by this dial atheists will ever be talking of that their opinion as if they fainted in it within themselves and would be glad to be strengthened by me consent of others nay more you shall have atheists strive to get disciples as it faredh with other sects and which is most of all you shall have of mem mat will suffer for adieism and not recant whereas if they did truly 
 think mat mere were no such dung as god why should diey trouble themselves epicurus is charged that he did but dissemble for his sake when he affirmed there were blessed natures but such as enjoyed themselves without having respect to the 
 government of the world 
 wherein they say he did temporise though in secret he 
 thought there was no god but certainly he is traduced for his words are noble and divine non deos vulgi negare profanum sed vulgi opines diis applicare prcfanum 
 plato could have said no more and although he had the confidence to deny the administration he had not the power to deny the nature the indians of the west have names for their particular gods though they have no name for god as if the heathens should have had the names jupiter apollo mars c but not the word deus which shows that even those barbarous people have the notion though they 
 have not the latitude and extent of it so that against atheists the very savages take part with the very subtlest philosophers the contemplative atheist is rare a diagoras a bion a lucian perhaps and some others and yet they seem to be more than they are for that all that impugn a received religion or superstition are by the adverse part branded with the name of atheists 
 but me great atheists indeed are hypocrites which are ever handling holy things but without feeling so as they must needs be cauterised in the end the causes of atheism are divisions in religion if they be many for any one main division addeth zeal to both sides but many divisions introduce atheism 
 another is scandal of priests when it is come to that which st bernard saith mon est ian dicere ut populus sic nes sacerdos a third is custom of profane scoffing in holy 
 matters which doth by little and little deface the reverence of religion and lastly learned times specially with peace and prosperity for troubles and adversities do more bow minds to religion 
 they that deny a god destroy nobility for certainly man is of kin to the beasts by his body and if he be not of kin to god by his spirit he is a base and ignoble creature it destroys likewise magnanimity and the raising of human nature for take an example of a dog and mark what a generosity and courage he will put on when he finds himself maintained by a man who to him is in stead of a god or melior natura which courage is manifestly such as that creature without that confidence of a better nature than his own could never attain 
 so man when he resteth and assureth himself upon divine protection and favour gathereth a force and faith which human nature in itself could not obtain 
 therefore as atheism is in all respects hateful so in this that it depriveth human nature of the means to exalt itself above human frailty as it is in particular persons so it is in nations never was there such a state for magnanimity as rome of this state hear what cicero saith quam volumus licet patres conscripti nos amemus tamen nec numero hispans nec robore gallos mec calliditate poems nec 
 artibus denique hoc ipso huius gentis et terrae domestico nativoque sensu itlos ipsos et latinos sed pietate ac religione atque hac una sapientia quod deorum imortalium numine omnia regi gubernarique perspeximus ormes gentes nationesque superavimus

 chapter i 
 
 the evening of a day of walking 
 early in the month of october about an hour before sunset a man who was travelling on foot entered the little town of d the few inhabitants who were at their windows or on their thresholds at the moment stared at this traveller with a sort of uneasiness it was difficult to encounter a wayfarer of more wretched appearance he was a man of medium stature thickset and robust in the prime of life 
 he might have been or years old a cap with a drooping leather visor partly concealed his face burned and tanned by sun and wind and dripping with perspiration his shirt of coarse yellow linen fastened at the neck by a small silver anchor permitted a view of his hairy breast 
 he had a cravat twisted into a string trousers of blue drilling worn and threadbare white on one knee and torn on the other an old gray tattered blouse patched on one of the elbows with a bit of green cloth sewed on with twine a tightly packed soldier knapsack well buckled and perfectly new on his back an enormous knotty stick in his hand shoes on his stockingless feet a shaved head and a long beard 
 the sweat the heat the journey on foot the dust added i know not what sordid quality to this dilapidated whole 
 his hair was closely cut yet bristling for it had begun to grow a little and did not seem to have been cut for some time 
 no one knew him 
 he was evidently only a chance whence came he 
 from the south from the seashore perhaps for he made his entrance into d by the same street which seven months previously had witnessed the passage of the emperor napoleon on his way from cannes to paris 
 this man must have been walking all day he seemed very much fatigued 
 some women of the ancient market town which is situated below the city had seen him pause beneath the trees of the boulevard gassendi and drink at the fountain which stands at the end of the promenade 
 he must have been very thirsty for the children who followed him saw him stop again for a drink two hundred paces further on at the fountain in the 
 on arriving at the corner of the rue poichevert he turned to the left and directed his steps toward the he entered then came out a quarter of an hour later 
 a gendarme was seated near the door on the stone bench which general drouot had mounted on the th of march to read to the frightened throng of the inhabitants of d the proclamation of the gulf juan 
 the man pulled off his cap and humbly saluted the gendarme 
 the gendarme without replying to his salute stared attentively at him followed him for a while with his eyes and then entered the 
 there then existed at d a fine inn at the sign of the cross of colbas 
 this inn had for a landlord a certain jacquin labarre a man of consideration in the town on account of his relationship to another labarre who kept the inn of the three dauphins in grenoble and had served in the guides 
 at the time of the landing many rumors had circulated throughout the country with regard to this inn of the three dauphins 
 it was said that general bertrand disguised as a carter had made frequent trips thither in the month of january and that he had distributed crosses of honor to the soldiers and handfuls of gold to the citizens 
 the truth is that when the emperor entered grenoble he had refused to install himself at the hotel of the prefecture he had thanked the mayor saying i am going to the house of a brave man of my acquaintance and he had betaken himself to the three dauphins 
 this glory of the labarre of the three dauphins was reflected upon the labarre of the cross of colbas at a distance of five and twenty leagues it was said of him in the town that is the cousin of the man of grenoble 
 the man bent his steps towards this inn which was the best in the he entered the kitchen which opened on a level with the street 
 all the stoves were lighted a huge fire blazed gayly in the fireplace 
 the host who was also the chief cook was going from one to another very busily superintending an excellent dinner designed for the wagoners whose loud talking conversation and laughter were audible from an adjoining apartment any one who has travelled knows that there is no one who indulges in better cheer than wagoners 
 a fat marmot flanked by white partridges and was turning on a long spit before the fire on the stove two huge carps from lake lauzet and a trout from lake alloz were cooking 
 the host hearing the door open and seeing a newcomer enter said without raising his eyes from his stoves 
 what do you wish sir 
 food and lodging said the man 
 nothing easier replied the host 
 at that moment he turned his head took in the appearance with a single glance and added by paying for it 
 the man drew a large leather purse from the pocket of his blouse and answered i have money 
 in that case we are at your service said the host 
 the man put his purse back in his pocket removed his knapsack from his back put it on the ground near the door retained his stick in his hand and seated himself on a low stool close to the fire d is in the mountains 
 the evenings are cold there in october 
 but as the host went back and forth he scrutinized the traveller 
 will dinner be ready soon said the man 
 immediately replied the landlord 
 while the newcomer was warming himself before the fire with his back turned the worthy host jacquin labarre drew a pencil from his pocket then tore off the corner of an old newspaper which was lying on a small table near the window 
 on the white margin he wrote a line or two folded it without sealing and then intrusted this scrap of paper to a child who seemed to serve him in the capacity both of scullion and lackey 
 the landlord whispered a word in the ear and the child set off on a run in the direction of the 
 the traveller saw nothing of all this 
 once more he inquired will dinner be ready soon 
 immediately responded the host 
 the child returned 
 he brought back the paper 
 the host unfolded it eagerly like a person who is expecting a reply 
 he seemed to read it attentively then tossed his head and remained thoughtful for a moment 
 then he took a step in the direction of the traveller who appeared to be immersed in reflections which were not very serene 
 i cannot receive you sir said he 
 the man half rose 
 what 
 are you afraid that i will not pay you 
 do you want me to pay you in advance 
 i have money i tell you 
 it is not that 
 what then 
 you have money 
 yes said the man 
 and i said the host have no room 
 the man resumed tranquilly put me in the stable 
 i cannot 
 why 
 the horses take up all the space 
 very well retorted the man a corner of the loft then a truss of straw 
 we will see about that after dinner 
 i cannot give you any dinner 
 this declaration made in a measured but firm tone struck the stranger as grave 
 he rose 
 ah bah 
 but i am dying of hunger 
 i have been walking since sunrise i have travelled twelve leagues 
 i pay 
 i wish to eat 
 i have nothing said the landlord 
 the man burst out laughing and turned towards the fireplace and the stoves 
 nothing and all that 
 all that is engaged 
 by whom 
 by messieurs the wagoners 
 how many are there of them 
 twelve 
 there is enough food there for twenty 
 they have engaged the whole of it and paid for it in advance 
 the man seated himself again and said without raising his voice i am at an inn i am hungry and i shall remain 
 then the host bent down to his ear and said in a tone which made him start go away 
 at that moment the traveller was bending forward and thrusting some brands into the fire with the tip of his staff he turned quickly round and as he opened his mouth to reply the host gazed steadily at him and added still in a low voice stop enough of that sort of talk 
 do you want me to tell you your name 
 your name is jean valjean 
 now do you want me to tell you who you are 
 when i saw you come in i suspected something i sent to the and this was the reply that was sent to me can you read 
 so saying he held out to the stranger fully unfolded the paper which had just travelled from the inn to the and from the to the inn 
 the man cast a glance upon it the landlord resumed after a pause 
 i am in the habit of being polite to every one 
 go away 
 the man dropped his head picked up the knapsack which he had deposited on the ground and took his departure 
 he chose the principal street 
 he walked straight on at a venture keeping close to the houses like a sad and humiliated man he did not turn round a single time 
 had he done so he would have seen the host of the cross of colbas standing on his threshold surrounded by all the guests of his inn and all the in the street talking vivaciously and pointing him out with his finger and from the glances of terror and distrust cast by the group he might have divined that his arrival would speedily become an event for the whole town 
 he saw nothing of all this 
 people who are crushed do not look behind them 
 they know but too well the evil fate which follows them 
 thus he proceeded for some time walking on without ceasing traversing at random streets of which he knew nothing forgetful of his fatigue as is often the case when a man is sad 
 all at once he felt the pangs of hunger sharply 
 night was drawing near he glanced about him to see whether he could not discover some shelter 
 the fine hostelry was closed to him he was seeking some very humble public house some hovel however lowly 
 just then a light flashed up at the end of the streets a pine branch suspended from a of iron was outlined against the white sky of the twilight 
 he proceeded thither 
 it proved to be in fact a public house 
 the public house which is in the rue de chaffaut 
 the wayfarer halted for a moment and peeped through the window into the interior of the room of the public house illuminated by a small lamp on a table and by a large fire on the hearth 
 some men were engaged in drinking there 
 the landlord was warming himself an iron pot suspended from a crane bubbled over the flame 
 the entrance to this public house which is also a sort of an inn is by two doors 
 one opens on the street the other upon a small yard filled with manure 
 the traveller dare not enter by the street door he slipped into the yard halted again then raised the latch timidly and opened the door 
 who goes there said the master 
 some one who wants supper and bed 
 good 
 we furnish supper and bed here 
 he entered 
 all the men who were drinking turned round the lamp illuminated him on one side the firelight on the other they examined him for some time while he was taking off his knapsack 
 the host said to him there is the fire 
 the supper is cooking in the pot 
 come and warm yourself comrade 
 he approached and seated himself near the hearth 
 he stretched out his feet which were exhausted with fatigue to the fire a fine odor was emitted by the pot 
 all that could be distinguished of his face beneath his cap which was well pulled down assumed a vague appearance of comfort mingled with that other poignant aspect which habitual suffering bestows 
 it was moreover a firm energetic and melancholy profile this physiognomy was strangely composed it began by seeming humble and ended by seeming severe 
 the eye shone beneath its lashes like a fire beneath brushwood 
 one of the men seated at the table however was a fishmonger who before entering the public house of the rue de chaffaut had been to stable his horse at it chanced that he had that very morning encountered this unprepossessing stranger on the road between bras have forgotten the name i think it was escoublon 
 now when he met him the man who then seemed already extremely weary had requested him to take him on his crupper to which the fishmonger had made no reply except by redoubling his gait 
 this fishmonger had been a member half an hour previously of the group which surrounded jacquin labarre and had himself related his disagreeable encounter of the morning to the people at the cross of colbas 
 from where he sat he made an imperceptible sign to the the went to him 
 they exchanged a few words in a low tone 
 the man had again become absorbed in his reflections 
 the returned to the fireplace laid his hand abruptly on the shoulder of the man and said to him 
 you are going to get out of here 
 the stranger turned round and replied gently ah 
 you know 
 yes 
 i was sent away from the other inn 
 and you are to be turned out of this one 
 where would you have me go 
 elsewhere 
 the man took his stick and his knapsack and departed 
 as he went out some children who had followed him from the cross of colbas and who seemed to be lying in wait for him threw stones at him 
 he retraced his steps in anger and threatened them with his stick 
 the children dispersed like a flock of birds 
 he passed before the prison 
 at the door hung an iron chain attached to a bell 
 he rang 
 the wicket opened 
 turnkey said he removing his cap politely will you have the kindness to admit me and give me a lodging for the night 
 a voice replied 
 the prison is not an inn 
 get yourself arrested and you will be admitted 
 the wicket closed again 
 he entered a little street in which there were many gardens some of them are enclosed only by hedges which lends a cheerful aspect to the street 
 in the midst of these gardens and hedges he caught sight of a small house of a single story the window of which was lighted up 
 he peered through the pane as he had done at the public house 
 within was a large whitewashed room with a bed draped in printed cotton stuff and a cradle in one corner a few wooden chairs and a gun hanging on the wall a table was spread in the centre of the room 
 a copper lamp illuminated the tablecloth of coarse white linen the pewter jug shining like silver and filled with wine and the brown smoking at this table sat a man of about forty with a merry and open countenance who was dandling a little child on his knees 
 close by a very young woman was nursing another child the father was laughing the child was laughing the mother was smiling 
 the stranger paused a moment in revery before this tender and calming spectacle 
 what was taking place within him he alone could have told 
 it is probable that he thought that this joyous house would be hospitable and that in a place where he beheld so much happiness he would find perhaps a little pity 
 he tapped on the pane with a very small and feeble knock 
 they did not hear him 
 he tapped again 
 he heard the woman say it seems to me husband that some one is knocking 
 no replied the husband 
 he tapped a third time 
 the husband rose took the lamp and went to the door which he opened 
 he was a man of lofty stature half peasant half artisan he wore a huge leather apron which reached to his left shoulder and which a hammer a red handkerchief a and all sorts of objects which were upheld by the girdle as in a pocket caused to bulge out 
 he carried his head thrown backwards his shirt widely opened and turned back displayed his bull neck white and bare 
 he had thick eyelashes enormous black whiskers prominent eyes the lower part of his face like a snout and besides all this that air of being on his own ground which is indescribable 
 pardon me sir said the wayfarer could you in consideration of payment give me a plate of soup and a corner of that shed yonder in the garden in which to sleep 
 tell me can you for money 
 who are you demanded the master of the house 
 the man replied 
 i have just come from i have walked all day long 
 i have travelled twelve leagues 
 can you if i pay 
 i would not refuse said the peasant to lodge any respectable man who would pay me 
 but why do you not go to the inn 
 there is no room 
 bah 
 impossible 
 this is neither a fair nor a market day have you been to labarre 
 yes 
 well 
 the traveller replied with embarrassment 
 i do not know he did not receive me 
 have you been to in the rue chaffaut 
 the embarrassment increased he stammered he did not receive me either 
 the countenance assumed an expression of distrust he surveyed the newcomer from head to feet and suddenly exclaimed with a sort of shudder 
 are you the man 
 he cast a fresh glance upon the stranger took three steps backwards placed the lamp on the table and took his gun down from the wall 
 meanwhile at the words are you the man the woman had risen had clasped her two children in her arms and had taken refuge precipitately behind her husband staring in terror at the stranger with her bosom uncovered and with frightened eyes as she murmured in a low tone 
 patois of the french alps 
 chat de maraude rascally marauder 
 all this took place in less time than it requires to picture it to self 
 after having scrutinized the man for several moments as one scrutinizes a viper the master of the house returned to the door and said 
 clear out 
 for sake a glass of water said the man 
 a shot from my gun said the peasant 
 then he closed the door violently and the man heard him shoot two large bolts 
 a moment later the was closed and the sound of a bar of iron which was placed against it was audible outside 
 night continued to fall 
 a cold wind from the alps was blowing by the light of the expiring day the stranger perceived in one of the gardens which bordered the street a sort of hut which seemed to him to be built of sods 
 he climbed over the wooden fence resolutely and found himself in the garden 
 he approached the hut its door consisted of a very low and narrow aperture and it resembled those buildings which construct for themselves along the roads 
 he thought without doubt that it was in fact the dwelling of a he was suffering from cold and hunger but this was at least a shelter from the cold this sort of dwelling is not usually occupied at night 
 he threw himself flat on his face and crawled into the hut 
 it was warm there and he found a tolerably good bed of straw 
 he lay for a moment stretched out on this bed without the power to make a movement so fatigued was he 
 then as the knapsack on his back was in his way and as it furnished moreover a pillow ready to his hand he set about unbuckling one of the straps 
 at that moment a ferocious growl became audible 
 he raised his eyes 
 the head of an enormous dog was outlined in the darkness at the entrance of the hut 
 it was a kennel 
 he was himself vigorous and formidable he armed himself with his staff made a shield of his knapsack and made his way out of the kennel in the best way he could not without enlarging the rents in his rags 
 he left the garden in the same manner but backwards being obliged in order to keep the dog respectful to have recourse to that manoeuvre with his stick which masters in that sort of fencing designate as la rose couverte 
 when he had not without difficulty repassed the fence and found himself once more in the street alone without refuge without shelter without a roof over his head chased even from that bed of straw and from that miserable kennel he dropped rather than seated himself on a stone and it appears that a heard him exclaim i am not even a dog 
 he soon rose again and resumed his march 
 he went out of the town hoping to find some tree or haystack in the fields which would afford him shelter 
 he walked thus for some time with his head still drooping when he felt himself far from every human habitation he raised his eyes and gazed searchingly about him 
 he was in a field before him was one of those low hills covered with stubble which after the harvest resemble shaved heads 
 the horizon was perfectly black 
 this was not alone the obscurity of night it was caused by very clouds which seemed to rest upon the hill itself and which were mounting and filling the whole sky 
 meanwhile as the moon was about to rise and as there was still floating in the zenith a remnant of the brightness of twilight these clouds formed at the summit of the sky a sort of whitish arch whence a gleam of light fell upon the earth 
 the earth was thus better lighted than the sky which produces a particularly sinister effect and the hill whose contour was poor and mean was outlined vague and wan against the gloomy horizon the whole effect was hideous petty lugubrious and narrow 
 there was nothing in the field or on the hill except a deformed tree which writhed and shivered a few paces distant from the wayfarer 
 this man was evidently very far from having those delicate habits of intelligence and spirit which render one sensible to the mysterious aspects of things nevertheless there was something in that sky in that hill in that plain in that tree which was so profoundly desolate that after a moment of immobility and revery he turned back abruptly 
 there are instants when nature seems hostile 
 he retraced his steps the gates of d were closed 
 d which had sustained sieges during the wars of religion was still surrounded in by ancient walls flanked by square towers which have been demolished since 
 he passed through a breach and entered the town again 
 it might have been eight in the evening 
 as he was not acquainted with the streets he recommenced his walk at random 
 in this way he came to the prefecture then to the seminary as he passed through the cathedral square he shook his fist at the church 
 at the corner of this square there is a printing establishment it is there that the proclamations of the emperor and of the imperial guard to the army brought from the island of elba and dictated by napoleon himself were printed for the first time 
 worn out with fatigue and no longer entertaining any hope he lay down on a stone bench which stands at the doorway of this printing office 
 at that moment an old woman came out of the church 
 she saw the man stretched out in the shadow 
 what are you doing there my friend said she 
 he answered harshly and angrily 
 as you see my good woman i am sleeping 
 the good woman who was well worthy the name in fact was the marquise de r 
 on this bench she went on 
 i have had a mattress of wood for nineteen years said the man i have a mattress of stone 
 you have been a soldier 
 yes my good woman a soldier 
 why do you not go to the inn 
 because i have no money 
 alas said madame de r i have only four sous in my purse 
 give it to me all the same 
 the man took the four sous 
 madame de r continued 
 you cannot obtain lodgings in an inn for so small a sum 
 but have you tried it is impossible for you to pass the night thus 
 you are cold and hungry no doubt 
 some one might have given you a lodging out of charity 
 i have knocked at all doors 
 well 
 i have been driven away everywhere 
 the good woman touched the arm and pointed out to him on the other side of the street a small low house which stood beside the palace 
 you have knocked at all doors 
 yes 
 have you knocked at that one 
 no 
 knock there

 the empire strikes back 
 ii 
 
 the temperature on the surface of hoth had dropped but despite the frigid imperial probe droid continued its leisurely drift above the fields andhills its extended sensors still reaching in all directions for life signs 
 the heat sensors suddenly reacted it had found a heat source in thevicinity and warmth was a good indication of life the head swiveled on its sensitive eyelike blisters noting the direction from which the heat sourceoriginated automatically the probe robot adjusted its speed and began to move atmaximum velocity over the icy fields 
 the insectlike machine slowed only when it neared a mound of snow bigger thanthe probe droid itself the scanners made note of the meters in height and an enormous six meters long but the was of only secondary importance what was truly astounding if a surveillancemachine could ever be astounded was the amount of heat radiating from beneath themound the creature under that snowy hill must surely be well protected against thecold 
 a thin beam of light shot from one of the probe intense heat boring into the white mound and scattering gleaming snow flecks inall directions 
 the mound began to shiver then to quake whatever existed beneath it wasdeeply irritated by the probing laser beam snow began to fall away from themound in sizable clumps when at one end two eyes showed through the mass ofwhite 
 huge yellow eyes peered like twin points of fire at the mechanical creature thatcontinued to blast away with its painful beams the eyes burned with primevalhatred for the thing that had interrupted its slumber 
 the mound shook again with a roar that nearly destroyed the probe sensors it zoomed back several meters widening the space between it andthe creature the droid had never before encountered a wampa ice creature itscomputers advised that the beast be dealt with expeditiously 
 the droid made an internal adjustment to regulate the potency of its laser than a moment later the beam was at maximum intensity the machine aimedthe laser at the creature enveloping it in a great flaming and smoking later the few remaining particles of the wampa were swept away by the icywinds 
 the smoke disappeared leaving behind no physical for a largedepression in the an ice creature had ever been there 
 but its existence had been properly recorded in the memory of the probe was already continued on its programmed mission 
 the roars of another wampa ice creature finally awakened the battered youngrebel commander head was spinning aching perhaps exploding for all hecould tell with painstaking effort he brought his vision into focus discerning thathe was in an ice gorge its jagged walls reflecting the fading twilight 
 he suddenly realized he was hanging upside down arms dangling and fingertipssome thirty centimeters from the snowy floor his ankles were numb he cranedhis neck and saw that his feet were frozen in ice hanging from the ceiling and that theice was forming on his legs like stalactites he could feel the frozen mask of hisown blood caked on his face where the wampa ice creature had viciously slashedhim 
 again luke heard the bestial moans louder now as they resounded through thedeep and narrow passageway of ice the roars of the monster were deafening hewondered which would kill him first the cold or the fangs and claws of the thing thatinhabited the gorge 
 got to free myself he thought get free of this ice his strength had not yetreturned fully but with a determined effort he pulled himself up and reached for theconfining bonds still too weak luke could not break the ice and fell back into hishanging position the white floor rushing up at him 
 relax he said to himself relax 
 the ice walls creaked with the bellows of the approaching feet crunched on the frigid ground coming frightening nearer it would not belong before the shaggy white horror would be back and possibly warming the coldyoung warrior in the darkness of its belly 
 eyes darted about the gorge finally spotting the pile of gear he hadbrought with him on his mission now lying in a useless crumpled heap on the equipment was nearly a full unattainable meter beyond his grasp and with thatgear was a device that entirely captured his stout handgrip unit with apair of small switches and a surmounting metal disk the object had once belongedto his father a former jedi knight who had been betrayed and murdered by the youngdarth vader but now it was given him by ben kenobi to be wielded withhonor against imperial tyranny 
 in desperation luke tried twisting his aching body just enough to reach thediscarded lightsaber but the freezing cold coursing through his body slowed himdown and weakened him luke was beginning to resign himself to his fate as heheard the snarling wampa ice creature approaching his last feelings of hope werenearly gone when he sensed the presence 
 but it was not the presence of the white giant that dominated this gorge 
 rather it was that soothing spiritual presence which occasionally visited luke inmoments of stress or danger the presence that had first come to him only after oldben once again in his jedi role of kenobi vanished into a crumple of hisown dark robes after being cut down by darth lightsaber the presence thatwas sometimes like a familiar voice an almost silent whisper that spoke directly mind 
 luke the whisper was there again hauntingly think of the lightsaber inyour hand 
 the words made already aching head throb then he felt a suddenresurgence of strength a feeling of confidence that urged him to continue fightingdespite his apparently hopeless situation his eyes fixed upon the lightsaber hishand reached out painfully the freezing in his limbs already taking its toll hesqueezed his eyes shut in concentration but the weapon was still beyond his knew that the lightsaber would require more than just struggling to reach 
 gotta relax luke told himself relax his disembodied guardian let theforce flow luke 
 the force 
 luke saw the inverted gorillalike image of the wampa ice creature looming itsraised arms ending in enormous gleaming claws he could see the apish face for thefirst time now and shivered at the sight of the ramlike horns the quiveringlower jaw with its protruding fangs 
 but then the warrior divorced the creature from his thoughts he stoppedstruggling for his weapon his body relaxed and went limp allowing his spirit to bereceptive to his suggestion already he could feel coursing through himthat energy field generated by all living beings that bound the very universe together 
 as kenobi had taught him the force was within luke to use as he saw fit 
 the wampa ice creature spread its black hooked claws and lumbered towardthe hanging youth suddenly the lightsaber as if by magic sprang to he depressed a colored button on the weapon releasing a beamthat quickly severed his icy bonds 
 as luke weapon in hand dropped to the floor the monstrous figure toweringover him took a cautious step backward the sulfurous eyes blinkedincredulously at the humming lightshaft a sight baffling to its primitive brain 
 though it was difficult to move luke jumped to his feet and waved hislightsaber at the mass of muscle and hair forcing it back a step anotherstep brining the weapon down luke cut through the hide with the bladeof light the wampa ice creature shrieked its hideous roar of agony shaking thegorge walls it turned and hastily lumbered out of the gorge its white bulk blendingwith the distant terrain 
 the sky was already noticeably darker and with the encroaching darkness camethe colder winds the force was with luke but even that mysterious power couldnot warm him now every step he took as he stumbled out of the gorge was moredifficult than the last finally his vision dimming as rapidly as the daylight lukestumbled down an embankment of snow and was unconscious before he even reachedthe bottom 
 in the subsurface main hangar dock chewie was getting the millennium falconready for takeoff he looked up from his work to see a rather curious pair of figuresthat had just appeared from around a nearby corner to mingle with the usual rebelactivity in the hangar 
 neither of these figures was human although one of them had a humanoid shapeand gave the impression of a man in knightly golden armor his movement wereprecise almost too precise to be human as he clanked stiffly through the companion required no manlike legs for locomotion for he was doing quite wellrolling his shorter barrellike body along on miniature wheels 
 the shorter of the two droids was beeping and whistling excitedly 
 not my fault you malfunctioning tin can the tall anthropomorphic droidstated gesturing with a metallic hand i did not ask you to turn on the thermalheater i merely commented that it was freezing in her chamber but supposedto be freezing how are we going to get all her things dried out ah here weare 
 the golden droid in human shape paused to focus his opticalsensors on the docked millennium falcon 
 the other robot retracted his wheels and frontal leg and rested hisstout metal body on the ground the smaller sensors were reading thefamiliar figures of han solo and his wookiee companion as those two continued thework of replacing the central lifters 
 master solo sir threepio called the only one of the robotic twosomeequipped with an imitation human voice might i have a word with you 
 han was not particularly in a mood to be disturbed especially by this fastidiousdroid what is it 
 mistress leia has been trying to reach you on the communicator threepioinformed him it must be malfunctioning 
 but han knew that it was not i shut it off he said sharply as he continued towork on his ship what does her royal holiness want 
 auditory sensors identified the disdain in voice but did notunderstand it the robot mimicked a human gesture as he added she is looking formaster luke and assumed he would be here with you no one seems to know 
 not back yet immediately han became concerned he could seethat the sky beyond the ice cavern entrance had grown considerably darker since heand chewbacca had begun to repair the millennium falcon han knew just howseverely the temperatures dropped on the surface after nightfall and how deadly thewinds could be 
 in a flash he jumped off the lift not even looking back toward thewookiee bolt it down chewie officer of the deck han yelled then broughthis comlink to his mouth and asked security control has commander skywalkerreported in yet a negative reply brought a scowl to face 
 the deck sergeant and his aide hurried up to solo in response to his summons 
 is commander skywalker back yet han asked tension in his voice 
 i seen him the deck sergeant replied possible he came inthrough the south entrance 
 check on it solo snapped though he was not in an official position to givecommands urgent 
 as the deck sergeant and his aide turned and rushed down the corridor artooemitted a concerned whistle that rose inquiringly in pitch 
 i know artoo threepio answered stiffly turning his upper torso andhead in direction sir might i inquire going on 
 anger welled up inside han as he grunted back at the robot go tell yourprecious princess that luke is dead unless he shows up soon 
 artoo began to whistle hysterically at grim prediction and golden partner exclaimed oh no 
 the main tunnel was filled with activity when han solo rushed in he saw apair of rebel troopers employing all their physical strength to restrain a nervoustauntaun that was trying to break free 
 from the opposite end the deck officer rushed into the corridor his eyes dartingaround the chamber until he had spotted han sir he said skywalker come through the south entrance he might haveforgotten to check in 
 not likely han snapped are the speeders ready 
 not yet the deck officer answered adapting them to the cold is provingdifficult maybe by morning 
 han cut him off there any time to waste on machines that could andprobably would break down have to go out on tauntauns take sectorfour 
 the temperature is falling too rapidly 
 you bet it is han growled and out in it 
 the other officer volunteered cover sector twelve have control set screenalpha 
 but han knew there was no time for control to get its surveillance camerasoperating not with luke probably dying somewhere on the desolate plains pushed his way through the assemblage of rebel troops and took the reins of oneof the trained tauntauns leaping onto the back 
 the night storms will start before any of you can reach the first marker thedeck officer warned 
 then see you in hell grunted han tugging the reins of his mount andmaneuvering the animal out of the cave 
 snow was falling heavily as han solo raced his tauntaun through the was near and the winds were howling fiercely piercing his heavy clothes heknew that he would be as useless as an icicle to luke unless he found the youngwarrior soon 
 the tauntaun was already feeling the effects of the temperature drop not evenits layers of insulating fat or the matted gray fur could protect it from the elementsafter nightfall already the beast was wheezing its breathing becoming increasinglylabored 
 han prayed that the drop at least not until he had locatedluke 
 he drove his mount harder forcing it on across the icy plains 
 another figure was moving across the snow its metal body hovering above thefrozen ground 
 the imperial probe droid paused briefly in its sensors twitching 
 then satisfied with its findings the robot gently lowered itself coming to reston the ground like spider legs several probes separated from the metal some of the snow that had settled there 
 something began to take shape around the robot a pulsating glow that graduallycovered the machine as if with a transparent dome quickly this force fieldsolidified repelling the blowing snow that brushed over the hull 
 after a moment the glow faded and the blowing snow soon formed a perfectdome of white completely concealing the droid and its protective force field 
 the tauntaun was racing at maximum speed certainly too fast considering thedistance it had traveled and the unbearable frigid air no longer wheezing it hadbegun moaning pitifully and its legs were becoming more and more unsteady hanfelt sorry about the pain but at present the life was onlysecondary to that of his friend luke 
 it was becoming difficult for han to see through the thickening he searched for some interruption in the eternal plains some distant spotthat might actually be luke but there was nothing to see other than the darkeningexpanses of snow and ice 
 yet there was a sound 
 han drew the reins in bringing the tauntaun to an abrupt halt on the could not be certain but there seemed to be some sound other than the howlingof the winds that whipped past him he strained to look in the direction of thesound 
 then he spurred his tauntaun forcing it to gallop across the field 
 luke could have been a corpse food for the scavengers by the time the light ofdawn returned but somehow he was still alive though barely and struggling to staythat way even with the night storms violently assaulting him luke painfully pulledhimself upright from the snow only to be blasted back down by the freezing he fell he considered the irony of it farm boy from tatooine maturing tobattle the death star now perishing alone in a frozen alien wasteland 
 it took all of remaining strength to drag himself a half meter beforefinally collapsing sinking into the drifts i he said thoughno one could hear his words 
 but someone though still unseen had heard 
 you must the words vibrated in mind luke look at me 
 luke could not ignore that command the power of those softly spoken wordswas too great 
 with a great effort luke lifted his head and saw what he thought was ahallucination in front of him apparently unaffected by the cold and still clad onlyin the shabby robes he had worn in the hot desert of tatooine stood ben kenobi 
 luke wanted to call out to him but he was speechless 
 the apparition spoke with the same gentle authority ben had always used withthe young man you must survive luke 
 the young commander found the strength to move his lips again cold 
 you must go to the dagobah system the spectral figure of ben kenobiinstructed you will learn from yoda the jedi master the one who taught me 
 luke listened then reached to touch the ghostly figure benben hegroaned 
 the figure remained unmoved by efforts to reach it luke it spokeagain our only hope 
 our only hope 
 luke was confused yet before he could gather the strength to ask for anexplanation the figure began to fade and when every trace of the apparition hadpassed from his sight luke thought he saw the approach of a tauntaun with a humanrider on its back the was approaching its gait unsteady the riderwas still too far away too obscured by the storm for identification 
 in desperation the young rebel commander called out ben before againdropping off into unconsciousness 
 the was barely able to stand on its saurian hind legs when han soloreined it to a stop and dismounted 
 han looked with horror at the almost frozen form lying as if deadat his feet 
 come on buddy he appealed to inert figure immediately forgetting hisown nearly frozen body you dead yet give me a signal here 
 han could detect no sign of life and noticed that face nearly coveredwith snow was savagely torn he rubbed at the face being careful not totouch the drying wounds do this luke not your time 
 finally a slight response a low moan barely audible over the winds wasstrong enough to send a warm glow through own shivering body he grinnedwith relief i knew you leave me out here all alone got to getyou out of here 
 knowing that his in the speed of the moved toward the beast carrying the young warrior limply in his arms butbefore he could drape the unconscious form over the back the an agonized roar then fell into a shaggy gray heap on the snow laying hiscompanion down han rushed to the side of the fallen creature the tauntaun madeone final sound not a roar or bellow but only a sickly rasp then the beast wassilent 
 solo gripped the hide his numbed fingers searching for even theslightest indication of life deader than a triton moon he said knowing that lukedid not hear a word we got much time 
 resting motionless form against the belly of the dead hanproceeded to work it might be something of a sacrilege he mused using a favorite weapon like this but right now lightsaber was the mostefficient and precise tool to cut through the thick skin of a tauntaun 
 at first the weapon felt strange in his hand but momentarily he was cutting carcass from hairy head to scaly hind paws han winced at the foul odorthat rose from the steaming incision there were few things he could remember thatstank like a innards without deliberation he tossed the slipperyentrails into the snow 
 when the corpse had been entirely eviscerated han shoved his friendinside the warm skin i know this smell so good luke keep you from freezing sure this tauntaun hesitate if it were theother way around 
 from the body of the another blast of rose out of thedisemboweled cavity whew han almost gagged just as well outcold pal 
 there much time left to do what had to be done freezing handswent to the supply pack strapped to the back and rummaged through items until he located the shelter container 
 before unpacking it he spoke into his comlink echo base do you copy 
 no response 
 this comlink is useless 
 the sky had darkened ominously and the winds blew violently making evenbreathing close to impossible han fought to open the shelter container and stifflybegan to construct the one piece of rebel equipment that might protect them for a short while longer 
 if i get this shelter up fast he grumbled to himself jabba needthose bounty hunters

 book one 
 chapter xvi 
 
 pierre after all had not managed to choose a career for himself in petersburg and had been expelled from there for riotous conduct and sent to moscow the story told about him at count was true pierre had taken part in tying a policeman to a bear he had now been for some days in moscow and was staying as usual at his house though he expected that the story of his escapade would be already known in moscow and that the ladies about his father who were never favorably disposed toward him would have used it to turn the count against him he nevertheless on the day of his arrival went to his part of the house entering the drawing room where the princesses spent most of their time he greeted the ladies two of whom were sitting at embroidery frames while a third read aloud it was the eldest who was reading the one who had met anna mikhaylovna the two younger ones were embroidering both were rosy and pretty and they differed only in that one had a little mole on her lip which made her much prettier pierre was received as if he were a corpse or a leper the eldest princess paused in her reading and silently stared at him with frightened eyes the second assumed precisely the same expression while the youngest the one with the mole who was of a cheerful and lively disposition bent over her frame to hide a smile probably evoked by the amusing scene she foresaw she drew her wool down through the canvas and scarcely able to refrain from laughing stooped as if trying to make out the pattern 
 how do you do cousin said pierre you recognize me 
 i recognize you only too well too well 
 how is the count can i see him asked pierre awkwardly as usual but unabashed 
 the count is suffering physically and mentally and apparently you have done your best to increase his mental sufferings 
 can i see the count pierre again asked 
 hm if you wish to kill him to kill him outright you can see him olga go and see whether beef tea is ready it is almost time she added giving pierre to understand that they were busy and busy making his father comfortable while evidently he pierre was only busy causing him annoyance 
 olga went out pierre stood looking at the sisters then he bowed and said then i will go to my rooms you will let me know when i can see him 
 and he left the room followed by the low but ringing laughter of the sister with the mole 
 next day prince vasili had arrived and settled in the house he sent for pierre and said to him my dear fellow if you are going to behave here as you did in petersburg you will end very badly that is all i have to say to you the count is very very ill and you must not see him at all 
 since then pierre had not been disturbed and had spent the whole time in his rooms upstairs 
 when boris appeared at his door pierre was pacing up and down his room stopping occasionally at a corner to make menacing gestures at the wall as if running a sword through an invisible foe and glaring savagely over his spectacles and then again resuming his walk muttering indistinct words shrugging his shoulders and gesticulating 
 england is done for said he scowling and pointing his finger at someone unseen mr pitt as a traitor to the nation and to the rights of man is sentenced to but before pierre who at that moment imagined himself to be napoleon in person and to have just effected the dangerous crossing of the straits of dover and captured london could pronounce sentence he saw a and handsome young officer entering his room pierre paused he had left moscow when boris was a boy of fourteen and had quite forgotten him but in his usual impulsive and hearty way he took boris by the hand with a friendly smile 
 do you remember me asked boris quietly with a pleasant smile i have come with my mother to see the count but it seems he is not well 
 yes it seems he is ill people are always disturbing him answered pierre trying to remember who this young man was 
 boris felt that pierre did not recognize him but did not consider it necessary to introduce himself and without experiencing the least embarrassment looked pierre straight in the face 
 count rostov asks you to come to dinner today said he after a considerable pause which made pierre feel uncomfortable 
 ah count rostov exclaimed pierre joyfully then you are his son ilya only fancy i know you at first do you remember how we went to the sparrow hills with madame jacquot such an age 
 you are mistaken said boris deliberately with a bold and slightly sarcastic smile i am boris son of princess anna mikhaylovna drubetskaya rostov the father is ilya and his son is nicholas i never knew any madame jacquot 
 pierre shook his head and arms as if attacked by mosquitoes or bees 
 oh dear what am i thinking about mixed everything up one has so many relatives in moscow so you are boris of course well now we know where we are and what do you think of the boulogne expedition the english will come off badly you know if napoleon gets across the channel i think the expedition is quite feasible if only villeneuve make a mess of things 
 boris knew nothing about the boulogne expedition he did not read the papers and it was the first time he had heard name 
 we here in moscow are more occupied with dinner parties and scandal than with politics said he in his quiet ironical tone i know nothing about it and have not thought about it moscow is chiefly busy with gossip he continued just now they are talking about you and your father 
 pierre smiled in his way as if afraid for his sake that the latter might say something he would afterwards regret but boris spoke distinctly clearly and dryly looking straight into eyes 
 moscow has nothing else to do but gossip boris went on everybody is wondering to whom the count will leave his fortune though he may perhaps outlive us all as i sincerely hope he will 
 yes it is all very horrid interrupted pierre very horrid 
 pierre was still afraid that this officer might inadvertently say something disconcerting to himself 
 and it must seem to you said boris flushing slightly but not changing his tone or attitude it must seem to you that everyone is trying to get something out of the rich man 
 so it does thought pierre 
 but i just wish to say to avoid misunderstandings that you are quite mistaken if you reckon me or my mother among such people we are very poor but for my own part at any rate for the very reason that your father is rich i regard myself as a relation of his and neither i nor my mother would ever ask or take anything from him 
 for a long time pierre could not understand but when he did he jumped up from the sofa seized boris under the elbow in his quick clumsy way and blushing far more than boris began to speak with a feeling of mingled shame and vexation 
 well this is strange do you suppose i who could think i know very well 
 but boris again interrupted him 
 i am glad i have spoken out fully perhaps you did not like it you must excuse me said he putting pierre at ease instead of being put at ease by him but i hope i have not offended you i always make it a rule to speak out well what answer am i to take will you come to dinner at the rostovs 
 and boris having apparently relieved himself of an onerous duty and extricated himself from an awkward situation and placed another in it became quite pleasant again 
 no but i say said pierre calming down you are a wonderful fellow what you have just said is good very good of course you know me we have not met for such a long time not since we were children you might think that i i understand quite understand i could not have done it myself i should not have had the courage but splendid i am very glad to have made your acquaintance queer he added after a pause that you should have suspected me he began to laugh well what of it i hope get better acquainted and he pressed boris hand do you know i have not once been in to see the count he has not sent for me i am sorry for him as a man but what can one do 
 and so you think napoleon will manage to get an army across asked boris with a smile 
 pierre saw that boris wished to change the subject and being of the same mind he began explaining the advantages and disadvantages of the boulogne expedition 
 a footman came in to summon boris the princess was going pierre in order to make boris better acquaintance promised to come to dinner and warmly pressing his hand looked affectionately over his spectacles into boris eyes after he had gone pierre continued pacing up and down the room for a long time no longer piercing an imaginary foe with his imaginary sword but smiling at the remembrance of that pleasant intelligent and resolute young man 
 as often happens in early youth especially to one who leads a lonely life he felt an unaccountable tenderness for this young man and made up his mind that they would be friends 
 prince vasili saw the princess off she held a handkerchief to her eyes and her face was tearful 
 it is dreadful dreadful she was saying but cost me what it may i shall do my duty i will come and spend the night he must not be left like this every moment is precious i think why his nieces put it off perhaps god will help me to find a way to prepare him adieu prince may god support you 
 adieu ma bonne answered prince vasili turning away from her 
 oh he is in a dreadful state said the mother to her son when they were in the carriage he hardly recognizes anybody 
 i understand mamma what is his attitude to pierre asked the son 
 the will will show that my dear our fate also depends on it 
 but why do you expect that he will leave us anything 
 ah my dear he is so rich and we are so poor 
 well that is hardly a sufficient reason mamma 
 oh heaven how ill he is exclaimed the mother

 chapter 
 
 about twelve that night was born the catherine you saw at wuthering heights a puny seven months child and two hours after the mother died having never recovered sufficient consciousness to miss heathcliff or know edgar the distraction at his bereavement is a subject too painful to be dwelt on its after effects showed how deep the sorrow sunk a great addition in my eyes was his being left without an heir i bemoaned that as i gazed on the feeble orphan and i mentally abused old linton for what was only natural partiality the securing his estate to his own daughter instead of his an unwelcomed infant it was poor thing it might have wailed out of life and nobody cared a morsel during those first hours of existence we redeemed the neglect afterwards but its beginning was as friendless as its end is likely to be 
 next and cheerful out of softened in through the blinds of the silent room and suffused the couch and its occupant with a mellow tender glow edgar linton had his head laid on the pillow and his eyes shut his young and fair features were almost as deathlike as those of the form beside him and almost as fixed but his was the hush of exhausted anguish and hers of perfect peace her brow smooth her lids closed her lips wearing the expression of a smile no angel in heaven could be more beautiful than she appeared and i partook of the infinite calm in which she lay my mind was never in a holier frame than while i gazed on that untroubled image of divine rest i instinctively echoed the words she had uttered a few hours before incomparably beyond and above us all whether still on earth or now in heaven her spirit is at home with god 
 i know if it be a peculiarity in me but i am seldom otherwise than happy while watching in the chamber of death should no frenzied or despairing mourner share the duty with me i see a repose that neither earth nor hell can break and i feel an assurance of the endless and shadowless eternity they have life is boundless in its duration and love in its sympathy and joy in its fulness i noticed on that occasion how much selfishness there is even in a love like mr when he so regretted blessed release to be sure one might have doubted after the wayward and impatient existence she had led whether she merited a haven of peace at last one might doubt in seasons of cold reflection but not then in the presence of her corpse it asserted its own tranquillity which seemed a pledge of equal quiet to its former inhabitant 
 do you believe such people are happy in the other world sir give a great deal to know 
 i declined answering mrs question which struck me as something heterodox she proceeded 
 retracing the course of catherine linton i fear we have no right to think she is but leave her with her maker 
 the master looked asleep and i ventured soon after sunrise to quit the room and steal out to the pure refreshing air the servants thought me gone to shake off the drowsiness of my protracted watch in reality my chief motive was seeing mr heathcliff if he had remained among the larches all night he would have heard nothing of the stir at the grange unless perhaps he might catch the gallop of the messenger going to gimmerton if he had come nearer he would probably be aware from the lights flitting to and fro and the opening and shutting of the outer doors that all was not right within i wished yet feared to find him i felt the terrible news must be told and i longed to get it over but how to do it i did not know he was least a few yards farther in the park leant against an old ash tree his hat off and his hair soaked with the dew that had gathered on the budded branches and fell pattering round him he had been standing a long time in that position for i saw a pair of ousels passing and repassing scarcely three feet from him busy in building their nest and regarding his proximity no more than that of a piece of timber they flew off at my approach and he raised his eyes and spoke 
 dead he said not waited for you to learn that put your handkerchief snivel before me damn you all she wants none of your tears 
 i was weeping as much for him as her we do sometimes pity creatures that have none of the feeling either for themselves or others and when i first looked into his face i perceived that he had got intelligence of the catastrophe and a foolish notion struck me that his heart was quelled and he prayed because his lips moved and his gaze was bent on the ground 
 yes dead i answered checking my sobs and drying my cheeks gone to heaven i hope where we may everyone join her if we take due warning and leave our evil ways to follow good 
 did she take due asked heathcliff attempting a sneer did she die like a saint come give me a true history of the event how did 
 he endeavoured to pronounce the name but could not manage it and compressing his mouth he held a silent combat with his inward agony defying meanwhile my sympathy with an unflinching ferocious stare how did she die he resumed at notwithstanding his hardihood to have a support behind him for after the struggle he trembled in spite of himself to his very 
 poor wretch i thought you have a heart and nerves the same as your brother men why should you be anxious to conceal them your pride cannot blind god you tempt him to wring them till he forces a cry of humiliation 
 quietly as a lamb i answered aloud she drew a sigh and stretched herself like a child reviving and sinking again to sleep and five minutes after i felt one little pulse at her heart and nothing more 
 she ever mention me he asked hesitating as if he dreaded the answer to his question would introduce details that he could not bear to hear 
 her senses never returned she recognized nobody from the time you left her i said she lies with a sweet smile on her face and her latest ideas wandered back to pleasant early days her life closed in a gentle she wake as kindly in the other world 
 may she wake in torment he cried with frightful vehemence stamping his foot and groaning in a sudden paroxysm of ungovernable passion why a liar to the end where is she not in oh you said you cared nothing for my sufferings and i pray one repeat it till my tongue earnshaw may you not rest as long as i am living you said i killed me then the murdered do haunt their murderers i believe i know that ghosts have wandered on earth be with me any me mad only do not leave me in this abyss where i cannot find you oh god it is unutterable i cannot live without my life i cannot live without my soul 
 he dashed his head against the knotted trunk and lifting up his eyes howled not like a man but like a savage beast getting goaded to death with knives and spears i observed several splashes of blood about the bark of the tree and his hand and forehead were both stained probably the scene i witnessed was a repetition of others acted during the night it hardly moved my appalled me still i felt reluctant to quit him so but the moment he recollected himself enough to notice me watching he thundered a command for me to go and i obeyed he was beyond my skill to quiet or console 
 mrs funeral was appointed to take place on the friday following her decease and till then her coffin remained uncovered and strewn with flowers and scented leaves in the great linton spent his days and nights there a sleepless guardian circumstance concealed from all but spent his nights at least outside equally a stranger to repose i held no communication with him still i was conscious of his design to enter if he could and on the tuesday a little after dark when my master from sheer fatigue had been compelled to retire a couple of hours i went and opened one of the windows moved by his perseverance to give him a chance of bestowing on the faded image of his idol one final adieu he did not omit to avail himself of the opportunity cautiously and briefly too cautiously to betray his presence by the slightest noise indeed i have discovered that he had been there except for the disarrangement of the drapery about the face and for observing on the floor a curl of light hair fastened with a silver thread which on examination i ascertained to have been taken from a locket hung round neck heathcliff had opened the trinket and cast out its contents replacing them by a black lock of his own i twisted the two and enclosed them together 
 mr earnshaw was of course invited to attend the remains of his sister to the grave and he sent no excuse but he never came so that besides her husband the mourners were wholly composed of tenants and servants isabella was not asked 
 the place of interment to the surprise of the villagers was neither in the chapel under the carved monument of the lintons nor yet by the tombs of her own relations outside it was dug on a green slope in a corner of the kirkyard where the wall is so low that heath and bilberry plants have climbed over it from the moor and peat mould almost buries it her husband lies in the same spot now and they have each a simple headstone above and a plain grey block at their feet to mark the graves

 chapter sixteen 
 
 in the cold gray dawn the sisters lit their lamp and read their chapter with an earnestness never felt before for now the shadow of a real trouble had come the little books were full of help and comfort and as they dressed they agreed to say goodbye cheerfully and hopefully and send their mother on her anxious journey unsaddened by tears or complaints from them everything seemed very strange when they went down so dim and still outside so full of light and bustle within breakfast at that early hour seemed odd and even familiar face looked unnatural as she flew about her kitchen with her nightcap on the big trunk stood ready in the hall cloak and bonnet lay on the sofa and mother herself sat trying to eat but looking so pale and worn with sleeplessness and anxiety that the girls found it very hard to keep their resolution eyes kept filling in spite of herself jo was obliged to hide her face in the kitchen rollermore than once ant the little girls wore a grave troubled expression as if sorrow was a new experience to them 
 nobody talked much but as the time drew very near and they sat waiting for the carriage mrs march said to the girls who were all busied about her one folding her shawl another smoothing out the strings of her bonnet a third putting on her overshoes and a forth fastening up her travelling bag 
 children i leave you to care and mr protection hannah is faithfulness itself and our good neighbor will guard you as if you were his own i have no fears for you yet i am anxious that you should take this trouble rightly grieve and fret when i am gone or think that you can be idle and comfort yourselves by being idle and trying to forget go on with your work as usual for work is a blessed solace hope and keep busy and whatever happens remember that you never can be fatherless 
 yes mother 
 meg dear be prudent watch over your sisters consult hannah and in any perplexity go to mr laurence be patient jo get despondent or do rash things write to me often and be my brave girl ready to help and cheer all beth comfort yourself with your music and be faithful to the little home duties and you amy help all you can be obedient and keep happy safe at home 
 we will mother we will 
 the rattle of an approaching carriage made them all start and listen that was the hard minute but the girls stood it well no one cried no one ran away or uttered a lamentation though their hearts were very heavy as they sent loving messages to father remembering as they spoke that it might be too late to deliver them they kissed their mother quietly clung about her tenderly and tried to wave their hands cheerfully when she drove away 
 laurie and his grandfather came over to see her off and mr brooke looked so strong and sensible and kind that the girls christened him mr greatheart on the spot 
 goodby my darlings god bless and keep us all whispered mrs march as she kissed one dear little face after the other and hurried into the carriage 
 as she rolled away the sun came out and looking back she saw it shining on the group at the gate like a good omen they saw it also and smiled and waved their hands and the last thing she beheld as she turned the corner was the four bright faces and behind them like a bodyguard old mr laurence faithful hannah and devoted laurie 
 how kind everyone is to us she said turning to find fresh proof of it in the respectful sympathy of the young face 
 i see how they can help it returned mr brooke laughing so infectiously that mrs march could not help smiling and so the journey began with the good omens of sunshine smiles and cheerful words 
 i feel as if there had been an earthquake said jo as their neighbors went home to breakfast leaving them to rest and refresh themselves 
 it seems as if half the house was gone added meg forlornly 
 beth opened her lips to say something but could only point to the pile of nicely mended hose which lay on table showing that even in her last hurried moments she had thought and worked for them it was a little thing but it went straight to their hearts and in spite of their brave resolutions they all broke down and cried bitterly 
 hannah wisely allowed them to relieve their feelings and when the shower showed signs of clearing up she came to the rescue armed with a coffeepot 
 now ny dear young ladies remember what your ma said and fret come and have a cup of coffee all round and then fall to work and be a credit to the family 
 coffee was a treat and hannah showed great tact in making it that morning no one could resist her persuasive nods or the fragrant invitation issuing from the nose of the coffee pot they drew up to the table exchanged their handkerchiefs for napkins and in ten minutes were all right again 
 hope and keep busy the motto for us so see who will remember it best i shall go to aunt march as usual oh she lecture though said jo as she sipped with returning spirit 
 i shall go to my kings though much rather stay at home and attend to things here said meg wishing she made her eyes so red 
 no need of that beth and i can keep house perfectly well 
 put in amy with an important air 
 hannah will tell us what to do and have everything nice when you come home added beth getting out her mop and dish tub without delay 
 i think anxiety is very interesting observed amy eating sugar pensively 
 the girls help laughing and felt better for it though meg shook her head at the young lady who could find consolation in a sugar bowl 
 the sight of the turnovers made jo sober again and when the two went out to their daily tasks they looked sorrowfully back at the window where they were accustomed to see their face it was gone but beth had remembered the little household ceremony and there she was nodding away at them like a rosyfaced mandarin 
 so like my beth said jo waving her hat with a grateful face goodbye meggy i hope the kings strain today fret about father dear she added as they parted 
 and i hope aunt march croak your hair is becoming and it looks very boyish and nice returned meg trying not to smile at the curly head which looked comically small on her tall shoulders 
 my only comfort and touching her hat a la laurie away went jo feeling like a shorn sheep on a wintry day 
 news from their father comforted the girls very much for though dangerously ill the presence of the best and tenderest of nurses had already done him good mr brooke sent a bulletin every day and as the head of the family meg insisted on reading the dispatches which grew more cheerful as the week passed at first everyone was eager to write and plump envelopes were carefully 
 poked into the letter box by one or other of the sisters who felt rather important with their washington correspondence as one of these packets contained characteristic notes from the party we will rob an imaginary mail and read them 
 
 my dearest mother 
 it is impossible to tell you how happy your last letter made us for the news was so good we help laughing and crying over it how very kind mr brooke is and how fortunate that mr business detains him near you so long since he is so useful to you and father the girls are all as good as gold jo helps me with the sewing and insists on doing all sorts of hard jobs i should be afraid she might overdo if i know her moral fit last long beth is as regular about her tasks as a clock and never forgets what you told her she grieves about father and looks sober except when she is at her little piano amy minds me nicely and i take great care of her she does her ownhair and i am teaching her to make buttonholes and mend her stockings 
 she tries very hard and i know you will be pleased with her improvement when you come mr laurence watches over us like a motherly old hen as jo says and laurie is very kind and neighborly he and jo keep us merry for we get pretty blue sometimes and feel like orphans with you so far away hannah is a perfect saint she does not scold at all and always calls me miss margaret which is quite proper you know and treats me with respect we are all well and busy but we long day and night to have you back give my dearest love to father and believe me ever your own 
 
 meg 
 
 this note prettily written on scented paper was a great contrast to the next which was scribbled on a big sheet of thin foreign paper ornamented with blots and all manner of flourishes and letters 
 
 my precious marmee 
 three cheers for dear father brooke was a trump to telegraph right off and let us know the minute he was better i rushed up garret when the letter came and tried to thank god for being so good to us but i could only cry and say glad glad that do as well as a regular prayer for i felt a great many in my heart we have such funny times and now i can enjoy them for everyone is so desperately good like living in a nest of turtledoves laugh to see meg head the table and try to be motherish she gets prettier every day and in love with her sometimes the children are regular archangels and i well jo and never shall be anything else oh i must tell you that i came near having a quarrel with laurie i freed my mind about a silly little thing and he was offended i was right but speak as i ought and he marched home saying he come again till i begged pardon i declared i and got mad 
 it lasted all day i felt bad and wanted you very much laurie and i are both so proud hard to beg pardon but i thought come to it for i was in the right he come and just at night i remembered what you said when amy fell into the river i read my little book felt better resolved not to let the sun set on my anger and ran over to tell laurie i was sorry i met him at the gate coming for the same thing we both laughed begged each pardon and felt all good and comfortable again 
 i made a pome yesterday when i was helping hannah wash and as father likes my silly little things i put it in to amuse him give him my lovingest hug that ever was and kiss yourself a dozen times for your 
 
 
 jo 
 a song from the suds 
 queen of my tub i merrily sing 
 while the white foam rises high 
 and sturdily wash and rinse and wring 
 and fasten the clothes to dry 
 then out in the free fresh air they swing 
 under the sunny sky 
 i wish we could wash from out hearts and souls 
 the stains of the week away 
 and let water and air by their magic make 
 ourselves as pure as they 
 then on the earth there would be indeed 
 a glorious washing day 
 along the path of a useful life 
 will heartsease ever bloom 
 the busy mind has no time to think 
 of sorrow or care or gloom 
 and anxious thoughts may be swept away 
 as we bravely wield a broom 
 i am glad a task to me is given 
 to labor at day by day 
 for it brings me health and strength and hope 
 and i cheerfully learn to say 
 head you may think heart you may feel 
 but hand you shall work alway 
 
 dear mother 
 there is only room for me to send my love and some pressed pansies from the root i have been keeping safe in the house for father to see i read every morning try to be good all day and sing myself to sleep with tune i sing land of the leal now it makes me cry everyone is very kind and we are as happy as we can be without you amy wants the rest of the page so i must stop i forget to cover the holders and i wind the clock and air the rooms every day

lionfish nov chapter fifteen aragogcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 summer was creeping over the grounds around the castle sky and lake alike turned periwinkle blue and flowers large as cabbages burst into bloom in the greenhouses but with no hagrid visible from the castle windows striding the grounds with fang at his heels the scene look right to harry no better in fact than the inside of the castle where things were so horribly wrong 
 
 harry and ron had tried to visit hermione but visitors were now barred from the hospital wing 
 
 taking no more chances madam pomfrey told them severely through a crack in the infirmary door no sorry every chance the attacker might come back to finish these people off 
 
 with dumbledore gone fear had spread as never before so that the sun warming the castle walls outside seemed to stop at the mullioned windows there was barely a face to be seen in the school that look worried and tense and any laughter that rang through the corridors sounded shrill and unnatural and was quickly stifled 
 
 harry constantly repeated final words to himself i will only truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me help will always be given at hogwarts to those who ask for it but what good were these words who exactly were they supposed to ask for help when everyone was just as confused and scared as they were 
 
 hint about the spiders was far easier to understand the trouble was there seem to be a single spider left in the castle to follow harry looked everywhere he went helped rather reluctantly by ron they were hampered of course by the fact that they allowed to wander off on their own but had to move around the castle in a pack with the other gryffindors most of their fellow students seemed glad that they were being shepherded from class to class by teachers but harry found it very irksome 
 
 one person however seemed to be thoroughly enjoying the atmosphere of terror and suspicion draco malfoy was strutting around the school as though he had just been appointed head boy harry realize what he was so pleased about until the potions lesson about two weeks after dumbledore and hagrid had left when sitting right behind malfoy harry overheard him gloating to crabbe and goyle 
 
 i always thought father might be the one who got rid of dumbledore he said not troubling to keep his voice down i told you he thinks the worst headmaster the ever had maybe get a decent headmaster now someone who want the chamber of secrets closed mcgonagall last long only filling in 
 
 snape swept past harry making no comment about empty seat and cauldron 
 
 sir said malfoy loudly sir why you apply for the job 
 
 now now malfoy said snape though he suppress a smile professor dumbledore has only been suspended by the governors i daresay be back with us soon enough 
 
 yeah right said malfoy smirking i expect have vote sir if you wanted to apply for the job tell father the best teacher here sir 
 
 snape smirked as he swept off around the dungeon fortunately not spotting seamus finnigan who was pretending to vomit into his cauldron 
 
 quite surprised the mudbloods all packed their bags by now malfoy went on bet you five galleons the next one dies pity it granger 
 
 the bell rang at that moment which was lucky at last words ron had leapt off his stool and in the scramble to collect bags and books his attempts to reach malfoy went unnoticed 
 
 let me at him ron growled as harry and dean hung onto his arms i care i need my wand going to kill him with my bare hands 
 
 hurry up got to take you all to herbology barked snape over the heads and off they marched with harry ron and dean bringing up the rear ron still trying to get loose it was only safe to let go of him when snape had seen them out of the castle and they were making their way across the vegetable patch toward the greenhouses 
 
 the herbology class was very subdued there were now two missing from their number justin and hermione 
 
 professor sprout set them all to work pruning the abyssinian shrivelfigs harry went to tip an armful of withered stalks onto the compost heap and found himself with ernie macmillan ernie took a deep breath and said very formally i just want to say harry that sorry i ever suspected you i know never attack hermione granger and i apologize for all the stuff i said all in the same boat now and well 
 
 he held out a pudgy hand and harry shook it 
 
 ernie and his friend hannah came to work at the same shrivelfig as harry and ron 
 
 that draco malfoy character said ernie breaking off dead twigs he seems very pleased about all this he know i think he might be heir 
 
 clever of you said ron who seem to have forgiven ernie as readily as harry 
 
 do you think malfoy harry ernie asked 
 
 no said harry so firmly that ernie and hannah stared 
 
 a second later harry spotted something 
 
 several large spiders were scuttling over the ground on the other side of the glass moving in an unnaturally straight line as though taking the shortest route to a prearranged meeting harry hit ron over the hand with his pruning shears 
 
 ouch you 
 
 harry pointed out the spiders following their progress with his eyes screwed up against the sun 
 
 oh yeah said ron trying and failing to look pleased but we follow them now 
 
 ernie and hannah were listening curiously 
 
 eyes narrowed as he focused on the spiders if they pursued their fixed course there could be no doubt about where they would end up 
 
 looks like heading for the forbidden forest 
 
 and ron looked even unhappier about that 
 
 at the end of the lesson professor sprout escorted the class to their defense against the dark arts lesson harry and ron lagged behind the others so they could talk out of earshot 
 
 have to use the invisibility cloak again harry told ron we can take fang with us used to going into the forest with hagrid he might be some help 
 
 right said ron who was twirling his wand nervously in his fingers er there there supposed to be werewolves in the forest he added as they took their usual places at the back of classroom 
 
 preferring not to answer that question harry said there are good things in there too the centaurs are all right and the unicorns 
 
 ron had never been into the forbidden forest before harry had entered it only once and had hoped never to do so again 
 
 lockhart bounded into the room and the class stared at him every other teacher in the place was looking grimmer than usual but lockhart appeared nothing short of buoyant 
 
 come now he cried beaming around him why all these long faces 
 
 people swapped exasperated looks but nobody answered 
 
 you people realize said lockhart speaking slowly as though they were all a bit dim the danger has passed the culprit has been taken away 
 
 says who said dean thomas loudly 
 
 my dear young man the minister of magic have taken hagrid if he been one hundred percent sure that he was guilty said lockhart in the tone of someone explaining that one and one made two 
 
 oh yes he would said ron even more loudly than dean 
 
 i flatter myself i know a touch more about arrest than you do mr weasley said lockhart in a tone 
 
 ron started to say that he think so somehow but stopped in midsentence when harry kicked him hard under the desk 
 
 we there remember harry muttered 
 
 but disgusting cheeriness his hints that he had always thought hagrid was no good his confidence that the whole business was now at an end irritated harry so much that he yearned to throw gadding with ghouls right in stupid face instead he contented himself with scrawling a note to ron do it tonight 
 
 ron read the message swallowed hard and looked sideways at the empty seat usually filled by hermione the sight seemed to stiffen his resolve and he nodded 
 
 the gryffindor common room was always very crowded these days because from six onward the gryffindors had nowhere else to go they also had plenty to talk about with the result that the common room often empty until past midnight 
 
 harry went to get the invisibility cloak out of his trunk right after dinner and spent the evening sitting on it waiting for the room to clear fred and george challenged harry and ron to a few games of exploding snap and ginny sat watching them very subdued in usual chair harry and ron kept losing on purpose trying to finish the games quickly but even so it was well past midnight when fred george and ginny finally went to bed 
 
 harry and ron waited for the distant sounds of two dormitory doors closing before seizing the cloak throwing it over themselves and climbing through the portrait hole 
 
 it was another difficult journey through the castle dodging all the teachers at last they reached the entrance hall slid back the lock on the oak front doors squeezed between them trying to stop any creaking and stepped out into the moonlit grounds 
 
 course said ron abruptly as they strode across the black grass we might get to the forest and find nothing to follow those spiders might been going there at all i know it looked like they were moving in that sort of general direction but 
 
 his voice trailed away hopefully 
 
 they reached house sad and with its blank windows when harry pushed the door open fang went mad with joy at the sight of them worried he might wake everyone at the castle with his deep booming barks they hastily fed him treacle fudge from a tin on the mantelpiece which glued his teeth together 
 
 harry left the invisibility cloak on table there would be no need for it in the forest 
 
 fang going for a walk said harry patting his leg and fang bounded happily out of the house behind them dashed to the edge of the forest and lifted his leg against a large sycamore tree 
 
 harry took out his wand murmured lumos and a tiny light appeared at the end of it just enough to let them watch the path for signs of spiders 
 
 good thinking said ron light mine too but you know probably blow up or something 
 
 harry tapped ron on the shoulder pointing at the grass two solitary spiders were hurrying away from the wandlight into the shade of the trees 
 
 okay ron sighed as though resigned to the worst ready go 
 
 so with fang scampering around them sniffing tree roots and leaves they entered the forest by the glow of wand they followed the steady trickle of spiders moving along the path they walked behind them for about twenty minutes not speaking listening hard for noises other than breaking twigs and rustling leaves then when the trees had become thicker than ever so that the stars overhead were no longer visible and wand shone alone in the sea of dark they saw their spider guides leaving the path 
 
 harry paused trying to see where the spiders were going but everything outside his little sphere of light was he had never been this deep into the forest before he could vividly remember hagrid advising him not to leave the forest path last time been in here but hagrid was miles away now probably sitting in a cell in azkaban and he had also said to follow the spiders 
 
 something wet touched hand and he jumped backward crushing foot but it was only nose 
 
 what reckon harry said to ron whose eyes he could just make out reflecting the light from his wand 
 
 come this far said ron 
 
 so they followed the darting shadows of the spiders into the trees they move very quickly now there were tree roots and stumps in their way barely visible in the near blackness harry could feel hot breath on his hand more than once they had to stop so that harry could crouch down and find the spiders in the wandlight 
 
 they walked for what seemed like at least half an hour their robes snagging on branches and brambles after a while they noticed that the ground seemed to be sloping downward though the trees were as thick as ever 
 
 then fang suddenly let loose a great echoing bark making both harry and ron jump out of their skins 
 
 what said ron loudly looking around into the and gripping elbow very hard 
 
 something moving over there harry breathed listen sounds like something big 
 
 they listened some distance to their right the something big was snapping branches as it carved a path through the trees 
 
 oh no said ron oh no oh no oh 
 
 shut up said harry frantically hear you 
 
 hear me said ron in an unnaturally high voice already heard fang 
 
 the darkness seemed to be pressing on their eyeballs as they stood terrified waiting there was a strange rumbling noise and then silence 
 
 what think doing said harry 
 
 probably getting ready to pounce said ron 
 
 they waited shivering hardly daring to move 
 
 think gone harry whispered 
 
 dunno 
 
 then to their right came a sudden blaze of light so bright in the darkness that both of them flung up their hands to shield their eyes fang yelped and tried to run but got lodged in a tangle of thorns and yelped even louder 
 
 harry ron shouted his voice breaking with relief harry our car 
 
 what 
 
 come on 
 
 harry blundered after ron toward the light stumbling and tripping and a moment later they had emerged into a clearing 
 
 mr car was standing empty in the middle of a circle of thick trees under a roof of dense branches its headlights ablaze as ron walked toward it it moved slowly toward him exactly like a large turquoise dog greeting its owner 
 
 been here all the time said ron delightedly walking around the car look at it the turned it wild 
 
 the sides of the car were scratched and smeared with mud apparently it had taken to trundling around the forest on its own fang seem at all keen on it he kept close to harry who could feel him quivering his breathing slowing down again harry stuffed his wand back into his robes 
 
 and we thought it was going to attack us said ron leaning against the car and patting it i wondered where it had gone 
 
 harry squinted around on the floodlit ground for signs of more spiders but they had all scuttled away from the glare of the headlights 
 
 lost the trail he said go and find them 
 
 ron speak he move his eyes were fixed on a point some ten feet above the forest floor right behind harry his face was livid with terror 
 
 harry even have time to turn around there was a loud clicking noise and suddenly he felt something long and hairy seize him around the middle and lift him off the ground so that he was hanging facedown struggling terrified he heard more clicking and saw legs leave the ground too heard fang whimpering and howling next moment he was being swept away into the dark trees 
 
 head hanging harry saw that what had hold of him was marching on six immensely long hairy legs the front two clutching him tightly below a pair of shining black pincers behind him he could hear another of the creatures no doubt carrying ron they were moving into the very heart of the forest harry could hear fang fighting to free himself from a third monster whining loudly but harry have yelled even if he had wanted to he seemed to have left his voice back with the car in the clearing 
 
 he never knew how long he was in the clutches he only knew that the darkness suddenly lifted enough for him to see that the ground was now swarming with spiders craning his neck sideways he realized that they had reached the ridge of a vast hollow a hollow that had been cleared of trees so that the stars shone brightly onto the worst scene he had ever laid eyes on 
 
 spiders not tiny spiders like those surging over the leaves below spiders the size of carthorses black hairy gigantic the massive specimen that was carrying harry made its way down the steep slope toward a misty domed web in the very center of the hollow while its fellows closed in all around it clicking their pincers excitedly at the sight of its load 
 
 harry fell to the ground on all fours as the spider released him ron and fang thudded down next to him fang howling anymore but cowering silently on the spot ron looked exactly like harry felt his mouth was stretched wide in a kind of silent scream and his eyes were popping 
 
 harry suddenly realized that the spider that had dropped him was saying something it had been hard to tell because he clicked his pincers with every word he spoke 
 
 aragog it called aragog 
 
 and from the middle of the misty domed web a spider the size of a small elephant emerged very slowly there was gray in the black of his body and legs and each of the eyes on his ugly pincered head was milky white he was blind 
 
 what is it he said clicking his pincers rapidly 
 
 men clicked the spider who had caught harry 
 
 is it hagrid said aragog moving closer his eight milky eyes wandering vaguely 
 
 strangers clicked the spider who had brought ron 
 
 kill them clicked aragog fretfully i was sleeping 
 
 friends of harry shouted his heart seemed to have left his chest to pound in his throat 
 
 click click click went the pincers of the spiders all around the hollow 
 
 aragog paused 
 
 hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before he said slowly 
 
 in trouble said harry breathing very fast why come 
 
 in trouble said the aged spider and harry thought he heard concern beneath the clicking pincers but why has he sent you 
 
 harry thought of getting to his feet but decided against it he think his legs would support him so he spoke from the ground as calmly as he could 
 
 they think up at the school that been setting a a something on students taken him to azkaban 
 
 aragog clicked his pincers furiously and all around the hollow the sound was echoed by the crowd of spiders it was like applause except applause usually make harry feel sick with fear 
 
 but that was years ago said aragog fretfully years and years ago i remember it well why they made him leave the school they believed that i was the monster that dwells in what they call the chamber of secrets they thought that hagrid had opened the chamber and set me free 
 
 and you you come from the chamber of secrets said harry who could feel cold sweat on his forehead 
 
 i said aragog clicking angrily i was not born in the castle i come from a distant land a traveler gave me to hagrid when i was an egg hagrid was only a boy but he cared for me hidden in a cupboard in the castle feeding me on scraps from the table hagrid is my good friend and a good man when i was discovered and blamed for the death of a girl he protected me i have lived here in the forest ever since where hagrid still visits me he even found me a wife mosag and you see how our family has grown all through goodness 
 
 harry summoned what remained of his courage 
 
 so you never never attacked anyone 
 
 never croaked the old spider it would have been my instinct but out of respect for hagrid i never harmed a human the body of the girl who was killed was discovered in a bathroom i never saw any part of the castle but the cupboard in which i grew up our kind like the dark and the quiet 
 
 but then do you know what did kill that girl said harry because whatever it is back and attacking people again 
 
 his words were drowned by a loud outbreak of clicking and the rustling of many long legs shifting angrily large black shapes shifted all around him 
 
 the thing that lives in the castle said aragog is an ancient creature we spiders fear above all others well do i remember how i pleaded with hagrid to let me go when i sensed the beast moving about the school 
 
 what is it said harry urgently 
 
 more loud clicking more rustling the spiders seemed to be closing in 
 
 we do not speak of it said aragog fiercely we do not name it i never even told hagrid the name of that dread creature though he asked me many times 
 
 harry want to press the subject not with the spiders pressing closer on all sides aragog seemed to be tired of talking he was backing slowly into his domed web but his fellow spiders continued to inch slowly toward harry and ron 
 
 just go then harry called desperately to aragog hearing leaves rustling behind him 
 
 go said aragog slowly i think not 
 
 but but 
 
 my sons and daughters do not harm hagrid on my command but i cannot deny them fresh meat when it wanders so willingly into our midst friend of hagrid 
 
 harry spun around feet away towering above him was a solid wall of spiders clicking their many eyes gleaming in their ugly black heads 
 
 even as he reached for his wand harry knew it was no good there were too many of them but as he tried to stand ready to die fighting a loud long note sounded and a blaze of light flamed through the hollow 
 
 mr car was thundering down the slope headlights glaring its horn screeching knocking spiders aside several were thrown onto their backs their endless legs waving in the air the car screeched to a halt in front of harry and ron and the doors flew open 
 
 get fang harry yelled diving into the front seat ron seized the boarhound around the middle and threw him yelping into the back of the car the doors slammed shut ron touch the accelerator but the car need him the engine roared and they were off hitting more spiders they sped up the slope out of the hollow and they were soon crashing through the forest branches whipping the windows as the car wound its way cleverly through the widest gaps following a path it obviously knew 
 
 harry looked sideways at ron his mouth was still open in the silent scream but his eyes popping anymore 
 
 are you okay 
 
 ron stared straight ahead unable to speak 
 
 they smashed their way through the undergrowth fang howling loudly in the back seat and harry saw the side mirror snap off as they squeezed past a large oak after ten noisy rocky minutes the trees thinned and harry could again see patches of sky 
 
 the car stopped so suddenly that they were nearly thrown into the windshield they had reached the edge of the forest fang flung himself at the window in his anxiety to get out and when harry opened the door he shot off through the trees to house tail between his legs harry got out too and after a minute or so ron seemed to regain the feeling in his limbs and followed still and staring harry gave the car a grateful pat as it reversed back into the forest and disappeared from view 
 
 harry went back into cabin to get the invisibility cloak fang was trembling under a blanket in his basket when harry got outside again he found ron being violent sick in the pumpkin patch 
 
 follow the spiders said ron weakly wiping his mouth on his sleeve never forgive hagrid lucky to be alive 
 
 i bet he thought aragog hurt friends of his said harry 
 
 exactly problem said ron thumping the wall of the cabin he always thinks monsters as bad as made out and look where got him a cell in azkaban he was shivering uncontrollably now what was the point of sending us in there what have we found out like to know 
 
 that hagrid never opened the chamber of secrets said harry throwing the cloak over ron and prodding him in the arm to make him walk he was innocent 
 
 ron gave a loud snort evidently hatching aragog in a cupboard his idea of being innocent 
 
 as the castle loomed nearer harry twitched the cloak to make sure their feet were hidden then pushed the creaking front doors ajar they walked carefully back across the entrance hall and up the marble staircase holding their breath as they passed corridors where watchful sentries were walking at last they reached the safety of the gryffindor common room where the fire had burned itself into glowing ash they took off the cloak and climbed the winding stair to their dormitory 
 
 ron fell onto his bed without bothering to get undressed harry however feel very sleepy he sat on the edge of his fourposter thinking hard about everything aragog had said 
 
 the creature that was lurking somewhere in the castle he thought sounded like a sort of monster voldemort even other monsters want to name it but he and ron were no closer to finding out what it was or how it petrified its victims even hagrid had never known what was in the chamber of secrets 
 
 harry swung his legs up onto his bed and leaned back against his pillows watching the moon glinting at him through the tower window 
 
 he see what else they could do they had hit dead ends everywhere riddle had caught the wrong person the heir of slytherin had got off and no one could tell whether it was the same person or a different one who had opened the chamber this time there was nobody else to ask harry lay down still thinking about what aragog had said 
 
 he was becoming drowsy when what seemed like their very last hope occurred to him and he suddenly sat bolt upright 
 
 ron he hissed through the dark ron 
 
 ron woke with a yelp like stared wildly around and saw harry 
 
 ron that girl who died aragog said she was found in a bathroom said harry ignoring snuffling snores from the corner what if she never left the bathroom what if still there 
 
 ron rubbed his eyes frowning through the moonlight and then he understood too 
 
 you think not moaning myrtle 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the chamber of secrets 
 

lionfish nov chapter sixteen professor predictioncontents prev chapter next chapter 
 euphoria at finally winning the quidditch cup lasted at least a week even the weather seemed to be celebrating as june approached the days became cloudless and sultry and all anybody felt like doing was strolling onto the grounds and flopping down on the grass with several pints of iced pumpkin juice perhaps playing a casual game of gobstones or watching the giant squid propel itself dreamily across the surface of the lake 
 
 but they exams were nearly upon them and instead of lazing around outside the students were forced to remain inside the castle trying to bully their brains into concentrating while enticing wafts of summer air drifted in through the windows even fred and george weasley had been spotted working they were about to take their ordinary wizarding levels percy was getting ready to take his nastily exhausting wizarding tests the highest qualification hogwarts offered as percy hoped to enter the ministry of magic he needed top grades he was becoming increasingly edgy and gave very severe punishments to anybody who disturbed the quiet of the common room in the evenings in fact the only person who seemed more anxious than percy was hermione 
 
 harry and ron had given up asking her how she was managing to attend several classes at once but they restrain themselves when they saw the exam schedule she had drawn up for herself the first column read 
 
 monday 
 
 arithmancy 
 
 transfiguration 
 
 lunch 
 
 charms 
 
 ancient runes 
 
 hermione ron said cautiously because she was liable to explode when interrupted these days er are you sure copied down these times right 
 
 what snapped hermione picking up the exam schedule and examining it yes of course i have 
 
 is there any point asking how going to sit for two exams at once said harry 
 
 no said hermione shortly have either of you seen my copy of numerology and gramatica 
 
 oh yeah i borrowed it for a bit of bedtime reading said ron but very quietly hermione started shifting heaps of parchment harry ron and hermione had plenty of opportunity to speak to hagrid 
 
 gettin a bit depressed hagrid told them bending low on the pretense of checking that flobberworm was still alive bin cooped up too long but know day after tomorrow one way or the other 
 
 they had potions that afternoon which was an unqualified disaster try as harry might he get his confusing concoction to thicken and snape standing watch with an air of vindictive pleasure scribbled something that looked suspiciously like a zero onto his notes before moving away 
 
 then came astronomy at midnight up on the tallest tower history of magic on wednesday morning in which harry scribbled everything florean fortescue had ever told him about medieval while wishing he could have had one of sundaes with him in the stifling classroom wednesday afternoon meant herbology in the greenhouses under a sun then back to the common room once more with sunburnt necks thinking longingly of this time next day when it would all be over 
 
 their second to last exam on thursday morning was defense against the dark arts professor lupin had compiled the most unusual exam any of them had ever taken a sort of obstacle course outside in the sun where they had to wade across a deep paddling pool containing a grindylow cross a series of potholes full of red caps squish their way across a patch of marsh while ignoring misleading directions from a hinkypunk then climb into an old trunk and battle with a new boggart 
 
 excellent harry lupin muttered as harry climbed out of the trunk grinning full marks 
 
 flushed with his success harry hung around to watch ron and hermione ron did very well until he reached the hinkypunk which successfully confused him into sinking into the quagmire hermione did everything perfectly until she reached the trunk with the boggart in it after about a minute inside it she burst out again screaming 
 
 hermione said lupin startled the matter 
 
 mcgonagall hermione gasped pointing into the trunk said failed everything 
 
 it took a little while to calm hermione down when at last she had regained a grip on herself she harry and ron went back to the castle ron was still slightly inclined to laugh at boggart but an argument was averted by the sight that met them on the top of the steps 
 
 cornelius fudge sweating slightly in his pinstriped cloak was standing there staring out at the grounds he started at the sight of harry 
 
 hello there harry he said just had an exam i expect nearly finished 
 
 yes said harry hermione and ron not being on speaking terms with the minister of magic hovered awkwardly in the background 
 
 lovely day said fudge casting an eye over the lake 
 
 pitypity 
 
 he sighed deeply and looked down at harry 
 
 here on an unpleasant mission harry the committee for the disposal of dangerous creatures required a witness to the execution of a mad hippogriff as i needed to visit hogwarts to check on the black situation i was asked to step in 
 
 does that mean the already happened ron interrupted stepping forward 
 
 no no scheduled for this afternoon said fudge looking curiously at ron 
 
 then you might not have to witness an execution at all said ron stoutly the hippogriff might get off 
 
 before fudge could answer two wizards came through the castle doors behind him one was so ancient he appeared to be withering before their very eyes the other was tall and strapping with a thin back mustache harry gathered that they were representatives of the committee for the disposal of dangerous creatures because the very old wizard squinted toward cabin and said in a feeble voice dear dear getting too old for it fudge 
 
 the man was fingering something in his belt harry looked and saw that he was running one broad thumb along the blade of a shining axe ron opened his mouth to say something but hermione nudged him hard in the ribs and jerked her head toward the entrance hall 
 
 you stop me said ron angrily as they entered the great hall for lunch did you see them even got the axe ready this justice 
 
 ron your dad works for the ministry you go saying things like that to his boss said hermione but she too looked very upset as long as hagrid keeps his head this time and argues his case properly they possibly execute buckbeak 
 
 but harry could tell hermione really believe what she was saying all around them people were talking excitedly as they ate their lunch happily anticipating the end of the exams that afternoon but harry ron and hermione lost in worry about hagrid and buckbeak join in 
 
 and last exam was divination muggle studies they walked up the marble staircase together hermione left them on the first floor and harry and ron proceeded all the way up to the seventh where many of their class were sitting on the spiral staircase to professor classroom trying to cram in a bit of studying 
 
 seeing us all separately neville informed them as they went to sit down next to him he had his copy of unfogging the future open on his lap at the pages devoted to crystal gazing have either of you ever seen anything in a crystal ball he asked them unhappily 
 
 nope said ron in an offhand voice he kept checking his watch harry knew that he was counting down the time until appeal started 
 
 the line of people outside the classroom shortened very slowly as each person climbed back down the silver ladder the rest of the class hissed what did she ask was it okay 
 
 but they all refused to say 
 
 she says the crystal told her that if i tell you have a horrible accident squeaked neville as he clambered back down the ladder toward harry and ron who had now reached the landing 
 
 convenient snorted ron you know starting to think hermione was right about her he jabbed his thumb toward the trapdoor overhead a right old fraud 
 
 yeah said harry looking at his own watch it was now two wish hurry up 
 
 parvati came back down the ladder glowing with pride 
 
 she says got all the makings of a true seer she informed harry and ron i saw loads of stuffwell good luck 
 
 she hurried off down the spiral staircase toward lavender 
 
 ronald weasley said the familiar misty voice from over their heads ron grimaced at harry and climbed the silver ladder out of sight harry was now the only person left to be tested he settled himself on the floor with his back against the wall listening to a fly buzzing in the sunny window his mind across the grounds with hagrid 
 
 finally after about twenty minutes large feet reappeared on the ladder 
 
 it go harry asked him standing up 
 
 rubbish said ron see a thing so i made some stuff up think she was convinced though 
 
 meet you in the common room harry muttered as professor voice called harry potter 
 
 the tower room was hotter than ever before the curtains were closed the fire was alight and the usual sickly scent made harry cough as he stumbled through the clutter of chairs and table to where professor trelawney sat waiting for him before a large crystal ball 
 
 good day my dear she said softly if you would kindly gaze into the orbtake your time nowthen tell me what you see within it 
 
 harry bent over the crystal ball and stared stared as hard as he could willing it to show him something other than swirling white fog but nothing happened 
 
 well professor trelawney prompted delicately what do you see 
 
 the heat was overpowering and his nostrils were stinging with the perfumed smoke wafting from the fire beside them he thought of what ron had just said and decided to pretend 
 
 er said harry a dark shapeum 
 
 what does it resemble whispered professor trelawney think now 
 
 harry cast his mind around and it landed on buckbeak 
 
 a hippogriff he said firmly 
 
 indeed whispered professor trelawney scribbling keenly on the parchment perched upon her knees my boy you may well be seeing the outcome of poor trouble with the ministry of magic look closerdoes the hippogriff appear tohave its head 
 
 yes said harry firmly 
 
 are you sure professor trelawney urged him are you quite sure dear you see it writhing on the ground perhaps and a shadowy figure raising an axe behind it 
 
 no said harry starting to feel slightly sick 
 
 no blood no weeping hagrid 
 
 no said harry again wanting more than ever to leave the room and the heat it looks fine flying away 
 
 professor trelawney sighed 
 
 well dear i think leave it therea little disappointingbut sure you did your best 
 
 relieved harry got up picked up his bag and turned to go but then a loud harsh voice spoke behind him 
 
 it will happen tonight 
 
 harry wheeled around professor trelawney had gone rigid in her armchair her eyes were unfocused and her mouth sagging 
 
 s sorry said harry 
 
 but professor trelawney seem to hear him her eyes started to roll harry sat there in a panic she looked as though she was about to have some sort of seizure he hesitated thinking of running to the hospital wing and then professor trelawney spoke again in the same harsh voice quite unlike her own 
 
 the dark lord lies alone and friendless abandoned by his followers his servant has been chained these twelve years tonight before midnightthe servant will break free and set out to rejoin his master the dark lord will rise again with his aid greater and more terrible than ever he was tonightbefore midnightthe servantwill set outto rejoinhis master 
 
 professor head fell forward onto her chest she made a grunting sort of noise harry sat there staring at her then quite suddenly professor head snapped up again 
 
 so sorry dear boy she said dreamily the heat of the day you knowi drifted off for a moment 
 
 harry sat there staring at her 
 
 is there anything wrong my dear 
 
 you you just told me that the the dark going to rise againthat his going to go back to him 
 
 professor trelawney looked thoroughly startled 
 
 the dark lord my dear boy hardly something to joke aboutrise again indeed 
 
 but you just said it you said the dark lord 
 
 i think you must have dozed off too dear said professor trelawney i would certainly not presume to predict anything quite as as that 
 
 harry climbed back down the ladder and the spiral staircase wonderinghad he just heard professor trelawney make a real prediction or had that been her idea of an impressive end to the test 
 
 five minutes later he was dashing past the security trolls outside the entrance to gryffindor tower professor words still resounding in his head people were striding past him in the opposite direction laughing and joking heading for the grounds and a bit of freedom by the time he had reached the portrait hole and entered the common room it was almost deserted over in the corner however sat ron and hermione 
 
 professor trelawney harry panted just told me 
 
 but he stopped abruptly at the sight of their faces 
 
 buckbeak lost said ron weakly just sent this 
 
 note was dry this time no tears had splattered it yet his hand seemed to have shaken so much as he wrote that it was hardly legible 
 
 lost appeal going to execute at sunset nothing you can do come down i want you to see it 
 hagrid 
 got to go said harry at once he just sit there on his own waiting for the executioner 
 
 sunset though said ron who was staring out the window ill a glazed sort of way never be allowed specially you harry 
 
 harry sank his head into his hands thinking 
 
 if we only had the invisibility cloak 
 
 where is it said hermione 
 
 harry told her about leaving it in the passageway under the witch 
 
 if snape sees me anywhere near there again in serious trouble he finished 
 
 true said hermione getting to her feet if he sees youhow do you open the hump again 
 
 you you tap it and say dissendium said harry but 
 
 hermione wait for the rest of his sentence she strode across the room pushed open the fat portrait and vanished from sight 
 
 she gone to get it ron said staring after her 
 
 she had hermione returned a quarter of an hour later with the silvery cloak folded carefully under her robes 
 
 hermione i know gotten into you lately said ron astounded first you hit malfoy then you walk out on professor trelawney 
 
 hermione looked rather flattered 
 
 they went down to dinner with everybody else but did not return to gryffindor tower afterward harry had the cloak hidden down the front of his robes he had to keep his arms folded to hide the lump they skulked in an empty chamber off the entrance hall listening until they were sure it was deserted they heard a last pair of people hurrying across the hall and a door slamming hermione poked her head around the door 
 
 okay she whispered no one there cloak on 
 
 walking very close together so that nobody would see them they crossed the hall on tiptoe beneath the cloak then walked down the stone front steps into the grounds the sun was already sinking behind the forbidden forest gilding the top branches of the trees 
 
 they reached cabin and knocked he was a minute in answering and when he did he looked all around for his visitor and trembling 
 
 us harry hissed wearing the invisibility cloak let us in and we can take it off 
 
 yeh come hagrid whispered but he stood back and they stepped inside hagrid shut the door quickly and harry pulled off the cloak 
 
 hagrid was not crying nor did he throw himself upon their necks he looked like a man who did not know where he was or what to do this helplessness was worse to watch than tears 
 
 wan some tea he said his great hands were shaking as he reached for the kettle 
 
 buckbeak hagrid said hermione hesitantly 
 
 i i took him outside said hagrid spilling milk all over the table as he filled up the jug tethered in me pumpkin patch thought he oughta see the trees an an smell fresh air before 
 
 hand trembled so violently that the milk jug slipped from his grasp and shattered all over the floor 
 
 do it hagrid said hermione quickly hurrying over and starting to clean up the mess 
 
 another one in the cupboard hagrid said sitting down and wiping his forehead on his sleeve harry glanced at ron who looked back hopelessly 
 
 there anything anyone can do hagrid harry asked fiercely sitting down next to him dumbledore 
 
 tried said hagrid got no power ter overrule the committee he told em all right but scaredyeh know what lucius likethreatened em i expectan the executioner macnair an old pal o be quick an cleanan be beside him 
 
 hagrid swallowed his eyes were darting all over the cabin as though looking for some shred of hope or comfort 
 
 gonna come down while it while it happens wrote me this mornin said he wants ter ter be with me great man dumbledore 
 
 hermione who had been rummaging in cupboard for another milk jug let out a small quickly stifled sob she straightened up with the new jug in her hands fighting back tears 
 
 stay with you too hagrid she began but hagrid shook his shaggy head 
 
 ter go back up ter the castle i told yeh i don wan yeh watchin an yeh shouldn be down here anywayif fudge an dumbledore catch yeh out without permission harry be in big trouble 
 
 silent tears were now streaming down face but she hid them from hagrid bustling around making tea then as she picked up the milk bottle to pour some into the jug she let out a shriek 
 
 ron i believe it scabbers 
 
 ron gaped at her 
 
 what are you talking about 
 
 hermione carried the milk jug over to the table and turned it upside down with a frantic squeak and much scrambling to get back inside scabbers the rat came sliding out onto the table 
 
 scabbers said ron blankly scabbers what are you doing here 
 
 he grabbed the struggling rat and held him up to the light scabbers looked dreadful he was thinner than ever large tufts of hair had fallen out leaving wide bald patches and he writhed in hands as though desperate to free himself 
 
 okay scabbers said ron no cats nothing here to hurt you 
 
 hagrid suddenly stood up his eyes fixed on the window his normally ruddy face had gone the color of parchment 
 
 comin 
 
 harry ron and hermione whipped around a group of men was walking down the distant castle steps in front was albus dumbledore his silver beard gleaming in the dying sun next to him trotted cornelius fudge behind them came the feeble old committee member and the executioner macnair 
 
 yeh gotta go said hagrid every inch of him was trembling they mustn find yeh herego now 
 
 ron stuffed scabbers into his pocket and hermione picked up the cloak let yeh out the back way said hagrid 
 
 they followed him to the door into his back garden harry felt strangely unreal and even more so when he saw buckbeak a few yards away tethered to a tree behind pumpkin patch buckbeak seemed to know something was happening he turned his sharp head from side to side and pawed the ground nervously 
 
 okay beaky said hagrid softly okay he turned to harry ron and hermione go on he said get goin 
 
 but they move 
 
 hagrid we 
 
 tell them what really happened 
 
 they kill him 
 
 go said hagrid fiercely bad enough without you lot in trouble an all 
 
 they had no choice as hermione threw the cloak over harry and ron they heard voices at the front of the cabin hagrid looked at the place where they had just vanished from sight 
 
 go quick he said hoarsely don listen 
 
 and he strode back into his cabin as someone knocked at the front door 
 
 slowly in a kind of horrified trance harry ron and hermione set off silently around house as they reached the other side the front door closed with a sharp snap 
 
 please hurry hermione whispered i stand it i bear it 
 
 they started up the sloping lawn toward the castle the sun was sinking fast now the sky had turned to a clear gray but to the west there was a glow 
 
 ron stopped dead 
 
 oh please ron hermione began 
 
 scabbers he stay put 
 
 ron was bent over trying to keep scabbers in his pocket but the rat was going berserk squeaking madly twisting and flailing trying to sink his teeth into hand 
 
 scabbers me you idiot ron ron hissed 
 
 they heard a door open behind them and voices 
 
 oh ron please move going to do it hermione breathed 
 
 okay scabbers stay put 
 
 they walked forward harry like hermione was trying not to listen to the rumble of voices behind them ron stopped again 
 
 i hold him scabbers shut up hear us 
 
 the rat was squealing wildly but not loudly enough to cover up the sounds drifting from garden there was a jumble of indistinct male voices a silence and then without warning the unmistakable swish and thud of an axe 
 
 hermione swayed on the spot 
 
 they did it she whispered to harry believe it they did it 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the prisoner of azkaban 
 

lionfish nov chapter sixteen the goblet of firecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 i believe it ron said in a stunned voice as the hogwarts students filed back up the steps behind the party from durmstrang krum harry viktor krum 
 
 for sake ron only a quidditch player said hermione 
 
 only a quidditch player ron said looking at her as though he believe his ears hermione one of the best seekers in the world i had no idea he was still at school 
 
 as they recrossed the entrance hall with the rest of the hogwarts students heading for the great hall harry saw lee jordan jumping up and down on the soles of his feet to get a better look at the back of head several girls were frantically searching their pockets as they walked 
 
 oh i believe it i got a single quill on me 
 
 think sign my hat in lipstick 
 
 really hermione said loftily as they passed the girls now squabbling over the lipstick 
 
 getting his autograph if i can said ron you got a quill have you harry 
 
 nope upstairs in my bag said harry 
 
 they walked over to the gryffindor table and sat down ron took care to sit on the side facing the doorway because krum and his fellow durmstrang students were still gathered around it apparently unsure about where they should sit the students from beauxbatons had chosen seats at the ravenclaw table they were looking around the great hall with glum expressions on their faces three of them were still clutching scarves and shawls around their heads 
 
 not that cold said hermione defensively why they bring cloaks 
 
 over here come and sit over here ron hissed over here hermione budge up make a space 
 
 what 
 
 too late said ron bitterly 
 
 viktor krum and his fellow durmstrang students had settled themselves at the slytherin table harry could see malfoy crabbe and goyle looking very smug about this as he watched malfoy bent forward to speak to krum 
 
 yeah right smarm up to him malfoy said ron scathingly i bet krum can see right through him thoughbet he gets people fawning over him all the reckon going to sleep we could offer him a space in our dormitory harryi mind giving him my bed i could kip on a camp bed 
 
 hermione snorted 
 
 they look a lot happier than the beauxbatons lot said harry the durmstrang students were pulling off their heavy furs and looking up at the starry black ceiling with expressions of interest a couple of them were picking up the golden plates and goblets and examining them apparently impressed 
 
 up at the staff table filch the caretaker was adding chairs he was wearing his moldy old tailcoat in honor of the occasion harry was surprised to see that he added four chairs two on either side of 
 
 but there are only two extra people harry said filch putting out four chairs who else is coming 
 
 eh said ron vaguely he was still staring avidly at krum 
 
 when all the students had entered the hall and settled down at their house tables the staff entered filing up to the top table and taking their seats last in line were professor dumbledore professor karkaroff and madame maxime when their headmistress appeared the pupils from beauxbatons leapt to their feet a few of the hogwarts students laughed the beauxbatons party appeared quite unembarrassed however and did not resume their seats until madame maxime had sat down on side dumbledore remained standing and a silence fell over the great hall 
 
 good evening ladies and gentlemen ghosts and most particularly guests said dumbledore beaming around at the foreign students i have great pleasure in welcoming you all to hogwarts i hope and trust that your stay here will be both comfortable and enjoyable 
 
 one of the beauxbatons girls still clutching a muffler around her head gave what was unmistakably a derisive laugh 
 
 no making you stay hermione whispered bristling at her 
 
 the tournament will be officially opened at the end of the feast said dumbledore i now invite you all to eat drink and make yourselves at home 
 
 he sat down and harry saw karkaroff lean forward at once and engage him in conversation 
 
 the plates in front of them filled with food as usual the in the kitchen seemed to have pulled out all the stops there was a greater variety of dishes in front of them than harry had ever seen including several that were definitely foreign 
 
 that said ron pointing at a large dish of some sort of shellfish stew that stood beside a large pudding 
 
 bouillabaisse said hermione 
 
 bless you said ron 
 
 french said hermione i had it on holiday summer before last very nice 
 
 take your word for it said ron helping himself to black pudding 
 
 the great hall seemed somehow much more crowded than usual even though there were barely twenty additional students there perhaps it was because their differently colored uniforms stood out so clearly against the black of the hogwarts robes now that they had removed their furs the durmstrang students were revealed to be wearing robes of a deep bloodred 
 
 hagrid sidled into the hall through a door behind the staff table twenty minutes after the start of the feast he slid into his seat at the end and waved at harry ron and hermione with a very heavily bandaged hand 
 
 skrewts doing all right hagrid harry called 
 
 thrivin hagrid called back happily 
 
 yeah just bet they are said ron quietly looks like finally found a food they like it fingers 
 
 at that moment a voice said excuse me are you wanting ze bouillabaisse 
 
 it was the girl from beauxbatons who had laughed during speech she had finally removed her muffler a long sheet of hair fell almost to her waist she had large deep blue eyes and very white even teeth 
 
 ron went purple he stared up at her opened his mouth to reply but nothing came out except a faint gurgling noise 
 
 yeah have it said harry pushing the dish toward the girl 
 
 you ave finished wiz it 
 
 yeah ron said breathlessly yeah it was excellent 
 
 the girl picked up the dish and carried it carefully off to the ravenclaw table ron was still goggling at the girl as though he had never seen one before harry started to laugh the sound seemed to jog ron back to his senses 
 
 a veela he said hoarsely to harry 
 
 of course she said hermione tartly i see anyone else gaping at her like an idiot 
 
 but she entirely right about that as the girl crossed the hall many boys heads turned and some of them seemed to have become temporarily speechless just like ron 
 
 telling you not a normal girl said ron leaning sideways so he could keep a clear view of her they make them like that at hogwarts 
 
 they make them okay at hogwarts said harry without thinking cho happened to be sitting only a few places away from the girl with the silvery hair 
 
 when both put your eyes back in said hermione briskly be able to see just arrived 
 
 she was pointing up at the staff table the two remaining empty seats had just been filled ludo bagman was now sitting on professor other side while mr crouch boss was next to madame maxime 
 
 what are they doing here said harry in surprise 
 
 they organized the triwizard tournament they said hermione i suppose they wanted to be here to see it start 
 
 when the second course arrived they noticed a number of unfamiliar desserts too ron examined an odd sort of pale blancmange closely then moved it carefully a few inches to his right so that it would be clearly visible from the ravenclaw table the girl who looked like a veela appeared to have eaten enough however and did not come over to get it 
 
 once the golden plates had been wiped clean dumbledore stood up again a pleasant sort of tension seemed to fill the hall now harry felt a slight thrill of excitement wondering what was coming several seats down from them fred and george were leaning forward staring at dumbledore with great concentration 
 
 the moment has come said dumbledore smiling around at the sea of upturned faces the triwizard tournament is about to start i would like to say a few words of explanation before we bring in the casket 
 
 the what harry muttered 
 
 ron shrugged 
 
 just to clarify the procedure that we will be following this year but first let me introduce for those who do not know them mr bartemius crouch head of the department of international magical cooperation there was a smattering of polite applause and mr ludo bagman head of the department of magical games and sports 
 
 there was a much louder round of applause for bagman than for crouch perhaps because of his fame as a beater or simply because he looked so much more likable he acknowledged it with a jovial wave of his hand bartemius crouch did not smile or wave when his name was announced remembering him in his neat suit at the quidditch world cup harry thought he looked strange in robes his toothbrush mustache and severe parting looked very odd next to long white hair and beard 
 
 mr bagman and mr crouch have worked tirelessly over the last few months on the arrangements for the triwizard tournament dumbledore continued and they will be joining myself professor karkaroff and madame maxime on the panel that will judge the champions efforts 
 
 at the mention of the word champions the attentiveness of the listening students seemed to sharpen perhaps dumbledore had noticed their sudden stillness for he smiled as he said the casket then if you please mr filch 
 
 filch who had been lurking unnoticed in a far corner of the hall now approached dumbledore carrying a great wooden chest encrusted with jewels it looked extremely old a murmur of excited interest rose from the watching students dennis creevey actually stood on his chair to see it properly but being so tiny his head hardly rose above anyone 
 
 the instructions for the tasks the champions will face this year have already been examined by mr crouch and mr bagman said dumbledore as filch placed the chest carefully on the table before him and they have made the necessary arrangements for each challenge there will be three tasks spaced throughout the school year and they will test the champions in many different ways their magical prowess their daring their powers of deduction and of course their ability to cope with danger 
 
 at this last word the hall was filled with a silence so absolute that nobody seemed to be breathing 
 
 as you know three champions compete in the tournament dumbledore went on calmly one from each of the participating schools they will be marked on how well they perform each of the tournament tasks and the champion with the highest total after task three will win the triwizard cup the champions will be chosen by an impartial selector the goblet of fire 
 
 dumbledore now took out his wand and tapped three times upon the top of the casket the lid creaked slowly open dumbledore reached inside it and pulled out a large roughly hewn wooden cup it would have been entirely unremarkable had it not been full to the brim with dancing flames 
 
 dumbledore closed the casket and placed the goblet carefully on top of it where it would be clearly visible to everyone in the hall 
 
 anybody wishing to submit themselves as champion must write their name and school clearly upon a slip of parchment and drop it into the goblet said dumbledore aspiring champions have hours in which to put their names forward tomorrow night halloween the goblet will return the names of the three it has judged most worthy to represent their schools the goblet will be placed in the entrance hall tonight where it will be freely accessible to all those wishing to compete 
 
 to ensure that no underage student yields to temptation said dumbledore i will be drawing an age line around the goblet of fire once it has been placed in the entrance hall nobody under the age of seventeen will be able to cross this line 
 
 finally i wish to impress upon any of you wishing to compete that this tournament is not to be entered into lightly once a champion has been selected by the goblet of fire he or she is obliged to see the tournament through to the end the placing of your name in the goblet constitutes a binding magical contract there can be no change of heart once you have become a champion please be very sure therefore that you are wholeheartedly prepared to play before you drop your name into the goblet now i think it is time for bed good night to you all 
 
 an age line fred weasley said his eyes glinting as they all made their way across the hall to the doors into the entrance hall well that should be fooled by an aging potion it and once your in that goblet laughing it tell whether seventeen or not 
 
 but i think anyone under seventeen will stand a chance said hermione we just learned enough 
 
 speak for yourself said george shortly try and get in you harry 
 
 harry thought briefly of insistence that nobody under seventeen should submit their name but then the wonderful picture of himself winning the triwizard tournament filled his mind wondered how angry dumbledore would be if someone younger than seventeen did find a way to get over the age line 
 
 where is he said ron who listening to a word of this conversation but looking through the crowd to see what had become of krum dumbledore say where the durmstrang people are sleeping did he 
 
 but this query was answered almost instantly they were level with the slytherin table now and karkaroff had just bustled up to his students 
 
 back to the ship then he was saying viktor how are you feeling did you eat enough should i send for some mulled wine from the kitchens 
 
 harry saw krum shake his head as he pulled his furs back on professor ivood like some vine said one of the other durmstrang boys hopefully 
 
 i offering it to you poliakoff snapped karkaroff his warmly paternal air vanishing in an instant i notice you have dribbled food all down the front of your robes again disgusting boy 
 
 karkaroff turned and led his students toward the doors reaching them at exactly the same moment as harry ron and hermione harry stopped to let him walk through first 
 
 thank you said karkaroff carelessly glancing at him 
 
 and then karkaroff froze he turned his head back to harry and stared at him as though he believe his eyes behind their headmaster the students from durmstrang came to a halt too eyes moved slowly up face and fixed upon his scar the durmstrang students were staring curiously at harry too out of the corner of his eye harry saw comprehension dawn on a few of their faces the boy with food all down his front nudged the girl next to him and pointed openly at forehead 
 
 yeah harry potter said a growling voice from behind them 
 
 professor karkaroff spun around moody was standing there leaning heavily on his staff his magical eye glaring unblinkingly at the durmstrang headmaster 
 
 the color drained from face as harry watched a terrible look of mingled fury and fear came over him 
 
 you he said staring at moody as though unsure he was really seeing him 
 
 me said moody grimly and unless got anything to say to potter karkaroff you might want to move blocking the doorway 
 
 it was true half the students in the hall were now waiting behind them looking over one shoulders to see what was causing the holdup 
 
 without another word professor karkaroff swept his students away with him moody watched him until he was out of sight his magical eye fixed upon his back a look of intense dislike upon his mutilated face 
 
 
 
 as the next day was saturday most students would normally have breakfasted late harry ron and hermione however were not alone in rising much earlier than they usually did on weekends when they went down into the entrance hall they saw about twenty people milling around it some of them eating toast all examining the goblet of fire it had been placed in the center of the hall on the stool that normally bore the sorting hat a thin golden line had been traced on the floor forming a circle ten feet around it in every direction 
 
 anyone put their name in yet ron asked a girl eagerly 
 
 all the durmstrang lot she replied but i seen anyone from hogwarts yet 
 
 bet some of them put it in last night after all gone to bed said harry i if it had been have wanted everyone watching what if the goblet just gobbed you right back out again 
 
 someone laughed behind harry turning he saw fred george and lee jordan hurrying down the staircase all three of them looking extremely excited 
 
 done it fred said in a triumphant whisper to harry ron and hermione just taken it 
 
 what said ron 
 
 the aging potion dung brains said fred 
 
 one drop each said george rubbing his hands together with glee we only need to be a few months older 
 
 going to split the thousand galleons between the three of us if one of us wins said lee grinning broadly 
 
 not sure this is going to work you know said hermione warningly sure dumbledore will have thought of this 
 
 fred george and lee ignored her 
 
 ready fred said to the other two quivering with excitement then go first 
 
 harry watched fascinated as fred pulled a slip of parchment out of his pocket bearing the words fred weasley hogwarts fred walked right up to the edge of the line and stood there rocking on his toes like a diver preparing for a drop then with the eyes of every person in the entrance hall upon him he took a great breath and stepped over the line 
 
 for a split second harry thought it had worked george certainly thought so for he let out a yell of triumph and leapt after fred but next moment there was a loud sizzling sound and both twins were hurled out of the golden circle as though they had been thrown by an invisible they landed painfully ten feet away on the cold stone floor and to add insult to injury there was a loud popping noise and both of them sprouted identical long white beards 
 
 the entrance hall rang with laughter even fred and george joined in once they had gotten to their feet and taken a good look at each beards 
 
 i did warn you said a deep amused voice and everyone turned to see professor dumbledore coming out of the great hall he surveyed fred and george his eyes twinkling i suggest you both go up to madam pomfrey she is already tending to miss fawcett of ravenclaw and mr summers of hufflepuff both of whom decided to age themselves up a little too though i must say neither of their beards is anything like as fine as yours 
 
 fred and george set off for the hospital wing accompanied by lee who was howling with laughter and harry ron and hermione also chortling went in to breakfast 
 
 the decorations in the great hall had changed this morning as it was halloween a cloud of live bats was fluttering around the enchanted ceiling while hundreds of carved pumpkins leered from every corner harry led the way over to dean and seamus who were discussing those hogwarts students of seventeen or over who might be entering 
 
 a rumor going around that warrington got up early and put his name in dean told harry that big bloke from slytherin who looks like a sloth 
 
 harry who had played quidditch against warrington shook his head in disgust 
 
 we have a slytherin champion 
 
 and all the hufflepuffs are talking about diggory said seamus contemptuously but i have thought have wanted to risk his good looks 
 
 listen said hermione suddenly 
 
 people were cheering out in the entrance hall they all swiveled around in their seats and saw angelina johnson coming into the hall grinning in an embarrassed sort of way a tall black girl who played chaser on the gryffindor quidditch team angelina came over to them sat down and said well done it just put my name in 
 
 kidding said ron looking impressed 
 
 are you seventeen then asked harry 
 
 course she is see a beard can you said ron 
 
 i had my birthday last week said angelina 
 
 well glad someone from entering said hermione i really hope you get it angelina 
 
 thanks hermione said angelina smiling at her 
 
 yeah better you than diggory said seamus causing several hufflepuffs passing their table to scowl heavily at him 
 
 we going to do today then ron asked harry and hermione when they had finished breakfast and were leaving the great hall 
 
 we been down to visit hagrid yet said harry 
 
 okay said ron just as long as he ask us to donate a few fingers to the skrewts 
 
 a look of great excitement suddenly dawned on face 
 
 just realized i asked hagrid to join yet she said brightly wait for me will you while i nip upstairs and get the badges 
 
 what is it with her said ron exasperated as hermione ran away up the marble staircase 
 
 hey ron said harry suddenly your friend 
 
 the students from beauxbatons were coming through the front doors from the grounds among them the those gathered around the goblet of fire stood back to let them pass watching eagerly 
 
 madame maxime entered the hall behind her students and organized them into a line one by one the beauxbatons students stepped across the age line and dropped their slips of parchment into the flames as each name entered the fire it turned briefly red and emitted sparks 
 
 what happen to the ones who chosen ron muttered to harry as the dropped her parchment into the goblet of fire reckon go back to school or hang around to watch the tournament 
 
 dunno said harry hang around i staying to judge she 
 
 when all the beauxbatons students had submitted their names madame maxime led them back out of the hall and out onto the grounds again 
 
 where are they sleeping then said ron moving toward the front doors and staring after them 
 
 a loud rattling noise behind them announced reappearance with the box of s p badges 
 
 oh good hurry up said ron and he jumped down the stone steps keeping his eyes on the back of the who was now halfway across the lawn with madame maxime 
 
 as they neared cabin on the edge of the forbidden forest the mystery of the beauxbatons sleeping quarters was solved the gigantic carriage in which they had arrived had been parked two hundred yards from front door and the students were climbing back inside it the elephantine flying horses that had pulled the carriage were now grazing in a makeshift paddock alongside it 
 
 harry knocked on door and booming barks answered instantly 
 
 bout time said hagrid when flung open the door thought you forgotten where i live 
 
 been really busy hag hermione started to say but then she stopped dead looking up at hagrid apparently lost for words 
 
 hagrid was wearing his best and very horrible hairy brown suit plus a checked tie this the worst of it though he had evidently tried to tame his hair using large quantities of what appeared to be axle grease it was now slicked down into two bunches perhaps he had tried a ponytail like but found he had too much hair the look really suit hagrid at all for a moment hermione goggled at him then obviously deciding not to comment she said erm where are the skrewts 
 
 out by the pumpkin patch said hagrid happily gettin massive mus be nearly three foot long now trouble is started killin each other 
 
 oh no really said hermione shooting a repressive look at ron who staring at odd hairstyle had just opened his mouth to say something about it 
 
 yeah said hagrid sadly s okay though got em in separate boxes now still got abou twenty 
 
 well lucky said ron hagrid missed the sarcasm 
 
 cabin comprised a single room in one corner of which was a gigantic bed covered in a patchwork quilt a similarly enormous wooden table and chairs stood in front of the fire beneath the quantity of cured hams and dead birds hanging from the ceiling they sat down at the table while hagrid started to make tea and were soon immersed in yet more discussion of the triwizard tournament hagrid seemed quite as excited about it as they were 
 
 you wait he said grinning you jus wait yer going ter see some stuff never seen before firs taskah but not supposed ter say 
 
 go on hagrid harry ron and hermione urged him but he just shook his head grinning 
 
 i don want ter spoil it fer yeh said hagrid but gonna be spectacular tell yeh that them going ter have their work cut out never thought live ter see the triwizard tournament played again 
 
 they ended up having lunch with hagrid though they eat much hagrid had made what he said was a beef casserole but after hermione unearthed a large talon in hers she harry and ron rather lost their appetites however they enjoyed themselves trying to make hagrid tell them what the tasks in the tournament were going to be speculating which of the entrants were likely to be selected as champions and wondering whether fred and george were beardless yet 
 
 a light rain had started to fall by midafternoon it was very cozy sitting by the fire listening to the gentle patter of the drops on the window watching hagrid darning his socks and arguing with hermione about for he flatly refused to join when she showed him her badges 
 
 be doin em an unkindness hermione he said gravely threading a massive bone needle with thick yellow yarn in their nature ter look after humans what they like see be makin em unhappy ter take away their work an insutin em if yeh tried ter pay em 
 
 but harry set dobby free and he was over the moon about it said hermione and we heard asking for wages now 
 
 yeah well yeh get weirdos in every breed not sayin there the odd elf take freedom but never persuade most of em ter do it no nothin doin hermione 
 
 hermione looked very cross indeed and stuffed her box of badges back into her cloak pocket 
 
 by half past five it was growing dark and ron harry and hermione decided it was time to get back up to the castle for the halloween feast and more important the announcement of the school champions 
 
 come with yeh said hagrid putting away his darning jus give us a sec 
 
 hagrid got up went across to the chest of drawers beside his bed and began searching for something inside it they pay too much attention until a truly horrible smell reached their nostrils coughing ron said hagrid that 
 
 eh said hagrid turning around with a large bottle in his hand don yeh like it 
 
 is that aftershave said hermione in a slightly choked voice 
 
 er eau de cologne hagrid muttered he was blushing 
 
 maybe a bit much he said gruffly go take it off hang on 
 
 he stumped out of the cabin and they saw him washing himself vigorously in the water barrel outside the window 
 
 eau de cologne said hermione in amazement hagrid 
 
 and with the hair and the suit said harry in an undertone 
 
 look said ron suddenly pointing out of the window hagrid had just straightened up and turned round if he had been blushing before it was nothing to what he was doing now getting to their feet very cautiously so that hagrid spot them harry ron and hermione peered through the window and saw that madame maxime and the beauxbatons students had just emerged from their carriage clearly about to set off for the feast too they hear what hagrid was saying but he was talking to madame maxime with a rapt expression harry had only ever seen him wear once before when he had been looking at the baby dragon norbert 
 
 going up to the castle with her said hermione indignantly i thought he was waiting for us 
 
 without so much as a backward glance at his cabin hagrid was trudging off up the grounds with madame maxime the beauxbatons students following in their wake jogging to keep up with their enormous strides 
 
 he fancies her said ron incredulously well if they end up having children be setting a world record bet any baby of theirs would weigh about a ton 
 
 they let themselves out of the cabin and shut the door behind them it was surprisingly dark outside drawing their cloaks more closely around themselves they set off up the sloping lawns 
 
 ooh them look hermione whispered 
 
 the durmstrang party was walking up toward the castle from the lake viktor krum was walking side by side with karkaroff and the other durmstrang students were straggling along behind them ron watched krum excitedly but krum did not look around as he reached the front doors a little ahead of hermione ron and harry and proceeded through them 
 
 when they entered the candlelit great hall it was almost full the goblet of fire had been moved it was now standing in front of empty chair at the teachers table fred and george again seemed to have taken their disappointment fairly well 
 
 hope angelina said fred as harry ron and hermione sat down 
 
 so do i said hermione breathlessly well soon know 
 
 the halloween feast seemed to take much longer than usual perhaps because it was their second feast in two days harry seem to fancy the extravagantly prepared food as much as he would have normally like everyone else in the hall judging by the constantly craning necks the impatient expressions on every face the fidgeting and the standing up to see whether dumbledore had finished eating yet harry simply wanted the plates to clear and to hear who had been selected as champions 
 
 at long last the golden plates returned to their original spotless state there was a sharp upswing in the level of noise within the hall which died away almost instantly as dumbledore got to his feet on either side of him professor karkaroff and madame maxime looked as tense and expectant as anyone ludo bagman was beaming and winking at various students mr crouch however looked quite uninterested almost bored 
 
 well the goblet is almost ready to make its decision said dumbledore i estimate that it requires one more minute now when the champions names are called i would ask them please to come up to the top of the hall walk along the staff table and go through into the next chamber he indicated the door behind the staff table where they will be receiving their first instructions 
 
 he took out his wand and gave a great sweeping wave with it at once all the candles except those inside the carved pumpkins were extinguished plunging them into a state of semidarkness the goblet of fire now shone more brightly than anything in the whole hall the sparkling bright of the flames almost painful on the eyes everyone watched few people kept checking their watches 
 
 any second lee jordan whispered two seats away from harry 
 
 the flames inside the goblet turned suddenly red again sparks began to fly from it next moment a tongue of flame shot into the air a charred piece of parchment fluttered out of it the whole room gasped 
 
 dumbledore caught the piece of parchment and held it at length so that he could read it by the light of the flames which had turned back to 
 
 the champion for durmstrang he read in a strong clear voice will be viktor krum 
 
 no surprises there yelled ron as a storm of applause and cheering swept the hall harry saw viktor krum rise from the slytherin table and slouch up toward dumbledore he turned right walked along the staff table and disappeared through the door into the next chamber 
 
 bravo viktor boomed karkaroff so loudly that everyone could hear him even over all the applause knew you had it in you 
 
 the clapping and chatting died down now attention was focused again on the goblet which seconds later turned red once more a second piece of parchment shot out of it propelled by the flames 
 
 the champion for beauxbatons said dumbledore is fleur delacour 
 
 her ron harry shouted as the girl who so resembled a veela got gracefully to her feet shook back her sheet of silvery blonde hair and swept up between the ravenclaw and hufflepuff tables 
 
 oh look all disappointed hermione said over the noise nodding toward the remainder of the beauxbatons party disappointed was a bit of an understatement harry thought two of the girls who had not been selected had dissolved into tears and were sobbing with their heads on their arms 
 
 when fleur delacour too had vanished into the side chamber silence fell again but this time it was a silence so stiff with excitement you could almost taste it the hogwarts champion next 
 
 and the goblet of fire turned red once more sparks showered out of it the tongue of flame shot high into the air and from its tip dumbledore pulled the third piece of parchment 
 
 the hogwarts champion he called is cedric diggory 
 
 no said ron loudly but nobody heard him except harry the uproar from the next table was too great every single hufflepuff had jumped to his or her feet screaming and stamping as cedric made his way past them grinning broadly and headed off toward the chamber behind the teachers table indeed the applause for cedric went on so long that it was some time before dumbledore could make himself heard again 
 
 excellent dumbledore called happily as at last the tumult died down well we now have our three champions i am sure i can count upon all of you including the remaining students from beauxbatons and durmstrang to give your champions every ounce of support you can muster by cheering your champion on you will contribute in a very real 
 
 but dumbledore suddenly stopped speaking and it was apparent to everybody what had distracted him 
 
 the fire in the goblet had just turned red again sparks were flying out of it a long flame shot suddenly into the air and borne upon it was another piece of parchment 
 
 automatically it seemed dumbledore reached out a long hand and seized the parchment he held it out and stared at the name written upon it there was a long pause during which dumbledore stared at the slip in his hands and everyone in the room stared at dumbledore and then dumbledore cleared his throat and read out 
 
 harry potter 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the goblet of fire
