lionfish nov chapter beyond the veilcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 black shapes were emerging out of thin air all around them blocking their way left and right eyes glinted through slits in hoods a dozen lit wand tips were pointing directly at their hearts ginny gave a gasp of horror 
 
 to me potter repeated the drawling voice of lucius malfoy as he held out his hand palm up 
 
 insides plummeted sickeningly they were trapped and outnumbered two to one 
 
 to me said malfoy yet again 
 
 sirius harry said 
 
 several of the death eaters laughed a harsh female voice from the midst of the shadowy figures to left said triumphantly the dark lord always knows 
 
 always echoed malfoy softly now give me the prophecy potter 
 
 i want to know where sirius is 
 
 i want to know where sirius is mimicked the woman to his left 
 
 she and her fellow death eaters had closed in so that they were mere feet away from harry and the others the light from their wands dazzling eyes 
 
 got him said harry ignoring the rising panic in his chest the dread he had been fighting since they had first entered the row here i know he is 
 
 the little baby woke up fwightened and fort what it dweamed was twoo said the woman in a horrible mock baby voice harry felt ron stir beside him 
 
 do anything harry muttered not yet 
 
 the woman who had mimicked him let out a raucous scream of laughter 
 
 you hear him you hear instructions to the other children as though he thinks of fighting us 
 
 oh you know potter as i do bellatrix said malfoy softly he has a great weakness for heroics the dark lord understands this about him now give me the prophecy potter 
 
 i know sirius is here said harry though panic was causing his chest to constrict and he felt as though he could not breathe properly i know got him 
 
 more of the death eaters laughed though the woman laughed loudest of all 
 
 time you learned the difference between life and dreams potter said malfoy now give me the prophecy or we start using wands 
 
 go on then said harry raising his own wand to chest height as he did so the five wands of ron hermione neville ginny and luna rose on either side of him the knot in stomach tightened if sirius really was not here he had led his friends to their deaths for no reason at all 
 
 but the death eaters did not strike 
 
 hand over the prophecy and no one need get hurt said malfoy coolly 
 
 it was turn to laugh 
 
 yeah right he said i give you thisprophecy is it and just let us skip off home will you 
 
 the words were hardly out of his mouth when the female death eater shrieked accio proph 
 
 harry was just ready for her he shouted protego before she had finished her spell and though the glass sphere slipped to the tips of his fingers he managed to cling on to it 
 
 oh he knows how to play little bitty baby potter she said her mad eyes staring through the slits in her hood very well then 
 
 i told you no lucius malfoy roared at the woman if you smash it 
 
 mind was racing the death eaters wanted this dusty sphere he had no interest in it he just wanted to get them all out of this alive to make sure none of his friends paid a terrible price for his stupidity 
 
 the woman stepped forward away from her fellows and pulled off her hood azkaban had hollowed bellatrix face making it gaunt and but it was alive with a feverish fanatical glow 
 
 you need more persuasion she said her chest rising and falling rapidly very welltake the smallest one she ordered the death eaters beside her let him watch while we torture the little girl do it 
 
 harry felt the others close in around ginny he stepped sideways so that he was right in front of her the prophecy held up to his chest 
 
 have to smash this if you want to attack any of us he told bellatrix i think your boss will be too pleased if you come back without it will he 
 
 she did not move she merely stared at him the tip of her tongue moistening her thin mouth 
 
 so said harry what kind of prophecy are we talking about anyway 
 
 he could not think what to do but to keep talking arm was pressed against his and he could feel him shaking he could feel one of the others quickened breath on the back of his head he was hoping they were all thinking hard about ways to get out of this because his mind was blank 
 
 what kind of prophecy repeated bellatrix the grin fading from her face you jest harry potter 
 
 nope not jesting said harry his eyes flicking from death eater to death eater looking for a weak link a space through which they could escape how come voldemort wants it 
 
 several of the death eaters let out low hisses 
 
 you dare speak his name whispered bellatrix 
 
 yeah said harry maintaining his tight grip on the glass ball expecting another attempt to bewitch it from him yeah got no problem with saying vol 
 
 shut your mouth bellatrix shrieked you dare speak his name with your unworthy lips you dare besmirch it with your tongue you dare 
 
 did you know a too said harry recklessly hermione gave a little moan in his ear voldemort yeah his mother was a witch but his dad was a muggleor has he been telling you lot 
 
 stupef 
 
 no 
 
 a jet of red light had shot from the end of bellatrix wand but malfoy had deflected it his spell caused hers to hit the shelf a foot to the left of harry and several of the glass orbs there shattered 
 
 two figures as ghosts fluid as smoke unfurled themselves from the fragments of broken glass upon the floor and each began to speak their voices vied with each other so that only fragments of what they were saying could be heard over malfoy and shouts 
 
 at the solstice will come a new said the figure of an old bearded man 
 
 do not attack we need the prophecy 
 
 he daredhe dares shrieked bellatrix incoherently he stands therefilthy 
 
 wait got the prophecy bawled malfoy 
 
 and none will come after said the figure of a young woman 
 
 the two figures that had burst from the shattered spheres had melted into thin air nothing remained of them or their erstwhile homes but fragments of glass upon the floor they had however given harry an idea the problem was going to be conveying it to the others 
 
 you told me so special about this prophecy supposed to be handing over he said playing for time he moved his foot slowly sideways feeling around for someone 
 
 do not play games with us potter said malfoy 
 
 not playing games said harry half his mind on the conversation half on his wandering foot and then he found toes and pressed down upon them a sharp intake of breath behind him told him they were 
 
 what she whispered 
 
 dumbledore never told you the reason you bear that scar was hidden in the bowels of the department of mysteries malfoy sneered 
 
 iwhat said harry and for a moment he quite forgot his plan what about my scar 
 
 what whispered hermione more urgently behind him 
 
 can this be said malfoy sounding maliciously delighted some of the death eaters were laughing again and under cover of their laughter harry hissed to hermione moving his lips as little as possible smash shelves 
 
 dumbledore never told you malfoy repeated well this explains why you come earlier potter the dark lord wondered why 
 
 when i say now 
 
 you come running when he showed you the place where it was hidden in your dreams he thought natural curiosity would make you want to hear the exact wording 
 
 did he said harry behind him he felt rather than heard hermione passing his message to the others and he sought to keep talking to distract the death eaters so he wanted me to come and get it did he why 
 
 why malfoy sounded incredulously delighted because the only people who are permitted to retrieve a prophecy from the department of mysteries potter are those about whom it was made as the dark lord discovered when he attempted to use others to steal it for him 
 
 and why did he want to steal a prophecy about me 
 
 about both of you potter about both of you you ever wondered why the dark lord tried to kill you as a baby 
 
 harry stared into the slitted through which grey eyes were gleaming was this prophecy the reason parents had died the reason he carried his scar was the answer to all of this clutched in his hand 
 
 someone made a prophecy about voldemort and me he said quietly gazing at lucius malfoy his fingers tightening over the warm glass sphere in his hand it was hardly larger than a snitch and still gritty with dust and made me come and get it for him why he come and get it himself 
 
 get it himself shrieked bellatrix over a cackle of mad laughter 
 
 the dark lord walk into the ministry of magic when they are so sweetly ignoring his return the dark lord reveal himself to the aurors when at the moment they are wasting their time on my dear cousin 
 
 so got you doing his dirty work for him has he said harry like he tried to get sturgis to steal itand bode 
 
 very good potter very good said malfoy slowly but the dark lord knows you are not unintell 
 
 now yelled harry 
 
 five different voices behind him bellowed reducto five curses flew in five different directions and the shelves opposite them exploded as they hit the towering structure swayed as a hundred glass spheres burst apart figures unfurled into the air and floated there their voices echoing from who knew what past amid the torrent of crashing glass and splintered wood now raining down upon the floor 
 
 run harry yelled as the shelves swayed precariously and more glass spheres began to fall from above he seized a handful of robes and dragged her forwards holding one arm over his head as chunks of shelf and shards of glass thundered down upon them a death eater lunged forwards through the cloud of dust and harry elbowed him hard in the masked face they were all yelling there were cries of pain and thunderous crashes as the shelves collapsed upon themselves weirdly echoing fragments of the seers unleashed from their spheres 
 
 harry found the way ahead clear and saw ron ginny and luna sprint past him their arms over their heads something heavy struck him on the side of the face but he merely ducked his head and sprinted onwards a hand caught him by the shoulder he heard hermione shout stupefy the hand released him at once 
 
 they were at the end of row harry turned right and began to sprint in earnest he could hear footsteps right behind him and voice urging neville on straight ahead the door through which they had come was ajar harry could see the glittering light of the bell jar he pelted through the doorway the prophecy still clutched tight and safe in his hand and waited for the others to hurtle over the threshold before slamming the door behind them 
 
 colloportus gasped hermione and the door sealed itself with an odd squelching noise 
 
 wherewhere are the others gasped harry 
 
 he had thought ron luna and ginny were ahead of them that they would be waiting in this room but there was nobody there 
 
 they must have gone the wrong way whispered hermione terror in her face 
 
 listen whispered neville 
 
 footsteps and shouts echoed from behind the door they had just sealed harry put his ear close to the door to listen and heard lucius malfoy roar leave nott leave him i say his injuries will be nothing to the dark lord compared to losing that prophecy jugson come back here we need to organise split into pairs and search and forget be gentle with potter until got the prophecy you can kill the others if necessarybellatrix rodolphus you take the left crabbe rabastan go rightjugson dolohov the door straight aheadmacnair and avery through hererookwood over there mulciber come with me 
 
 what do we do hermione asked harry trembling from head to foot 
 
 well we stand here waiting for them to find us for a start said harry get away from this door 
 
 they ran as quietly as they could past the shimmering bell jar where the tiny egg was hatching and unhatching towards the exit into the circular hallway at the far end of the room they were almost there when harry heard something large and heavy collide with the door hermione had charmed shut 
 
 stand aside said a rough voice alohomora 
 
 as the door flew open harry hermione and neville dived under desks they could see the bottom of the two death eaters robes drawing nearer their feet moving rapidly 
 
 they run straight through to the hall said the rough voice 
 
 check under the desks said another 
 
 harry saw the knees of the death eaters bend poking his wand out from under the desk he shouted stupefy 
 
 a jet of red light hit the nearest death eater he fell backwards into a grandfather clock and knocked it over the second death eater however had leapt aside to avoid spell and was pointing his own wand at hermione who was crawling out from under the desk to get a better aim 
 
 avada 
 
 harry launched himself across the floor and grabbed the death eater around the knees causing him to topple and his aim to go awry neville overturned a desk in his anxiety to help and pointing his wand wildly at the struggling pair he cried 
 
 expelliarmus 
 
 both and the death wands flew out of their hands and soared back towards the entrance to the hall of prophecy both scrambled to their feet and charged after them the death eater in front harry hot on his heels and neville bringing up the rear plainly horrorstruck by what he had done 
 
 get out of the way harry yelled neville clearly determined to repair the damage 
 
 harry flung himself sideways as neville took aim again and shouted 
 
 stupefy 
 
 the jet of red light flew right over the death eaters shoulder and hit a cabinet on the wall full of variously shaped the cabinet fell to the floor and burst apart glass flying everywhere sprang back up on to the wall fully mended then fell down again and shattered 
 
 the death eater had snatched up his wand which lay on the floor beside the glittering bell jar harry ducked down behind another desk as the man turned his mask had slipped so that he see he ripped it off with his free hand and shouted stup 
 
 stupefy screamed hermione who had just caught up with them the jet of red light hit the death eater in the middle of his chest he froze his arm still raised his wand fell to the floor with a flatter and he collapsed backwards towards the bell jar harry expected to hear a clunk for the man to hit solid glass and slide off the jar on to the floor but instead his head sank through the surface of the bell jar as though it were nothing but a soap bubble and he came to rest sprawled on his back on the table with his head lying inside the jar full of glittering wind 
 
 accio wand cried hermione wand flew from a dark corner into her hand and she threw it to him 
 
 thanks he said right get out of 
 
 look out said neville horrified he was staring at the death head in the bell jar 
 
 all three of them raised their wands again but none of them struck they were all gazing appalled at what was happening to the head 
 
 it was shrinking very fast growing balder and balder the black hair and stubble retracting into his skull his cheeks becoming smooth his skull round and covered with a peachlike fuzz 
 
 a head now sat grotesquely on top of the thick muscled neck of the death eater as he struggled to get up again but even as they watched their mouths open the head began to swell to its previous proportions again thick black hair was sprouting from the pate and chin 
 
 time said hermione in an awestruck voice time 
 
 the death eater shook his ugly head again trying to clear it but before he could pull himself together it began to shrink back to babyhood once more 
 
 there was a shout from a room nearby then a crash and a scream 
 
 ron harry yelled turning quickly from the monstrous transformation taking place before them ginny luna 
 
 harry hermione screamed 
 
 the death eater had pulled his head out of the bell jar his appearance was utterly bizarre his tiny head bawling loudly while his thick arms flailed dangerously in all directions narrowly missing harry who had ducked harry raised his wand but to his amazement hermione seized his arm 
 
 you hurt a baby 
 
 there was no time to argue the point harry could hear more footsteps growing louder from the hall of prophecy and knew too late that he ought not to have shouted and given away their position 
 
 come on he said and leaving the ugly death eater staggering behind them they took off for the door that stood open at the other end of the room leading back into the black hallway 
 
 they had run halfway towards it when harry saw through the open door two more death eaters running across the black room towards them veering left he burst instead into a small dark cluttered office and slammed the door behind them 
 
 collo began hermione but before she could complete the spell the door had burst open and the two death eaters had come hurtling inside 
 
 with a cry of triumph both yelled 
 
 impedimenta 
 
 harry hermione and neville were all knocked backwards off their feet neville was thrown over the desk and disappeared from view hermione smashed into a bookcase and was promptly deluged in a cascade of heavy books the back of head slammed into the stone wall behind him tiny lights burst in front of his eyes and for a moment he was too dizzy and bewildered to react 
 
 got him yelled the death eater nearest harry in an office off 
 
 silencio cried hermione and the voice was extinguished he continued to mouth through the hole in his mask but no sound came out he was thrust aside by his fellow death eater 
 
 petrificus totalus shouted harry as the second death eater raised his wand his arms and legs snapped together and he fell forwards face down on to the rug at feet stiff as a board and unable to move 
 
 well done ha 
 
 but the death eater hermione had just struck dumb made a sudden slashing movement with his wand a streak of what looked like purple flame passed right across chest she gave a tiny oh as though of surprise and crumpled on to the floor where she lay motionless 
 
 hermione 
 
 harry fell to his knees beside her as neville crawled rapidly towards her from under the desk his wand held up in front of him the death eater kicked out hard at head as he emergedhis foot broke wand in two and connected with his face neville gave a howl of pain and recoiled clutching his mouth and nose harry twisted around his own wand held high and saw that the death eater had ripped off his mask and was pointing his wand directly at harry who recognised the long pale twisted face from the daily dolohov the wizard who had murdered the prewetts 
 
 dolohov grinned with his free hand he pointed from the prophecy still clutched in hand to himself then at hermione though he could no longer speak his meaning could not have been clearer give me the prophecy or you get the same as her 
 
 like you kill us all anyway the moment i hand it over said harry 
 
 a whine of panic inside his head was preventing him thinking properly he had one hand on shoulder which was still warm yet did not dare look at her properly let her be dead let her be dead my fault if dead 
 
 whaddever you do harry said neville fiercely from under the desk lowering his hands to show a clearly broken nose and blood pouring down his mouth and chin gib it to him 
 
 then there was a crash outside the door and dolohov looked over his shoulderthe death eater had appeared in the doorway his head bawling his great fists still flailing uncontrollably at everything around him harry seized his chance 
 
 petrificus totalus 
 
 the spell hit dolohov before he could block it and he toppled forwards across his comrade both of them rigid as boards and unable to move an inch 
 
 hermione harry said at once shaking her as the death eater blundered out of sight again hermione wake up 
 
 whaddid he do to her said neville crawling out from under the desk to kneel at her other side blood streaming from his rapidly swelling nose 
 
 i dunno 
 
 neville groped for wrist 
 
 a pulse harry sure id is 
 
 such a powerful wave of relief swept through harry that for a moment he felt 
 
 alive 
 
 yeah i dink so 
 
 there was a pause in which harry listened hard for the sound of more footsteps but all he could hear were the whimpers and blunderings of the death eater in the next room 
 
 neville not far from the exit harry whispered right next to that circular room if we can just get you across it and find the right door before any more death eaters come bet you can get hermione up the corridor and into the lift then you could find someone raise the alarm 
 
 and whad are you going do do said neville mopping his bleeding nose with his sleeve and frowning at harry 
 
 got to find the others said harry 
 
 well going do find dem wid you said neville firmly 
 
 but hermione 
 
 dake her wid us said neville firmly carry bedder at fighding dem dan i ab 
 
 he stood up and seized one of arms glaring at harry who hesitated then grabbed the other and helped hoist limp form over shoulders 
 
 wait said harry snatching up wand from the floor and shoving it into hand better take this 
 
 neville kicked aside the broken fragments of his own wand as they walked slowly towards the door 
 
 my going do kill be said neville thickly blood spattering from his nose as he spoke dat was by old wand 
 
 harry stuck his head out of the door and looked around cautiously the death eater was screaming and banging into things toppling grandfather clocks and overturning desks bawling and confused while the cabinet that harry now suspected had contained continued to fall shatter and repair itself on the wall behind them 
 
 never going to notice us he whispered keep close behind me 
 
 they crept out of the office and back towards the door into the black hallway which now seemed completely deserted they walked a few steps forwards neville tottering slightly due to weight the door of the time room swung shut behind them and the walls began to rotate once more the recent blow on the back of head seemed to have unsteadied him he narrowed his eyes swaying slightly until the walls stopped moving again with a sinking heart harry saw that fiery crosses had faded from the doors 
 
 so which way reck 
 
 but before they could make a decision as to which way to try a door to their right sprang open and three people fell out of it 
 
 ron croaked harry dashing towards them ginnyare you all 
 
 harry said ron giggling weakly lurching forwards seizing the front of robes and gazing at him with unfocused eyes there you are ha ha ha you look funny harry all messed up 
 
 face was very white and something dark was trickling from the corner of his mouth next moment his knees had given way but he still clutched the front of robes so that harry was pulled into a kind of bow 
 
 ginny harry said fearfully what happened 
 
 but ginny shook her head and slid down the wall into a sitting position panting and holding her ankle 
 
 i think her broken i heard something crack whispered luna who was bending over her and who alone seemed to be unhurt four of them chased us into a dark room full of planets it was a very odd place some of the time we were just floating in the dark 
 
 harry we saw uranus up close said ron still giggling feebly get it harry we saw uranusha ha ha 
 
 a bubble of blood grew at the corner of mouth and burst 
 
 anyway one of them grabbed foot i used the reductor curse and blew up pluto in his face but 
 
 luna gestured hopelessly at ginny who was breathing in a very shallow way her eyes still closed 
 
 and what about ron said harry fearfully as ron continued to giggle still hanging off the front of robes 
 
 i know what they hit him with said luna sadly but gone a bit funny i could hardly get him along at all 
 
 harry said ron pulling ear down to his mouth and still giggling weakly you know who this girl is harry loony loony lovegood ha ha ha 
 
 got to get out of here said harry firmly luna can you help ginny 
 
 yes said luna sticking her wand behind her ear for safekeeping then putting an arm around waist and pulling her up 
 
 only my ankle i can do it myself said ginny impatiently but next moment she had collapsed sideways and grabbed luna for support harry pulled arm over his shoulder just as so many months ago he had pulled he looked around they had a one in twelve chance of getting the exit right first time 
 
 he heaved ron towards a door they were within a few feet of it when another door across the hall burst open and three death eaters sped in led by bellatrix lestrange 
 
 there they are she shrieked 
 
 stunning spells shot across the room harry smashed his way through the door ahead flung ron unceremoniously from him and ducked back to help neville in with hermione they were all over the threshold just in time to slam the door against bellatrix 
 
 colloportus shouted harry and he heard three bodies slam into the door on the other side 
 
 it matter said a voice there are other ways got them here 
 
 harry span around they were back in the brain room and sure enough there were doors all around the walls he could hear footsteps in the hall behind them as more death eaters came running to join the first 
 
 lunaneville help me 
 
 the three of them tore around the room sealing the doors as they went harry crashed into a tbale and rolled over the top of it in his haste to reach the next door 
 
 colloportus 
 
 there were footsteps running along behind the doors every now and then another heavy body would launch itself against one so it creaked and shuddered luna and neville were bewitching the doors along the opposite wallthen as harry reached the very top of the room he heard luna cry 
 
 colloaaaaaaaaargh 
 
 he turned in time to see her flying through the air five death eaters were surging into the room through the door she had not reached in time luna hit a desk slid over its surface and on to the floor on the other side where she lay sprawled as still as hermione 
 
 get potter shrieked bellatrix and she ran at him he dodged her and sprinted back up the room he was safe as long as they thought they might hit the prophecy 
 
 hey said ron who had staggered to his feet and was now tottering drunkenly towards harry giggling hey harry there are brains in here ha ha ha that weird harry 
 
 ron get out of the way get down 
 
 but ron had already pointed his wand at the tank 
 
 honest harry brainslookaccio brain 
 
 the scene seemed momentarily frozen harry ginny and neville and each of the death eaters turned in spite of themselves to watch the top of the tank as a brain burst from the green liquid like a leaping fish for a moment it seemed suspended in midair then it soared towards ron spinning as it came and what looked like ribbons of moving images flew from it unravelling like rolls of film 
 
 ha ha ha harry look at it said ron watching it disgorge its gaudy innards harry come and touch it bet weird 
 
 ron no 
 
 harry did not know what would happen if ron touched the tentacles of thought now flying behind the brain but he was sure it would not be anything good he darted forwards but ron had already caught the brain in his outstretched hands 
 
 the moment they made contact with his skin the tentacles began wrapping themselves around arms like ropes 
 
 harry look happennonoi like itno stopstop 
 
 but the thin ribbons were spinning around chest now he tugged and tore at them as the brain was pulled tight against him like an body 
 
 diffindo yelled harry trying to sever the feelers wrapping themselves tightly around ron before his eyes but they would not break ron fell over still thrashing against his bonds 
 
 harry suffocate him screamed ginny immobilised by her broken ankle on the floor then a jet of red light flew from one of the death wands and hit her squarely in the face she keeled over sideways and lay there unconscious 
 
 stubefy shouted neville wheeling around and waving wand at the oncoming death eaters stubefy stubefy 
 
 but nothing happened 
 
 one of the death eaters shot their own stunning spell at neville it missed him by inches harry and neville were now the only two left fighting the five death eaters two of whom sent off streams of silver light like arrows which missed but left craters in the wall behind them harry ran for it as bellatrix lestrange raced right at him holding the prophecy high above his head he sprinted back up the room all he could think of doing was to draw the death eaters away from the others 
 
 it seemed to have worked they streaked after him knocking chairs and tables flying but not daring to bewitch him in case they hurt the prophecy and he dashed through the only door still open the one through which the death eaters themselves had come inwardly praying that neville would stay with ron and find some way of releasing him he ran a few feet into the new room and felt the floor vanish 
 
 he was falling down steep stone step after steep stone step bouncing on every tier until at last with a crash that knocked all the breath out of his body he landed flat on his back in the sunken pit where the stone archway stood on its dais the whole room was ringing with the death laughter he looked up and saw the five who had been in the brain room descending towards him while as many more emerged through other doorways and began leaping from bench to bench towards him harry got to his feet though his legs were trembling so badly they barely supported him the prophecy was still miraculously unbroken in his left hand his wand clutched tightly in his right he backed away looking around trying to keep all the death eaters within his sight the back of his legs hit something solid he had reached the dais where the archway stood he climbed backwards onto it 
 
 the death eaters all halted gazing at him some were panting as hard as he was one was bleeding badly dolohov freed of the curse was leering his wand pointing straight at face 
 
 potter your race is run drawled lucius malfoy pulling off his mask now hand me the prophecy like a good boy 
 
 letlet the others go and give it to you said harry desperately 
 
 a few of the death eaters laughed 
 
 you are not in a position to bargain potter said lucius malfoy his pale face flushed with pleasure you see there are ten of us and only one of you or dumbledore ever taught you how to count 
 
 dot alone shouted a voice from above them still god be 
 
 heart sank neville was scrambling down the stone benches towards them wand held fast in his trembling hand 
 
 nevilleno go back to ron 
 
 stubefy neville shouted again pointing his wand at each death eater in turn stubefy stube 
 
 one of the largest death eaters seized neville from behind pinioning his arms to his sides he struggled and kicked several of the death eaters laughed 
 
 longbottom it sneered lucius malfoy well your grandmother is used to losing family members to our cause your death will not come as a great shock 
 
 longbottom repeated bellatrix and a truly evil smile lit her gaunt face why i have had the pleasure of meeting your parents boy 
 
 i doe you hab roared neville and he fought so hard against his encircling grip that the death eater shouted someone stun him 
 
 no no no said bellatrix she looked transported alive with excitement as she glanced at harry then back at neville no see how long longbottom lasts before he cracks like his parents unless potter wants to give us the prophecy 
 
 gib id do dem roared neville who seemed beside himself kicking and writhing as bellatrix drew nearer to him and his captor her wand raised gib id do dem harry 
 
 bellatrix raised her wand crucio 
 
 neville screamed his legs drawn up to his chest so that the death eater holding him was momentarily holding him off the ground the death eater dropped him and he fell to the floor twitching and screaming in agony 
 
 that was just a taster said bellatrix raising her wand so that screams stopped and he lay sobbing at her feet she turned and gazed up at harry now potter either give us the prophecy or watch your little friend die the hard way 
 
 harry did not have to think there was no choice the prophecy was hot with the heat of his clutching hand as he held it out malfoy jumped forwards to take it 
 
 then high above them two more doors burst open and five more people sprinted into the room sirius lupin moody tonks and kingsley 
 
 malfoy turned and raised his wand but tonks had already sent a stunning spell right at him harry did not wait to see whether it had made contact but dived off the dais out of the way the death eaters were completely distracted by the appearance of the members of the order who were now raining spells down upon them as they jumped from step to step towards the sunken floor through the darting bodies the flashes of light harry could see neville crawling along he dodged another jet of red light and flung himself flat on the ground to reach neville 
 
 are you ok he yelled as another spell soared inches over their heads 
 
 yes said neville trying to pull himself up 
 
 and ron 
 
 i dink all righdhe was still fighding de brain when i lefd 
 
 the stone floor between them exploded as a spell hit it leaving a crater right where hand had been only seconds before both scrambled away from the spot then a thick arm came out of nowhere seized harry around the neck and pulled him upright so that his toes were barely touching the floor 
 
 give it to me growled a voice in his ear give me the prophecy 
 
 the man was pressing so tightly on windpipe that he could not breathe through watering eyes he saw sirius duelling with a death eater some ten feet away kingsley was fighting two at once tonks still halfway up the tiered seats was firing spells down at bellatrixnobody seemed to realise that harry was dying he turned his wand backwards towards the side but had no breath to utter an incantation and the free hand was groping towards the hand in which harry was grasping the prophecy 
 
 aargh 
 
 neville had come lunging out of nowhere unable to articulate a spell he had jabbed wand hard into the eyehole of the death mask the man relinquished harry at once with a howl of pain harry whirled around to face him and gasped 
 
 stupefy 
 
 the death eater keeled over backwards and his mask slipped off it was macnair killer one of his eyes now swollen and bloodshot 
 
 thanks harry said to neville pulling him aside as sirius and his death eater lurched past duelling so fiercely that their wands were blurs then foot made contact with something round and hard and he slipped for a moment he thought he had dropped the prophecy but then he saw magical eye spinning away across the floor 
 
 its owner was lying on his side bleeding from the head and his attacker was now bearing down upon harry and neville dolohov his long pale face twisted with glee 
 
 tarantallegra he shouted his wand pointing at neville whose legs went immediately into a kind of frenzied unbalancing him and causing him to fall to the floor again now potter 
 
 he made the same slashing movement with his wand that he had used on hermione just as harry yelled protego 
 
 harry felt something streak across his face like a blunt knife the force of it knocked him sideways and he fell over jerking legs but the shield charm had stopped the worst of the spell 
 
 dolohov raised his wand again accio proph 
 
 sirius had hurtled out of nowhere rammed dolohov with his shoulder and sent him flying out of the way the prophecy had again flown to the tips of fingers but he had managed to cling on to it now sirius and dolohov were duelling their wands flashing like swords sparks flying from their 
 
 dolohov drew back his wand to make the same slashing movement he had used on harry and hermione springing up harry yelled petrificus totalus once again arms and legs snapped together and he keeled over backwards landing with a crash on his back 
 
 nice one shouted sirius forcing head down as a pair of stunning spells flew towards them now i want you to get out of 
 
 they both ducked again a jet of green light had narrowly missed sirius across the room harry saw tonks fall from halfway up the stone steps her limp form toppling from stone seat to stone seat and bellatrix triumphant running back towards the fray 
 
 harry take the prophecy grab neville and run sirius yelled dashing to meet bellatrix harry did not see what happened next kingsley swayed across his field of vision battling with the pockmarked and no longer masked rookwood another jet of green light flew over head as he launched himself towards neville 
 
 can you stand he bellowed in ear as legs jerked and twitched uncontrollably put your arm round my neck 
 
 neville did so harry legs were still lying in every direction they would not support him and then out of nowhere a man lunged at them both fell backwards legs waving wildly like an overturned harry with his left arm held up in the air to try to save the small glass ball from being smashed 
 
 the prophecy give me the prophecy potter snarled lucus voice in his ear and harry felt the tip of wand pressing hard between his ribs 
 
 nogetoff me nevillecatch it 
 
 harry flung the prophecy across the floor neville span himself around on his back and scooped the ball to his chest malfoy pointed the wand instead at neville but harry jabbed his own wand back over his shoulder and yelled impedimenta 
 
 malfoy was blasted off his back as harry scrambled up again he looked around and saw malfoy smash into the dais on which sirius and bellatrix were now duelling malfoy aimed his wand at harry and neville again but before he could draw breath to strike lupin had jumped between them 
 
 harry round up the others and go 
 
 harry seized neville by the shoulder of his robes and lifted him bodily on to the first tier of stone steps legs twitched and jerked and would not support his weight harry heaved again with all the strength he possessed and they climbed another step 
 
 a spell hit the stone bench at heel it crumbled away and he fell back to the step below neville sank to the ground his legs still jerking and thrashing and he thrust the prophecy into his pocket 
 
 come on said harry desperately hauling at robes just try and push with your legs 
 
 he gave another stupendous heave and robes tore all along the left seamthe small ball dropped from his pocket and before either of them could catch it one of floundering feet kicked it it flew some ten feet to their right and smashed on the step beneath them as both of them stared at the place where it had broken appalled at what had happened a figure with hugely magnified eyes rose into the air unnoticed by any but them harry could see its mouth moving but in all the crashes and screams and yells surrounding them not one word of the prophecy could he hear the figure stopped speaking and dissolved into nothingness 
 
 harry sorry cried neville his face anguished as his legs continued to flounder so sorry harry i bean do 
 
 it matter harry shouted just try and stand get out of 
 
 dubbledore said neville his sweaty face suddenly transported staring over shoulder 
 
 what 
 
 dubbledore 
 
 harry turned to look where neville was staring directly above them framed in the doorway from the brain room stood albus dumbledore his wand aloft his face white and furious harry felt a kind of electric charge surge through every particle of his bodythey were saved 
 
 dumbledore sped down the steps past neville and harry who had no more thoughts of leaving dumbledore was already at the foot of the steps when the death eaters nearest realised he was there and yelled to the others one of the death eaters ran for it scrabbling like a monkey up the stone steps opposite spell pulled him back as easily and effortlessly as though he had hooked him with an invisible line 
 
 only one pair was still battling apparently unaware of the new arrival harry saw sirius duck jet of red light he was laughing at her 
 
 come on you can do better than that he yelled his voice echoing around the cavernous room 
 
 the second jet of light hit him squarely on the chest 
 
 the laughter had not quite died from his face but his eyes widened in shock 
 
 harry released neville though he was unaware of doing so he was jumping down the steps again pulling out his wand as dumbledore too turned towards the dais 
 
 it seemed to take sirius an age to fall his body curved in a graceful arc as he sank backwards through the ragged veil hanging from the arch 
 
 harry saw the look of mingled fear and surprise on his wasted face as he fell through the ancient doorway and disappeared behind the veil which fluttered for a moment as though in a high wind then fell back into place 
 
 harry heard bellatrix triumphant scream but knew it meant nothingsirius had only just fallen through the archway he would reappear from the other side any second 
 
 but sirius did not reappear 
 
 sirius harry yelled sirius 
 
 he had reached the floor his breath coming in searing gasps sirius must be just behind the curtain he harry would pull him back out 
 
 but as he reached the ground and sprinted towards the dais lupin grabbed harry around the chest holding him back 
 
 nothing you can do harry 
 
 get him save him only just gone through 
 
 too late harry 
 
 we can still reach him harry struggled hard and viciously but lupin would not let go 
 
 nothing you can do harry nothing gone 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix
